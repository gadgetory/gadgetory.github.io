here that this video has a lot of static
especially users wearing headphones so I
want you be mindful of that prior to
listening to this video but we decide to
keep it anyways because PocketNow is a
friend of android authority and we've
been planning this video for a very very
long time so hopefully you enjoy it and
please accept our sincerest apologies
for the static enjoy why is it ready or
not it's Josh McMasters what's going on
everybody and I know a lot of you out
there are probably really loving the
video right now because you see who's in
the middle between me and lawn over
there we got pocket now in the house
Michael Fisher and hi mayor Nevada and
we go ahead and hand the mic on over to
you guys and you can just sort of give
our viewers a little bit about
yourselves a little bit of info
especially for the few of the very very
few I'm sure I mean I know who you guys
are and if you did oh he's the actor
he's the one who extra for Robert Downey
jr. is out right summer recovering I am
I would say how many would call me
pocket now's lead review device quarters
suppose I do most of our video content
and Jaime hangs out hangs out in
Honduras wanting more Bluetooth headsets
is that right you thank you I appreciate
it I'm still waiting I'm as on your
screens everyday actually on the pocket
now daily bringing you three-minute news
show that I quite like every time I
watch it which is about once a month
right exactly
weekly every week and that's about what
we do we talk about mobile technology
just like you do Josh beautiful it's
worth mentioning that right before this
video was here we were chumming it up
I'm sure that there was a little bit of
footage of that already
and then the moment I had Michael the
mic he gets all professional and he
sounds exactly like his videos every
single time it is extremely on yeah
normally I'm just dropping f-bombs and
driving badly and ordering bad coffee oh
man we are the competitive snorers I'm
not sure if you do that but it's a lot
of fun no one has been okay set up the
decibel meter and well the fact that no
one has told me tells me either I'm
really bad or really good so I'm just
afraid to hurt your feelings
that's okay
surely the feeling is mutual especially
between our two respective channels we
have LAN over here and yes he did
we were able to go out and see and yes
this is the first time hi mate has seen
the hair alright yeah we had that on for
first recap video actually are weird
here at CES video anyways we got a lot
of great feedback you know what we're
gonna take this time then do you there's
got to be a story behind it aside from
you just coming here what is the story
behind that because it also says 2015
back there so tell us about that
I mean I already said it several times
it's it's it's my dream it was my dream
to come to this show and this is you
know you guys already know I've said it
a couple times already
it's my first time here and I wanted to
make it special by by doing something
different and that's the whole reason
behind you know the CES on the side of
my head and the 2015 on the other side
so yeah well I'll get one next year but
yeah that's that was really the whole
idea behind it it's just I wanted to
make my first time you know memorable
and special in some way and I figured
you know why not getting cut inside of
my head so and I ever really got good
barber so I trusted him and the funny
thing is like when he kept a 2015 on the
side of my head
he actually put 2014 so you had to fix
it yeah 2015 but
yeah he had I was scared for a minute so
but you know it's it turned out good so
so that's really story behind it that's
an awesome story because I think we can
all remember a time in our lives before
we covered this stuff and if you were me
you read to everyone else covering the
stuff and you thought like man I must be
a biggest weirdo in the world for
wanting to go to like a trade show but I
was so so enamored of CES in particular
then I totally feel you on that I think
it's really cool that you expressed it
that way so that's that's awesome well
absolutely and we had a pretty eventful
day already I'm not sure how you guys
Tuesday wine I mean you you were able to
go see those TVs that you wanted to see
so much all right Sony the Android 4k
brah vias that's awesome
I actually had a really interesting run
in with FUBU
you know foo who they created the newbie
and ubi they look if I remember
correctly every time at the clothing
designer not FUBU yeah right that's what
we thought for a second too but they
make these tablets that are for
adolescents from from from infant age
all the way to preteen age and their
focus is improving education for all
kids rather than just have a
manufacturer create like a parent mode
they created a whole ecosystem around
the education of a child and I thought I
was amazing and we were able to take a
look at that for a little while yeah it
was really awesome
but what has your guys's they've been
like so far and and even this is our for
today is the actual start of CES but
we've been at this for about two three
days now how was your guys's experience
with so far experience for the show is
easier to answer because days are not
really if you know how it is I don't
know what today is relative to yesterday
yeah but we have we have been really
really really excited and really really
disappointed and it happens every see it
happens at every trade show for that
matter but it's specifically what we
cover we focus on mobile promise CES is
not really a mobile show that's gonna
happen two months from now that's really
the issue I I try not to be so picky
about CES because this is really the
whole banana not just mobile it's got
everything vehicles it's got TVs right
it's got everything and a lot of people
cover more than
mobile and then that's the reason why
I'm like okay there's a lot of
innovation probably not what we're
looking for
makes it a little difficult for us but
so far I like I like what I've seen in
the show and it's always interesting
when like people who do not make a
specifically mobile product would like
you to cover their product because it
has a mobile element and sometimes
that's too much of a stretch but
sometimes it's really really cool like
just outside of our frame we have a how
do you pronounce it sous-vide I a
sous-vide by Innova yes and I was you
didn't it's not our meat so I was
ignoring it until someone started
shouting me shouting at me from it yeah
and I realized it was my my first
employer the very first person to give
me money for professional voice-over
work that it hired me in 2005 are you
serious okay to go are you serious small
world so this is why she has it's cool
do this it's like well you said it it's
small world and it that's exactly what
it is I mean a lot of us here have it
gets Nicole from mobile geeks one of our
good friends called it a solitary
existence where we we kind of work for
what we work for but it usually is just
our own existence then we gets it hang
out with our friends you know that's
what that's what shows like this or like
you know
Lunn you know your your this your first
CES and you know by the way on behalf of
everyone congratulations for coming and
you know if it was your dream you're
living it and I hope that has been
working out just fine for you but you
know yeah like you've been meeting all
of these people that you've only seen on
computer screens how is how is that
experience been for you man it's it's
kind of surreal in a way because I'm
like Michael Fisher's right here Jaime's
right here and I just fist bumped him
it's like any shorter than I I wasn't
expecting that it's it's just I don't
know it's almost kind of like I'm
starstruck in the way cuz I I watch
these guys and I look up to these guys
so it's just it's cool I like it like
even you I've told you before you know
like I I watched your videos before I
even was a part of Android authority so
for me to even be a part of the team
it's it's crazy for me you know cuz like
I just I mean you know the story of how
I applied for Android or 30 I just shot
off an email it just on a whim I didn't
think anything of it
you want to know something true story
yeah we all did the same we all did this
say we had nothing to lose
yeah that's that's pretty much how I
thought of it too so and you know it's
great and honestly you've been doing an
amazing job here and I've seen you guys
just work as well like like oh really I
said in the last video when we were with
DOM and Marco we're killing it out here
honestly we're killing it and CES is
Beth yeah and CES has been pretty good
to us now
speaking of CES is what I wanted to move
into now we already saw we would heard
from you on yesterday that the 4k TVs
from Sony are your favorite things so
far I want to ask you guys what's the
best thing you've seen so far I was
gonna say Jaime's answer is mine so
we're gonna steal each other's thing but
I'll say it the G flex 2 from LG I was a
big fan of the original G flex it is my
show phone now that the blackberry
classic has given up and oh how does
that happen I ran out of data on our
review SIM card which is fine that was a
great network us mobile but also I got
tired of using a platform that could not
support the kind of traffic we needed to
send yeah but you know what I will have
more thoughts on it later I don't want
to take up the floor talking about it
but then I've got the Lumia 1020 but I
use the G flex because it lasts so long
and because it has a lot of wonderful
features that I that help me out at CES
and the G flex 2 is nothing but a honing
and a reinforcement of everything good
about this and a reduction of everything
that was really kind of underwhelming
quick thaw quick bog flatten the G flex
2 and it's a one plus one except with a
dragon a 10 and a sell you accept the
invitation system
oh we don't and everything well I've
meant design-wise okay you notice the
top and bottom that's what I'm saying
no totally totally totally there are
some keen similarities between the two
hi Mei how about you men G flex 2 you
know I wish I would have seen it's not
because it's the only flagship that got
launched at this event it's not because
of that I've been an LG fan since the g2
I mean forget about the design and the
UI the battery life it's like it's
relaxed and I feel the didn't defy
anything like the g2 did too big honest
that's high praise it's terrific
it's futuristic its well-designed and
they focus on the things that matter
they didn't go for 2k displays do you
really even care about that
can you really notice the difference I
mean for me the over sharpening on the
g3 was a disappointment so for me for
the G flex 2 to be you know the
essentials a good display good battery
life hopefully we have to test that
we'll see it's a smaller battery
ergonomics hopefully durability
hopefully we have to test all these
things your drop test
that's that's that's what's gonna play
it all I'm looking forward to watching
your drop test and if we do do that like
it's been it hasn't been something that
we've done for a little while but I want
to be surprised if we did for that
honestly perverse coming from the guy
who put the G flex in a bag and start
shaking the crap out of it I didn't like
it I knew I was forced to do and you
think I like dropping phones yeah well
yeah we're in total agreement here I do
believe that the G flex 2 is probably
best in show or at least a top five at
the most but you know honestly um
ergonomics I think is already kind of
the jury is not even out for that I
think it's a great feeling phone off and
yeah the curved display is the only
thing that I think eyesight from like a
2k screen that actually proves itself to
the usage of the user a 2k screen you
can't really prove that that's actually
really useful to somebody yeah so that's
the thing blonde your your 4k bravia
czar though still your answer for for
the thing yeah that's that's still my
answer cuz I saw him again today and
it's just they're so freakin sweet I
mean you gotta see how even if none of
us combined can't afford him I don't
care if I can't afford him but I'm just
gonna enjoy them while they're right
here I mean they're so thin it's crazy
it's crazy how thin they are I mean I
mean Sony that Sony even made that a
point when they said it's thinner than
the Xperia smartphones but it's thinner
than a lot of smart phones yeah like I I
held up or I had Kevin hold up his
experience to it and it's it and I even
had one of the Sony guys there he said
is 4.9 inch or four point nine
centimeters or millimeters thin so it's
crazy yeah
I didn't have a chance to look at them
and it's just technology as we coming in
because inconspicuous conspicuous sorry
too much one inconspicuous and I like
that I like the fact that it's becoming
invisible and that that's really the
point you don't really look at a wall
anymore it's it's your flat-screen TV
right there you're actually enjoying
your experience that's really what
you're looking for you don't really like
you sure we come from the geek days
where we like gadgets but we like the
fact that they're becoming less and less
predominant and it's all about the
experience not necessarily about what's
providing it so I'm not running not like
last night where I was running out of
space on the card we I have plenty of
space on here well maybe so but I did
want to say this we're gonna what I was
gonna say was our viewers are not
complaining at all we got Andrew thorn
and PocketNow in the same video come on
now but with that in mind with with with
uh with in mind that we do have a little
bit of time left here people are kind of
rolling out just a little bit biggest
disappointment so far I see yes I'm
really looking forward to I'm gonna hand
the mic to you and you guys just have
fun I was I was slated to see I'm not
gonna say the brand name because I'm
gonna trash him but I was slated to see
a wearable that was going to sort of
redefine my perception really solid
wearable I'm not gonna do it and you
know he was much smaller than a
SmartWatch it was arguably more useful
in certain situations and it may well be
all those things have to be frank we
were promised a working prototype and I
went all across Las Vegas to find not
really I went a quarter of the way
across Las Vegas in rush-hour traffic
anyway I left this place to go to a
different place you know this trip is on
yeah man I've traveled a great long ways
to find to find a block of resin that
was non-functional it was a mock-up unit
that was a big big frustration because
this could have been a really cool thing
and so that was a disappointment for me
I'm not ready to say what the the
finished product isn't waiting yet to
see we're gonna look at but maybe Jaime
has an idea of what that might be for us
I don't know I don't know I it's hard
for me to declare a disappointment there
are so many again the good the cool
thing about CES is there's a lot of
innovation behind it there's a lot of
purpose for it some of the products here
are vapor where they will never reach
the market we we know that for the
longest time but then again I guess
companies like for example Samsung I was
expecting for a company that's making a
comeback it's trying to make a comeback
good point to at least bring something
to this show you know this show this is
the market that makes Samsung what it is
and yet we got MIT tiered and lower
tiered phones but then again again the
problem is CES is more than just about
bones they do TVs they do everything so
probably it's because of our scope but
they disappoint me not necessarily
exactly exactly I MWC that's gonna be
the show that's gonna be the show indeed
Ilana I don't remember what your answer
was last night oh no you weren't there
that's right what is your biggest
disappointment of CES so far I'm gonna
have to because I think you mentioned it
in one of our recap videos I'm gonna
have to go with Nvidia just just because
I read the the chip it's it's awesome
we know it's it's a powerful chip and
text yeah yeah on paper but like
historically we haven't seen like Nvidia
chips in a ton of devices like it be one
or two and then it's just for a reason
the Tegra 3 was such a disappointment I
feel OMS became skeptical about yeah
that's that's that's true I suppose but
I don't know it's just I want to see
their chips and more products and and
then the whole thing with the parking
the autonomous car it's just the way
they presented it like you said it just
wasn't presented in a in a fashion that
everybody that got everybody excited
about it so I would say that that's
probably my biggest letdown for me it
was the same thing it was in video
because I was there to you my for the
first ever event I did for in Viet Feroz
for Android thority press conference
that is was in video two years ago when
Jenson Huang accidentally called shield
project Thor and it was hilarious and
but the thing is after that it turned
out to be an amazing press conference
and the shield was an amazing product
I'm a big fan of shield tablet by the
way I'm sure our viewers know but the
yeah the the thing is this time around
automotive technology which is the which
is kind of the story of CES in certain
ways
it's been the focus they they presented
it in a way that honestly it almost put
us to sleep it really did you know don't
get me wrong there are plenty of people
in that press conference that we're
right there with them they knew what
teraflops meant for example and um but
the rest of us who are here for
different focuses the Tegra x1 was a
great announcement we were expecting to
hear something like oh look how fast
this tablet goes the x1 will change the
game and then they put it in a car and
then they showed us four videos over and
over again of a car parking on its own
and it and and that car took like two
miles an hour it took so hot it took so
long for it to park it wasn't
necessarily the release that was bad it
was just the way it was presented but
I'm about to say actually I was about to
sign off the yeah we've definitely put a
bit of a longer video there but I'm sure
a lot of you guys don't mind because we
have a great group of people over here
we've actually been been buddies for a
little while so it's it's great for us
to finally get a video together that is
even at this length no one cares
you guys love it I know you know we got
we do we do too so and thank you thank

know we'll see you on the podcast this
