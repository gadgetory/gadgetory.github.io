buy a Samsung Galaxy s4 what if you're
not sure we've got a couple reasons why
you might not want to buy one hey
everybody I'm Chris look now just ask
anybody who's disappointed in Windows 8
and they'll be happy to tell you that
the new thing isn't necessarily always
the best thing did that end we've got
five reasons why you might want to hold
off on picking up that s4 let's get
started with number one yes it's true
that the galaxy s4 has some of the
fastest Hardware currently available but
we're quickly reaching a point where
those sorts of improvements are barely
noticeable not to mention with all the
new software it's not exactly a huge
step up in terms of raw performance it's
the same case with the design samsung
has been criticised recently for a lot
of their devices looking very much the
same and it's hard to disagree with that
a lot of people like some variety then
that brings us to number two Samsung
isn't the only manufacturer around and
remember the s4 isn't the only device
they're selling you might prefer an HTC
One or a Sony Xperia Z or the crowd
favorite the galaxy note 2 or countless
others and they're all going to bring
something different to the table if
you're happy with what you've got
why upgrade and if you're on the lookout
for a new phone make sure it's got the
features that matter to you
speaking of which you might not find
yourself using many of the features on
the galaxy s4 for example no matter
which way I use smart scroll when I do
get it to work I noticed that my eyes
start to hurt fairly quickly then you
have smart paws which I guess might have
sounded like a good idea on paper here's
the thing you never notice how often you
look away from videos until your phone
stops playing them every time you do now
even if you do want to use some of the
new features on the s4 it's worth
keeping in mind that we might see them
on the note 2 or the s3 eventually think
back to the note 2 and multi-window
yeah it was exclusive for a while but
once all the fanfare had died down s3
owners did get their hands on it now
Samsung isn't stupid
so yeah they'll probably keep these
features exclusive to the s4
while they can but sooner or later you
can probably bet that we'll see at least
some of them on older devices now our
final item is something that a bunch of
you have been screaming at us about the
Galaxy Note 3 we already know that the
hardware is going to be a step up plus
it's just big looking back at the jump
from the s3 to the note 2 it's hard not
to get excited about what's coming up
and that is just the tip of the iceberg
when you combine the note 3 with what's
likely in-store from other manufacturers
it starts to look like a better and
better idea to hold on to your trusty
older phone until we know what exactly
is coming down the pipeline so you've
heard what we think now it's your tone
are you going to hang on to your old
phone and wait for something else or are
you gonna upgrade to the s4 or have you
already we'd love to hear what you think
