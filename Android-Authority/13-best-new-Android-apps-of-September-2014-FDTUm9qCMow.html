Hindy the android authority app guy it's
October and I know I'm a little bit late
on this video that's my bad but we are
going to round up the best applications
from September of 2014 first up this
month is angry birds Stella yes I know
Angry Birds isn't the world's most
favorite franchise anymore but the game
is still fairly decent there are over a
hundred and twenty levels it's bright
and colorful and it's great to keep your
kids busy on that long car ride it's
free to play with in-app purchases and
that makes it a good deal even if it is
another angry birds game beach buggy
racing is the latest racing game out of
vector unit and it's pretty good it's a
light-hearted cart style racing game
where you can pick up power-ups race
through a bunch of tracks and do other
race like things it's free to play with
in-app purchases and vector unit usually
does really good with their games so
this is definitely worth checking out
complete air trainer is a music
application that teaches musicians how
to listen to music and know what notes
are being played it's fairly
comprehensive and it works a lot like a
reference guide mixed with a video game
the design is top notch and it really is
one of the best instructional music apps
that we have ever seen you can demo the
application for free and the full thing
costs 299 the Dragon Quest was
originally released by Squaresoft back
when it was still called squaresoft all
the way back in nineteen eighty six fans
of retro games and fans of JRPGs should
have a good time with this one it has
remastered artwork and the controls have
been updated for mobile it's also fairly
cheap for a square enix game because it
only costs 299 fifa15 was released
earlier this month it's an upgrade to
the insanely popular fifa 14 it comes
with improved graphics more players and
more teams it's free to play with in-app
purchases much like the prior title the
gameplay is pretty much as good as
you're going to get for a mobile sports
game and outside of some early server
issues people seem to be really enjoying
it the Lynx browser is a new application
that is in beta right now if you've ever
used or heard of link bubble you
essentially know how this application
works you click on links and they open
in little bubbles and you can do
whatever you want and come back to the
bubble to view the link later it's
currently totally free which is a good
price but it is in beta so beware of the
bugs if you're looking for something
truly stable you'll probably want to
stick with link bubble for right now
the goat simulator was released earlier
this month to positive reviews in this
game you slain slide and otherwise goof
around as a goat as you simulate it's
real life it's a hilarious game where
the developers actually keep bugs around
if they're funny enough but they're
still fixing the ones that make the game
crash you can be a goat and there's
nothing wrong with that hangouts Tyler
reminds us that earlier this month your
hangouts application can now make phone
calls and that google voice was
integrated into it the app is actually
fairly useless because it just opens up
the dialer section of Google Hangouts
even so it's a nice little shortcut to
the new feature that you can use instead
of your regular phone dialer app if you
so choose horizon is a camera
application that always shoots in
horizontal mode even if you're holding
your phone in portrait mode this is
great because vertical videos have
always been terrible and this
application keeps that from happening
it's pretty unique and it uses the
gyroscope of the device to keep your
shot level even as your phone turns it's
free with in-app purchases so why not
give it a shot month is a calendar
widget application that allows you to
create you guessed it's calendar widgets
its claim to fame as its massive theme
selection the free version doesn't come
with all that many themes or you can buy
more at your leisure as in-app purchases
similar to swiftkey this widgets look
really nice and you can find a theme to
match yours most of the time the actual
calendar app is a little minimal but it
gets the job done this is great for
casual users but hardcore calendar users
may want to find something more
feature-rich if you like clash of clans
but wished it had more star wars in it
then star wars commander is for you it's
a lot of the same stuff you build a base
with walls and defenses and then you
defend against attacks and launch
attacks of your own there are a few
unique game features here that you don't
get in clash of plans it's free and it's
Star Wars and that means it's worth
checking out topeka is a new quiz game
that came out this last month as a quiz
game it's pretty average but the real
story here is the design it was released
by Chrome apps for mobile and it's
actually an HTML game that's been
converted for Android and uses the
latest material design it's pretty fun
and it looks really good so why not
check it out watch over me as our last
item this month and it's pretty useful
this is a GPS application that will
alert your loved ones if you don't do
something at a certain time let's say
you go for a run and you tell the
application that you'll be back in 30
min
if you don't disarm the application in
30 minutes the app sends your last known
GPS coordinates to your emergency
contact and lets them know that you
didn't check in this is great for anyone
who lives in a bad neighborhood or
anyone who has health issues once again
