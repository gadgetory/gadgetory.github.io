s8 display burn-in should you be worried
the galaxy s 8 and s 8 plus displays
have come under fire a couple times
since their release once because of an
issue with red color bias and another
time
with regards to burn in problems when
this occurs an outline of the image can
remain burnt into the screen even after
the screen has been turned off or
replaced with a different picture it's
an issue which can be found in almost
all displays though modern technology
has gone some way to reducing it now
when one of its support pages samsung
says that you shouldn't have a static
image on a display when it comes to LED
displays for more than two hours but
this was in relation to LED TVs so it's
not exactly a light for light comparison
but for simplicity sake let's say that
this also applies to smartphone displays
in the case of the galaxy s 8 the device
makes use of an always-on display which
means certain portions of the screen
remain illuminated even when the device
is locked this includes the phone's
clock and its software home button
although the always-on display can be
switched off or scheduled to switch off
at a certain time it's possible that it
could remain present on screen for
several hours
so if LED burn occurs when static images
on AMOLED screens are displayed over
extended periods of time the s8 and si+
displays must be particularly
susceptible to this issue correct no not
exactly the Samsung Galaxy s8 shouldn't
experience burnin problems from the
always-on home button because it's
designed to move very subtly so it's not
an aesthetic position for too long this
was recently corroborated with the
Galaxy club fan site now this is a
common trick to avoid burnin the Galaxy
S a clock also moves and Samsung
released an update for the galaxy s7
always-on display so that its contents
could shuffle in small increments also
while reports that burnin has affected
the s8 display suggests this doesn't
work it's also possible that it does
work on millions of other devices out
there and that's the couple or so
devices that were affected are rare
exception
now please notice I said possible it's
too early to tell but we will keep
monitoring that you also want to
remember that always-on display is not
exactly always on the home button is
part of the always-on display but it's
not actually always on it switches off
when you enter certain apps and it is
even temporarily removed when you hit
the unlock screen even if you happen to
be doing something that regular requires
a lot of on screen time like reading an
e-book or watching Netflix the
navigation bar where the home button is
situated gets turned off
thus the times when a smartphone screen
would happen to produce a static image
for extended periods think hours are
pretty uncommon and you have to try to
do it really try so I want to know have
any of you new s8 or si plus users
experienced burnin on your screens have
you had any problem please let me know
on the Twitterverse or in the comments
