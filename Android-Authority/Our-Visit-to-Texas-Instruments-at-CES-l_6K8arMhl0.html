there are a few things I did not say so
recognizes you have a specific software
yeah this is a and basically recognized
you as a male or female different
agendas and then it hits the art which
is relevant for that particular thing so
maybe if you just walk in here that from
your health care town the demo in front
of the camera ah she's just no no just
use this one we are gonna be this year's
now okay don't forget to smile yeah
there are multiple people so here and
there it is like different difference is
switching back and forth like this okay
then
and I was when I sauces yeah and then
there's multiple people then it shows
like the family one oh yeah this is the
one that I saw this way of singing
Tommy's notice stuff I'm just looking at
ryerson study
on this device so just devices it has
created a Wi-Fi yeah a hot spot if you
will I made sure I'm connected to it
then I came out and there's a app
they're called bubble upnp went in there
it gives me my library of different
videos and I'm currently playing this
one so now i just clicked on it so it's
gonna restart that video very very cool
so is it possible actually feel the home
screen you to use a nap would you can't
we be able to do it I was so good just
for video playing it's just for video
playing so right now that's what the app
is the app is only allowing us to play
stuff that's whether it's a video or
some kind of presentation if it's a
slideshow photos and so forth that's
okay I mean this is probably the most
common use case scenario you know I
think being elves access you know maybe
a calendar
especially yeah being able to mirror the
device is is evolving I think we're able
to do that over cables right now several
different accessory products this one is
the first of its kind that's actually
streaming a playing content over Wi-Fi
at the picture actually and that this
product is self you'd mentioned
resolution is a prequel by 8 55 x 480 so
854 x 480 x 9 ratio and the best way to
think about it is it's equivalent to DVD
quality so growing up your DVD quality
image that's why you're getting on this
message 30 minutes yeah it's roughly 35
wounded Republicans and around two hours
battery life or so get up to two hours
and all this to that contains GOP
technology inside it contains dlp pico
by Texas Instruments that's right yeah
so you can probably expect to see more
things of this nature in the future
that's exactly right so this one should
be launched sometime in the first
quarter okay it should be in a retail
price summer under two hundred dollars
wow that's great and we'll definitely
start saying more of this type of
product in the next year how much
progress have you made I know it
requires really deep integration to be
able to project you home screen you know
that is how much progress will be made
you know mirroring that so display our
customers are making a lot of progress
on a regular basis on that so especially
if you look at for example the iphone
sleeves they're out you see multiple
brands that have those today those are
all mirroring the yes the image there
are several companies looking at doing
the same with the iphone 5 yeah there's
also what your what you'll find is
companies are starting to now look at
doing the same with Android so we're
seeing a lot of traction with products
that are going to come out in the near
future that are going to attach to
Android and it's going to mirror the
image very good whether it's Wi-Fi or
connected when you're when you're
slipping on the case yeah the key is
making it seamless and we think if it's
a case that you were going to use any
ways to come to to protect your phone
then you should be able to put a little
better in there for some extra do
something exactly feel like you've done
that with the iphone I'm sorry that's
right he takes exactly right the fact
had mentioned something that was really
exciting and said that you've been able
to reduce the footprint of the DLP chip
itself that's right and be able to pack
more pixels into that's right
google has a lower power envelope that's
right so can you speak with that little
bit yeah sure so we just announced what
Monday our latest pixel new pixel
architecture we're already working with
manufacturers on it reduces our power
significantly so that customers can get
to a much higher battery life with
higher lumens so it also has a an
architecture or design if you will as
far as the tilt and roll nature of the
whale the way that the mirrors turn on
and off is is designed in such a way
that you can get more efficient light
coming and getting onto the screen so on
top of that we made the architecture
smaller in such a way that you can up to
double get up to double the resolution
in the same equivalent package okay so
have the existing product like the
Samsung Galaxy Beam and that's a w
actually I know it's an FPGA it's an HD
for that way nature 640 x 360 640 so for
example as an example with that product
you're getting somewhere in the 200,000
pixel rings yeah so you'd be able to
theoretically get up to four hundred
thousand pixels or more on the same on
that same size package to be able to
pack in a lot more resolution in that
small mike jessica pare brady's
theoretically that would be able to do
720p then drew realized 720p for his
double theoretically a theoretically
theoretically so we're working with our
customers on getting these this new
pixel architecture into their next-gen
products today I think that the earliest
will see some products by the ends of
this year but it has some new pics
architecture in it
and on top of all that obviously our
customers are already working on ways
they can get more efficient outside of
our chipset yes I think with all of the
evolution of the ability of our
customers to innovate around the chipset
and the new pixel architecture you'll
see some some pretty groundbreaking type
of products it's really exciting stuff
and obviously things are just going to
keep on going maybe 10 years from now
we'll have definitely and you'll hear
will hear more about the new pixel
architecture I think as the year goes on
so kind of product what does have the
actual miniaturization and everything
you guys are doing everything on your
end to you know make these better
brighter consume less power but we're
seeing of sort of a roadblock in terms
of you know the evolution of battery
life battery technology itself hasn't
really caught up you know with the rest
of the industry can you speak to that a
little bit like a are you expecting any
sort of breakthroughs in battery
technology in the near future so that we
can get five six seven eight hours so
we're working with all of our customers
to make sure that the battery
capabilities that they're getting is the
best possible technology that all of the
the key brands and the key manufacturers
are using already today and tablets and
cell phones etc because we know they're
going to be using the most advanced
battery so working with them is to make
sure that the batteries that we're using
side of projectors the side of our
products that have pico technology
inside will have the best possible now
whether we think there's gonna be a
breakthrough or not I think that's up to
those manufacturers and those those
customers figure that out
well I think that but wraps it up fellas
thank you very much for your time again
so I really appreciate it ok</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
