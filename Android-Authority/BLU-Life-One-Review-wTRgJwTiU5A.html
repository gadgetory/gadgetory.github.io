available for under $200 which support
4G LTE networks within the US blue is
aiming to change that though with the
redesigned Life One series so is the
life one a good option for those wanting
the fastest speeds available on a tight
budget this is Bailey Stein with Android
authority and this is my for review of
the Blu life one the Blu life one is
available in two variants one with the
5-inch display and another with a larger
5.5 inch display this is the review for
the five inch model although the one XL
Edition shares the same specifications
except with a larger display larger
battery and slightly thicker profile the
phone is available in a few different
color options each with a sandstone
finish and metal side housing in the
hand the life one is both thin and light
at 7.5 millimeters and 125 grams put
simply the life one that only feels
great but also looks great the rear
cover can be removed to access a micro
SIM slot or a micro SD nano SIM slot you
can't use a micro SD card and a nano SIM
card in this same slot unfortunately but
the option for expandable storage up to
64 gigabytes is one that cannot be
overlooked the 24 20 milliamp battery is
sadly not user replaceable the power and
volume buttons which are on the right
side of the phone have excellent tactile
feedback there is a considerable amount
of bezel on the front of the device
although I did appreciate the same
sandstone finish being used for their
display frame in addition to the blue
branding above the display there is a 5
megapixel front facing camera to the
right of the earpiece and a notification
LED to the left the life one's 5 inch
720p display looks nice with good
viewing angles it can be difficult to
see under direct sunlight however and
there is a noticeable amount of
backlight bleeding the display is coated
in Corning Gorilla Glass 3 but if you're
still worried about scratching the
display you can always apply the
included screen protector powered by the
quad-core Snapdragon 410 64-bit
processor clocked at 1.2 gigahertz the
life--one does seem a bit sluggish at
time
it's definitely an improvement over the
400 but the phone still suffers from
occasional scrolling stutters the one
gigabyte of ram isn't enough for using
more than a few apps at once and I'm
worried about how the phone will handle
the more memory hungry Android 5.0
lollipop the Adreno 306 GPU is enough to
play most games but you shouldn't be
surprised to see drop frames and slow
load times and some higher-end games the
life one does include the usual GPS 802
11 and Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0 it also
supports 4G LTE on AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile in
addition to fully supporting HSPA+ on
both networks the rear speaker is pretty
loud although it does sound a bit
distorted I really would have liked to
see front-facing speakers but I really
can't complain considering the phones
price
the 13 megapixel Sony IMAX 135 rear
camera produced mostly good-looking
shots images taken outdoor and broad
daylight looked pretty good and color
reproduction is pretty accurate it did
have some minor exposure issues but I
think the camera is pretty good overall
the camera app provides quite a bit of
control
with options to change white balance ISO
exposure contrast saturation and
sharpness as expected battery life on
the life one is pretty good despite the
battery capacity of 20 420 milliamps the
Snapdragon 410 is one of the most power
efficient processors available
and users shouldn't have any problems
getting the phone to last through a full
day of use during my battery life test I
started my day around for him and the
battery lasted until about 6:40 p.m.
with nearly two hours of screen on time
that day was with pretty heavy usage
however as I use tethering for about an
hour and GPS for about 30 minutes in
addition to that I was using both the
AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile networks for the
majority of the day the Blu life one
ships with Android 4.4.4 kitkat but will
be upgraded to Android 5.0 lollipop in
July I'm quite honestly not a fan of the
included launcher nor the custom icons
but that's about where the software
customization ends there are some weird
setting icons as well as the default
opera web browser but the phone software
otherwise suits those wanting a stock
experience one thing that I did want to
note is that you actually can't change
the lockscreen wallpaper I tried
changing it directly through the default
launcher and the Google now launcher but
there is no option to change both the
homescreen and the lock screen just the
homescreen I figured that the setting
was just buried but changing it through
wallpaper under display and the Settings
app also did not yield any results the
blue life one is available with 8
gigabytes of storage starting today
June 10th for a hundred and forty nine
dollars on Amazon Blue is offering
special pricing during the first week
however making this phone $99 make sure
you order during the first week if you
want to take advantage of that discount
overall the Blu life one is an excellent
phone
for the price it has a beautiful design
good camera and great battery life on
the other hand the display is of a lower
resolution the performance could have
been better and the preinstalled a flan
sure is a departure from stock android
for 149 dollars though the blue Leghorn
is a good value with 4G LTE support an
even better value at $99 if you're
looking for a good ultra cheap smart
phone the Blu life one will not
disappoint thank you for watching this
