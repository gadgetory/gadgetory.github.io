brought to you by domain.com so you're
lusting after the galaxy note5 well we
got leaks on the king of phablets so
remember guys these are rumors these are
leaks so take it with a pinch of salt
here we go k supplier mobile Direct has
obtained pictures of new cases allegedly
for the galaxy note 5 while the case is
a transparent TPU product the design
itself meshes with the images leaked
last week well this is hardly
confirmation of anything it begins to
look more apparent that the note 5 will
follow in the footsteps of the s6 and
make use of the side-by-side camera
biometric sensor set up as opposed to
the above and below arrangement seen in
last year's flagships courtesy of the
friends over at nowhere else we have
what are allegedly the first pictures of
the galaxy note5 now suffice it to say
some people are going to be very happy
the render here looks oddly reminiscent
to those like we saw in the first days
of the launch of the galaxy s6 now
forbes has extrapolated that this is
indicative of a glass back thus a
unibody design attention must be paid
however to the cut out for the s pen and
the headphone jack both of which looks
slightly peculiar now this could be an
early render it could be based on
expectations or it could be totally
false in truth this development isn't
exactly a surprise for samsung given its
clear focus on refining the design and
recreating the very idea of what its
flagship products are now I expect the
whole unibody design is going to upset
many of you chances are high that many
customers will be outraged by the
unibody design as the note series has
always been about business productivity
with heavy usage being offset by
removable battery and on-the-go
plug-and-play type file access being
facilitated by the presence of microsd
support as for the battery issue however
while forbes has imagined a scenario
where the product could theoretically
contain a removable glass rear this
seems extremely unlikely also unlikely
any hope of the device making use of a
USB type-c something that has been
rumored for some time along with a 4k
screen and other lofty desires now there
is nothing technically stopping samsung
from including microsd support for the
note 5
as it would require a little more than a
separate tray like the HTC One m9 or
even a double sized single tray allowed
the dual SIM variants of the s6 indeed
an alleged conversation with a Samsung
representative made reference to a
specific decision to remove said feature
to make its product more comparable to
those of its competitors in terms of
design storage options and quote core
functionality now that's just double
speak for we all want to be more like
the iPhone 6 plus and if you look at our
opinion poll here you'll see geeks like
options we want our microsd support and
removable battery but sadly geeks are
not mainstream so we pay the price for
it and the winner of our t-shirt contest
is will the boxer who came up with
Android diction calm hmm i love it when
someone can come up with a clever calm
why because no domain name extension
