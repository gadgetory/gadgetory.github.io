original android hangout show on google+
this is episode 52 and I'm dare across
one Scott Anderson I'm Dan Charleston
I'm Johnathan Franklin and we are joined
by android authority guest this week
Christopher whoop AKA wookie and nate

keep listening keep watching and we'll
give you that special secret URL in a
little bit so this week of a few big
topics to talk about right now all the
rage today is Chromebook pixel so we're
going to hit that up and then we're
going to talk about ubuntu touch because
at well that's pretty pretty darn
popular today too earlier in the week
HTC one
announced an android authority was at
the event our own Christopher walk was
there he's gonna talk all about that let
us know how awesome are all awesome the
device is not we're going to talk about
some dashclock stuff because that app is
hot i love that act and then dan is
going to do with dan does best and he's
going to talk about processors because
dan knows about processors he's a
retired colonel developer all right so
Scott let's get started let's talk about
some Chromebook pixel stuff alright so
Chromebook pixel on and kind of the next
generation of Chrome OS and new hardware
announced today the Wi-Fi only version
is 1200 ninety nine dollars and the one
with LTE for Verizon Wireless is
fourteen hundred forty nine dollars so
ain't no cheap Fang that you know and
that's different from most Chromebooks
are a thousand dollars cheaper yeah it
is such a huge jump that uh kind of took
people by surprise I didn't know that
they were gonna go this high I don't
think any of you did either I mean I
thought they were going to continue and
just kind of increase the hardware but
huge jump uh but we'll get on to why it
costs that much and I can get you some
bank to the bunk let's backtrack a
little bit and talk about the initial
rumors if you remember android authority
covered the rumor a few weeks back
whenever a video showed up on youtube
and then was mysteriously taken down
while we we and a bunch of other people
stole it before was uh you know what
nothing disappears on the internet right
so so we were able to capture it before
it was taken down and then we had some
things posted on google+ saying hey
sorry we were hacked by a company nobody
really ever heard of and then we had a
Vincent coke I believe his name is uh
come out of the woodwork saying hey my
company slinky got me was hacked we are
working on this video and everybody says
no this is real know that I'm sorry no
this isn't real there's a lot of people
looking at saying you know what if you
look at the company look at the guy you
look at their profile that this company
didn't do this this thing's fake that
the product isn't real and many major
tech blogs the debunked it and then many
major tech blogs such as ourselves we
backed and we said yeah it's real and he
and here's the fact who started going
over factor of fact and then lo and
behold today we find out it's real and
our own nate swanner he actually
interviewed the the guy that's kind of
infamous for leaking the Chromebook
pixel before and after it was officially
announced Nate you want to talk about
that for a given to the specs here in
doing you know in doing research for our
initial stories I reached out to him I
didn't get an answer we ran a story
which was just kind of a is it real is
he real what's going on this guy's
really there's not a lot of information
about him especially for a guy who's you
know supposed to be an ex-googler and
all that kind of stuff there was just no
information readily available about him
so I wrote the story he reached out
afterwards we got to talking and he
never really confirmed or denied it that
that was the Chromebook pixel that that
was the actual product that he you know
physical product he had seen so he never
he was really evasive still and then
today happen and he kind of he then he
wrote me on google talk with a kind of
haha told you so so so we got to talking
a little bit he's in japan now he wasn't
china trying to solve his hacker issue
he you know just kind of want to touch
base and say hi and i told you so and he
kind of hinted it some you some a few
more surprises for i/o we talked about
that because obviously if the Chromebook
sound now it may not be at i/o like we
thought it would so he hinted at a few
more surprises um again there's not a
lot of information but he was right
about the pixels so it's kind of hard to
doubt him yeah yeah I'm curious to find
out maybe in the next coming weeks you
know what what other hints he's given us
you know yeah me too oh hopefully I'll
get more I definitely will keep us
posted on that neat so Scott let's talk
about some specs why is this thing cost
1400 bucks ah 12.8 5-inch screen it's a
400 nits display also the brightness is
good it has a resolution of
2005a 2560 x 1700 239 ppi it has Gorilla
Glass multi-touch screen 32 or 64
gigabyte storage back leg so let's hold
on saying let's let's talk about that
screen you know there's besides windows
8 tablets can you name another tablet
that has a touchscreen on it that's
popular or that is produced by a company
that everybody is going to know by name
no there-there's nothing major out there
that there are tablets do exist touch
screens with windows 8 but community ops
yeah what did I say tablets you have a
laptop on your tablets that are popular
the people yea i meant I meant laptops
yeah so there's nothing besides you know
the new ones are coming out windows 8
that like a name off all those popular
co exactly they're not popular um and
this thing has an amazing screen I mean
it's it's the highest resolution screen
to date on any notebook computer that
that's huge its bits or tablet or tablet
I think and the back on that back I
couldn't have screen career oh it's a
three by two aspect ratio you know
Google said you know that I know we kind
of looked at uh aspect ratios of tablets
and the movie industry really pushed to
said tablets again the movie industry
really pushed you know notebook
computers into being sixteen by nine or
16 x 10 because that's what movies are
but does it need to be widescreen like
that and google says no apparently so we
have a three by two aspect ratio retina
I hate saying right but let's say
awesome display if you buy two awesome
display tablet or damn it every time i
say tablet somebody needs to someone
needs to craig no dare cross mean good
oh no not in on it goes away so elbow
more hardware so eight HD webcam you
were you were getting ready
I think uh yeah also a backlit chrome
keyboard all of that ishy webcam is the
720p it has two USB 2.0 ports which I
don't know why it doesn't have a three
it says yeah exactly so something that
costs thirteen or fourteen hundred
dollars it doesn't have USB 3 that's
weird I'm sorry that West that's we want
USB 3 point what's that Dan just chrome
OS support USB 3 point up the fact that
I'm guessing that's the Hangout could be
until Chrome OS needs to support it if
that is that it's based on basically a
hybrid of ubuntu in a couple other
distros it should support it technically
say well i wouldn't either way it
doesn't support it and that's kind of
interesting but it also has a mini
displayport two and one card reader
supporting SD and MMC and it has an
intel i5 processor dual core 1.8 your
hurts now this that's interested jump
from what we've had in the past so such
as we learn such as this samsung phone
book yeah so people are gonna like this
will be a whole new experience for a
Chromebook because if the validating day
with the speed because mine you know I
you know it's cheap and I just use it
for you know just random browsing and
checking stuff but this has a lot more
juice which will be interesting to see
and figure out people's reactions to
that as an intel HD graphics card 4000
series and has four gigabytes of ddr3
RAM a lot of RAM which is which is more
than other Chromebooks have no W not
Iran that the other Chromebooks have
well you know chrome the browser in
general is a ram hog as we know yeah um
and then it has a five hour battery
which that's short you know that's not
that bad considering look look at the
display and the Samsung arm
a 16 hour battery I believe yeah you
look at the Ace or it's actually two and
a half or three on your person a lot of
pixels you talk about a core i5 versus
sentry nose and yeah yeah that's up look
at hp's laptop that just came out the HP
Chromebook it only has two and a half
hour battery it has a intel celeron four
hours on those a man they'll even have
anywhere near that that kind of display
on their battery though I think that
battery life is actually good for that
device oh I agree i disagree but looking
at what you're paying well is
twenty-five percent brighter than any
other high-end model 400 nits it's a
measuring of brightness and 3 by 2
aspect ratio and here's the kicker yet
one terabyte of google drive storage for
three years now take the price of the
coral book let's say thirteen hundred
dollars google drive storage if you
wanted to get right now you didn't want
to buy a chrome OS on notebook or
whatever it costs fifty dollars a month
and it would cost you eighteen hundred
dollars over that three years you mean
google drive if you right now to drive
yeah just right now wanted to purchase
google drive space it's 50 bucks a month
and over the course of three years
that's eighteen hundred dollar so if you
need a terabyte of google drive space by
a chromebook pixel and save five hundred
dollars that right there makes it worth
buying I mean I wanted to balk at the
price and we'll get to that in a second
but if i needed a terabyte of cloud
storage to store all my movies are all
or something whatever whatever i want to
store I mean a terabyte of space is
going to cost you over three years
eighteen hundred bucks I don't five
hundred dollars if I bought a Chromebook
pixel yep now I I think you're looking
at those more personal use I don't think
it it's going to be a whole bunch
personal using Google's targeting
businesses and stuff but we'll get to
that yeah so what you guys think those
bex do they live up to the price and is
the kind of the carrot on top the one
terabyte for three years worth it oh
I'll go first then we'll go down the
line here i guess and give our first
initial thoughts on this so when I saw
the initial Chromebook pixel video I
thought wow this thing is awesome that
if this is true it's going to you know
all the pixels all that is the the power
the display that this thing is going to
be more expensive than a regular
Chromebook I thought to myself you know
the nexus 10 you know at 350 400 doll or
tablet has a lot of pixels more than any
other tablet let's just double the price
of that for a little bit more bang for
your buck a little bit more juice and
that's that's probable it'll cost that's
what I was thinking so I was thinking
you know 700 bucks 800 bucks I wasn't
thinking a thousand let alone 1300 and
that just I'm not buying one because of
that because I can't afford to spend
1,300 bucks I don't need a Chromebook I
have one i have a samsung arm for it to
be an impulse buy arranged to me we'd
have to cut that in half so people that
are looking for new laptops maybe uh
impulse buying I don't think so unless
you're somebody is in this hangout
already bought one um that's just my
thought now in terms of hardware that's
awesome uh I mean it has a powerful
processor to me this is competing
against the macbook pro that's similarly
priced and similarly expect um but a
macbook pro that has the same hardware
similar hardware can do a lot more than
a Chromebook and maybe I'm missing the
concept of a Chromebook raw but
initially i thought that chrome books
were cool because they were going to be
cheap and they're they're going to be
able to you know get make computing easy
and simple for the masses because
everybody can get a cheap computer and
get stuff
so everybody can get stuff done in a
really badass way now but it just it's
not cheap like previous Chromebooks and
it it's hard for me to fathom right now
because the previous Chromebooks have
been so cheap so I I don't know what to
think about it I I'm curious we'll talk
about a little bit later what is down
the road for the next Chromebook so dan
what are your thoughts on the on the
pixel one before that is one of the
person again Andrew darling says that it
will take all three years to upload
stuff to that and are you running like a
28.8 k modem what are you doing it's not
going to you know it's not a yeah I mean
I have a pretty fast internet here
through comcast I can net now comcast
does limit me at 250 gig a month so take
me four months to upload but hey after
four months I go I'm good and I'll
not've and you gotta download it again
every time you want to use it though
yeah you know but once y'all um I'm not
gonna stream it all over I'm not gonna
stream turn 50 gig a month that's a lot
you're still not limited on verizon to
see how they like oh yeah well yeah well
yeah what if you were what if you're
using verizon yeah yeah you transferred
via USB from your computer to your own
and then you upload it from your phone
before the show we're getting off track
here but I'm gonna continue there or not
dan said he was just gonna drive down to
Kansas City find a Wi-Fi hotspot you
know it's a google fiber and just upload
everything right there you know spread
on Google's back on me fast as crap how
we're gonna be limited by they have 15
that's unpossible upload all right so
anyway so what do you think about the
pixel man yeah I have to agree with you
about the price being a little
shockingly high mean the specs are
decent but not quite that good if it had
a gigabytes of RAM and I seven maybe
thirteen hundred dollars but I could get
a laptop with an i7 processor and a
gigabyte RAM for half the price so I
just I don't see it as being something
that I would buy foot I'll to think that
a big part of that is that I just don't
see Chrome OS is being mature enough to
justify that but again I think that's
kind of the
right I'm sorry Dan that was routed me
to laugh while you're talking but Chris
Rizzo that's watching this show right
now he named you already he decided to
to make that into a meme as I was
jokingly saying so uh if you're watching
the show and you to bed over the Google+
comments and look at the original post
and you'll see Chris Rizzo's mean he
made that made me laugh that's that's
good Thank You Fred yeah all right so
said John what do you think about the
pixel price was given that they've
really pushed OEMs you know with
everything else i honestly think if they
had put it in the eight to nine hundred
dollar price range i think that was
achievable yeah um the one i think the
one thing is really lacking with a lot
of windows laptop still has end up
getting better since the Ultrabook push
but there's really not really well built
and really well done all the way through
laptop you know existing for windows you
know most of them are still 1366 x 768
crap resolution and keyboards or you
know decent but not great the track pads
are kind of crappy too there's a market
for a really well-built computer you
know I look at am a macbook pro and I
hate mac OS x with a passion i could
never use mecos i heard word software
keep me away from it but i like the way
that their laptops are built can you
know what you do that you have something
there John because I know a lot of
people that that buy a macbook pro just
because the hardware is awesome and then
they put boot camp on it and run windows
or they or just well you know boot camp
in a bunt too or just blow away and do
straight about you know thus this the
first thing that came to mind when I saw
this was that the specs are you know did
reasonably fast it would be a pretty
good device to dual boot with ubuntu on
actually it would make a pretty decent
little thing to boot into linux whenever
you would need to and i'm not associated
maybe for the time being until Chrome OS
gets stronger that Google should make an
easier way to do that too if they're
going to get into the high-end you know
because if i pay over a thousand dollars
for a computer I expect that computer to
be able to do all of my computing needs
not just not just a supplementary device
to something where I'd still have to
have a desktop on occasion to do someone
so so here so here think about this
let's say Google wants you to keep this
device for three years because they're
giving you a terabyte of storage for
three years so think of where I know
you're not supposed to buy something in
hopes that it gets more awesome but
think of what's gonna happen over the
next couple years you know it's really
good and then hardware three year old
hardware is not ancient like it used to
be either you know I mean you have a
five year old computer now it's still
usable all right so wookie moving on
here what do you think about the pic so
what are your initial thoughts I'm
basically an echo what John said I mean
I think it's a cool piece of hardware I
don't know I haven't really used chrome
OS so I don't know about that but the
hardware itself is cool but at the same
time I'm using a laptop with better
specs right now and the only thing it
doesn't have is an SSD and an aluminum
body but it's got more RAM it's got
higher processing power and that cost me
about 600 bucks so that looking at a
pure SPECT wise I mean it's a really
cool I mean don't get me wrong I've been
drooling over it all day and I really
like that light bar it's it it's just
cool but I'm not gonna buy one I'm gonna
wait and see what happens down the road
that's that's long good so moving on to
the man that actually bought one already
Nate obviously you love it you bought it
uh yeah I started sweating as soon as I
saw the thing the difference is i live
in chrome I do ninety-nine percent of
what I do in chrome so that works for me
I am in the model for a premium laptop
because i'm tired of as John said really
poorly built windows 8 laptops and I
also really hate windows 8 and like John
I can't touch mac stuff I can't touch
their software I just can't stand it
like you said about buying every three
years I think that's what they're going
out with the storage they keep you tied
into that storage and you're going to
buy a device every three years to keep
that storage happening so that's where
I'm at and that's why I bought one good
good and last but not least mr. Anderson
Oh to this yeah heart was great um I
don't think they're gonna sell a whole
bunch but this is the progression of
chrome and they might just be kind of
overshooting as opposed to just
incrementally incrementally upgrading
and then they'll find like a middle and
so so what where does this leave the
previous rumors of you know we talked
about a possible Tegra 4 Chromebook so
you know there's some hints at some
Tegra 4 testing being done there was to
talk of a new puppy device because the
Chromebook pixel is most likely the the
link device that we've heard about so
what's puppy is is there still puppy you
know uh what does that mean well this is
a big dog then yeah there's going to be
a puppy down the road yeah I mean
there's there's been a sort of two
different code names circulating link
and puppy and so the link had been
rumored to have a 4-megapixel
touchscreen display in an ivory bridge
processor which obviously the pixel has
so pretty obvious that that's the link
and then there's this other puppy device
is the board name that as references to
Tegra 4 code so apparently there's
another Chromebook device floating out
there potentially with a Tegra 4
processor so I definitely see you know
if they're going to come up with a high
quality device a very high price like
this coming out with another high
quality arm-based devices love I spoint
Allah Windows RT vs surface pro maybe
we'll see it announced at i/o maybe
that's when the Tegra 4 Chromebook the
puppy will come out and maybe that'll be
that'll be my my seven eight hundred
dollar high-end you know girl book that
I wanted with a with this awesome
display I can see but she's not coming
out an eye out
just I know the Tegra 4 is probably
ready but I could see that as a good
consolation kind of a medium ground yeah
okay so let's let's move on but you know
I hate pushing news back from beginning
of the week and you know since this is a
weekly show not just a daily recap but
today was a big day so so let's talk
about ubuntu touch um yeah so let's talk
about the HTC one oh that's mean that's
okay so if you haven't tried a bun to
touch yet it's cool but think of it as
what happens in the Android world when a
new device a new android rom gets ported
to a new device the very first day that
it boots up you know in for a couple
weeks sometimes half the hardware
doesn't work it's slow but it's an alpha
it's the first build you know it's like
oh we have Wi-Fi working but you can't
see the camera yet or we don't have
Wi-Fi but we have audio or you know it
and and that's really what this is this
is your alpha Bill of an Android ROM
that somebody just got cm working on it
unofficially or something like that that
that's really what this is because it's
slow it stutters on the nexus 7 there's
no audio there's no camera I put it on
today at lunchtime thinking that this
was going to be so awesome and I'm I was
very very excited and then that
excitement turned to frustration after I
couldn't connect to my office's
enterprise Wi-Fi because I found out
enterprise Wi-Fi was not supported so I
played with it as you know doing nothing
opened up the camera oh wait camera
doesn't work on the Nexus 7 so I came
home hooked up to my personal Wi-Fi here
at my house and I played around from the
apps which are just you know web apps
which is fine um but like i said it's
it's a preview developer build it's
exactly what it is it's nothing more
it's not for a consumer it's for
somebody to develop one or it's for the
Susie asst to install it look at it and
then say okay cool all right I'll check
back in another month I'll check back
when you know preview release two is out
or the first big but you know bug fixes
out so if you're looking to install it
and you haven't yet there's two methods
to do so the official method from the
bunch of com wiki you need to have in a
bun to flavored OS like mint or a bun to
and you need to run some confirm inul
commands and basically it's leaving
Windows users you know the mass people
that have have computers did unable to
install from a computer and that's what
that's fine you actually don't need a
computer I didn't install it over a
computer I didn't use the official
method i downloaded the zip files which
will post those in a link here in a
little bit um and i downloaded the zip
files and actually made a tutorial today
so if you saw my post on Google+ you
know what I'm talking about you download
your board file for your your specific
device your specific Nexus device which
is the GSM galaxy nexus and nexus 7
Nexus 10 on the nexus 4 you download
that specific board device then you down
our board zip file and then you download
the actual you know ROM which is a like
a 500 Meg's if file and you flash both
of those in torpor clockworkmod and you
boot up and there you go it actually it
doesn't touch your SD card so if you had
an android on there which smells doing
android we're gonna do something crazy
like this you can restore your nandroid
and be good to go or you know flash your
factory images and keep your SD card
intact and we don't flash the the user
data so there's a lot of things you can
do to test it out in I like the method
that were used to you know we're used to
downloading and flashing you know a
couple zip files so I I did that and it
was really easy but did you like your
debit cash before you flash that
might've been one you have problems
swipe it twice get a wipe it twice yeah
and I actually wipe battery stats cuz I
heard you supposed to do that did you
why sure your wire get the rotation
stats yeah right you know will actually
you know what maybe that's why rotation
didn't work on the Nexus a but no we're
actually joking you don't need to
that um one quick thing about I I like
the the multitasking features there's an
app called glove box go pick it up if
you want to kind of test out their type
of multitasking it's pretty cool so if
you try to bunt to on the Nexus device
let us know in the comments what you
thought about it your initial
impressions on what you would like to
see come to Android from that what you
would like to see improved upon and now
I mean it's a developer builder chances
are they're going to still add some
things all I can say is a lot of the
features they showed and hyped up on
those uh those videos yeah you can't do
a lot of that yet you can do some of it
don't get me wrong you can do some but
it's it doesn't in their mind it doesn't
function the same way so I did any of
you guys here dude test it out at all
yet I don't have anything plaster what
about your next I guess I could try it
on my note alright so this week
something big that happened it didn't
happen today we're going to talk about
the HTC One and android authority was
there at the event uh my boy wookie he
was there he covered the event for us um
and he got to plug the device do some
comparisons some verses and so what you
want you to tell us you know how awesome
is the device tell us about sense tell
us about these new features the hardware
how's it feel is it is this a device
that we want you know have at it well
the thing is um and natan Derek you you
would know this from a private kind of
conversation that happened between
android authority people that are so
there was a conversation about how specs
are starting to become a little bit more
irrelevant now that things are getting
to a point where stuff just works and in
that respect I think the one could do
well because it basically in a lot of
ways it's it's kind of a DNA with an
aluminum body and a whole lot more
features the specs are bumped up a
little bit
but not all that much but I've got to
say I would if it was on verizon and I
could go back in time and have a one
instead of a DNA I would have a lot it's
pretty cool um since five well you know
what the heck it's hard to it's
different things that I like like I like
the fact that it's a bit more minimalist
in its display but blinkfeed not a fan
you mean we mean windows tiles you mean
windows a success no no no you mean
Flipboard you I yeah yeah exactly ah oui
Ahmed's little so so what do they do
they form partnerships with ESPN MTV
associated press two to bring news feeds
right to this tap this widget or
something called blinkfeed and isn't
since five really like it sends centered
all-round blinkfeed for your Emmy for
social as well like everything just
comes in there like it really reminds me
of windows tiles in or Flipboard um keep
in mind that I was actually before I say
this I'm actually kind of a fan of what
I've seen of the HTC One so far but
blinkfeed seems like they tried to find
the most efficient way to pull things I
really don't care about into one spot
that's a pretty good description but you
are a fan of sense though so it's coming
from somebody that likes sense yes the
one guy who actually likes attitude but
we're in the same now it does have a
1080p screen 468 PPI which is higher
than 4.7 inches it's one of the smaller
of these big yeah exactly that's
actually higher than the DNA because
it's it's three tenths vintage smaller
so and now the nice thing about this is
we're going to talk about processors a
little bit with Dan but it has one of
those brand spanking new Snapdragon the
600 processor so it's smoking fast it
looked really fast from the videos look
what the software was a lot lighter or
two so that
seemed lighter faster so yeah when
you're doing Flipboard and just
sometimes if for the Flipboard image
loading the hit looks a little bit more
lightweight than cell wiki did you get
to play around with the sound at all
like boom sound is the new buzzword you
know HTC said they were going to wow us
with audio which and my best
understanding is boom sound as Beats
Audio plus front speakers yes it's
exactly that so not all that much to be
excited about I mean like really if
you're an audiophile Beats Audio is I
mean yeah beats is probably gonna piss
you off a little bit because of the bows
with your sound and front speakers there
that's cool but I mean the guy from HTC
I can't remember which one it was I'm
sorry for dropping the ball on that but
was even he opened his talk at the event
talking about how sound on phones is
generally bad and that's really true
putting the speakers in the front
doesn't do a whole lot to help that no
it just makes him sound louder and dad
yes it's more allowed bad and with
election on command it means more low
rhythmic low mid range bad instead of
high mid range back so let's talk about
Zoe and you know in not some like hot
chick or anything like HTC's new new new
software for video and in picture and
all sorts of stuff that this is their
new revolutionary thing that they are
going to impress us with with the camera
HTC Zoe orzo yeah Zoe I would say is
probably the killer app of the one
actually getting to see that in in
action there are some very cool things
about it the first and most important
thing I think is actually the fact that
once you open up the camera it starts
running a kind of constant buffer so
that when you hit the shutter button it
captures four seconds and front of video
in addition to a picture but also a
second before you hit that shutter
and to make sure that if you hit it a
little bit to wait you might catch
something you would have missed
otherwise not as that I think is very
cool that's something i think uh
everybody should start ripping off
immediately no i don't like my battery
draining um I'm I got pretty quick
reflexes when something happens so I
don't know if I need it I mean it only
happens as far as I know when the camera
app is actually open and working but
yeah I mean that can definitely be a
battery drain but at the same time if
you're me uh I always capture pictures a
second to wait so me too I think that's
very very cool plus they're also packing
only a 4 megapixel camera sensor I mean
it's their fault ultrapixel record like
apparently 4 megapixels that's a lot
less data to process yeah the act of
taking a picture will not consume as
much battery is taking an 8 or 13
megapixel picture just because there's
literally millions fewer pixels to
process so they shit in in you know
technically speaking it should take a
better picture because they're
processing a lot less and a lot less
time frame a lot less dated a lot less
time frame well the processing speed
isn't really going to affect the quality
of the image with supposed to affect the
quality of the image here is the way
they're sort of setting up the camera
sensor by having a few errs who little
pixels they're able to mega pixels in
the camera they're able to spread them
out more so theoretically each one's
going to capture more light and
therefore more information even though
it's less overall number of pictures
pixels the quality should be a lot
better and so they're able to get a lot
better low-light and sort of natural
light conditions pictures whereas you
know lots of cameras do great and bright
light settings but most of life is not
in bright light settings no really
pixels didn't somebody from nokia have
to say something about these ultrapixels
yeah one of the PureView developers
apparently trashed it
basically said no that's all a lot of
crap in the beamer if you remember
PureView is probably one of the top
mobile cameras yeah it's amazing it's
actually the one thing that Windows
Phone can do yeah no no no you're pretty
much on running Sembia oh well it's like
the forty five megapixel camera again I
was running some now mr. if now they
just take the camera and put the
hardware on Android and they actually
have a phone that sells yeah so uh
Wookiee anything else about the one that
jumped out at you is hardware software
was well um yeah I mean it's just um
it's an easy thing to understate but
really it just felt nice um something
about that being a third of an inch
smaller you know screen wise than the
droid DNA it felt a lot easier to use
one handed I really like the aluminum
body I mean it's it makes it a little
bit heavier but it's just a nice solid
feel it does make nice devices they do
generally feel solid compared to that I
name it compared to the DNA is it a
fingerprint magnet no I mean the DNA is
a massive fingerprint magnet okay though
the the HTC the one I keep I feel I have
to say HTC before one because it just
feels some so we are calling something
wrong but anyway I didn't notice that I
mean the screen obviously but any spleen
is going to be a fingerprint moment like
crazy it wasn't that finger printed up
at all you were you were at CES for
never passing around the Xperia Z so
you've seen Sony's flagship for the
first year in HTC's which one you think
is the front-runner right now uh busy
that's just I think well I mean
personally I like the one better but if
you're asking which i think is going to
do better i think the observer the
Xperia Z has a lot more hype behind it
and for good reason I mean it's it's a
great device there's one more thing I
want to say before we get done with this
segment and this actually
nothing to do with the one but I did get
to talk to somebody about whether they
were thinking about porting sends five
to existing devices and apparently HTC
is investigating let's go for looking at
bringing it back to two devices like say
for example the the one x+ or the DNA
they just want to make sure that it will
work well so it's something they're
looking into they're not making any
promises that it's going to happen but
it's nice to know there at least
thinking about and you know what thank
God for talented Android developers that
will do it before they officially do
anyways yeah captain you got to let me
cuz I'm sorry it's called that's that's
like the DNA's crap hardware or
something you write a piece of software
and it can't run on the phone that's six
months old I mean mr. get the newest
just whether they had much of a lazy ass
that you don't want to support it in
that all right so let's let's get to the
fun part of the show that people are
watching live for that are listening for
on soundcloud or stitcher radio or
podbean or wherever the heck you're
listening to us right now from or
watching on YouTube as I said beginning
the show this is our one year
anniversary we've been doing this for a
year now and we part of it cruzerlite to
give you fifteen dollar gift card so we
have 10 of them to give away all you
need to do is go to this URL and fill

entry point for winning a gift card and
then sunday night 8pm comes around i
will hit the button the rafflecopter
will do its thing and we'll have ten
winners of $15 gift cards from
cruzerlite so i want you to do is go
it's a bit ly address which is bi t p
ILY so go to bit.ly/b IT period ly /a a
on air contest all inward one more time
for those of you the dinners daily mint
it is bi t period ly /a a 0 n a ir co n
te sta a on-air contest go there follow
like circle all that stuff and you'll be
entered into the contest said we're not
going to post this contest on our
website for people that don't watch the
show to enter this is strictly for
people that listen and watch live or the
recorded shows so congratulations to you
guys early to the winners and we will
announce them here in a few days and
thank you for watching us live and
contributing in the comments I love a
good discussion and I know people here
in this hangout do as well um thank you
yeah yeah yeah absolutely you guys
actually comment on posts or make memes
of a saying dumb things Samson don't
don't maybe yes game all this beam
everything don't we love that was a
question from one of those viewers is
this crystal aikin way open worldwide
errs this us home cruzerlite ships
everywhere but i didn't know this I want
to say I'm gonna have to check their
Amazon store but i believe they ship
everywhere but China is that does that
sound right good day i will die will
double check on that i did have the
details i don't have them right in front
of me i don't want to say something
incorrect what's available wherever
cruzerlite will ship to yeah there you
go there's a short answer wherever crews
are like ships to this this this goes
but i'll get the exact answer when i
announced the contest here a little bit
again sorry fuck you the URL doesn't
work somebody said I guarantee it works
so it's my comments no you're not
posting in the comments so i just
clicked on it again and it works so once
again for those of you that can
figured out di t that bit period ly bit
ly you've all seen these short links
before so it's bit ly Forge /a a as an
android authority 0 n a ir as an android
authority on air contest AAAA on air
contest I guarantee it works if you
can't get it to work I don't mean things
don't say anything say mean things like
say i'm not posting in the comments
because then somebody just reading
comments could get win and I don't want
to if you guys are loyal fans or loyal
listeners and Watchers I don't wanna do
that I want to make sure you guys have a
chance to win so try to keep keep trying
keep typing in it I don't know how else
to say AAA on air contest I reckon it
does work for me and walking if it works
for Wookiee trust me if he can figure it
out I mean don't be mean that guy hoping
my love you wookie I can barely tie my
shoes it's true alright so so let's
let's talk about some previous news
that's going on for the past week or so
um everybody loves dashclock dashclock
the widget that works for android 4.2
that's a lock screen widget as well as a
homescreen widget and it keeps growing
in popularity we keep getting more and
more extensions for more apps or being
updated to support the extensions and
it's awesome so just real quick those of
you that haven't tried it yet you should
try it if you have android 4.2 which
basically is a custom rom or a Nexus
device at this point not on verizon
custom rom it so there's a battery
extension as it is Facebook klum which
is Twitter's Falcon pro which does
twitter with the i actually don't use
twitter but from what I've seen in
friends that are using it they love it I
don't use whatsapp either but a lot of
people do whatsapp has an extension for
it any do a lot of people that actually
just came out the other day a lot of
people are using any do and annie's
extension is a contact dialer so you can
put like the
you're your significant other parents or
somebody you call your buddy you know
and somebody call the time and you tap
the button you can call them right from
the lock screen I don't know if you want
to do that all the time you know because
it's kind of like less secure but no
well yeah you wanna do it you can do it
um I'm impress the news reader is is
there and there's also an app launcher
so let's say you want to you want to put
an app to launch Chrome or to launch
voicemail you know right on the right
from the home screen now right from the
lock screen you can do that as well as
create your own that there's there's an
app called the custom xterra what's
called the desk lock custom extension so
you can go in there and create pretty
much anything you want to sign any
action to it so this will just basically
just search the Google Play Store or if
you have the latest version of dashclock
you can actually click the the about a
med drop down menu and it'll take you to
the searching the play store for more
extensions and the more extension you
have the better it gets I still talking
about apps Chrome Beta got updated today
it's a little bit faster not it is
heading in the right direction also
YouTube during the show did get updated
as well you can control the you're
pairing of the TV from the notification
bar kind of cool stuff after me so Dan I
heard some new processors yeah and
there's been a lot of processor and and
radio news for bass bad news this week
actually Qualcomm it previously
announced the Snapdragon two and four
hundred they actually detailed them this
week and I've also brought together the
details of the six and eight hundred as
well as their newly announced RF 360 the
one radio to move them all really and
we're gonna look at these and then
compare them with some of the new
announcements from Nvidia with their
Tegra 4 that's obviously already been
announced and then the new Tegra 4i the
lower power hopefully less expensive
version
that they have an integrated radio with
so getting started with Qualcomm we've
got the two and four hundred which are
their low end entries the 200 is
actually not even a Qualcomm designed
chip it's a arm cortex a5 quad-core CPU
at one point for gear hurts with an
entry no 203 GPU so that's an old GPU
and a low-power not very strong
processor so that's definitely low-end
but it is on 20 again our 28 animators
and it does support 1080p playback so
it's for low-end devices but it's still
able to deliver decent amount of
performance when stepping up to the next
level got the 400 which comes in two
configurations either a dual core Krait
presumably version 200 which is the same
things in the s4 and for pro but that's
not really certain dual core Krait at
1.7 gigahertz or quad core a seven at
one point 4 gigahertz so the a7 is for
example what's the little in the big
little octa-core configuration okay
though it's less powerful than a 9 but
not a lot and with four of them that can
be deliver a decent amount of power um
that's paired with the audrina 305 which
again is in the s4 yeah not the probe
the s4 again 1080 playback 13 plus
megapixel camera support both of these
are expected to be released this year
according to Qualcomm probably in q4 so
pretty late this year stepping that off
the 600 is actually the chip that's in
the HTC One and the optimus g pro that's
a 1.7 or 1.9 nigga hurts quad-core krait
300 processor with an Adreno 320 GPU
basically it's an s4 pro with some extra
bonuses added in it is faster it's about
forty percent pastor than the non-pro s4
the dual core one and then the 800
with that one's supposed to be at least
according to Qualcomm in q2 of this
device obviously it's already announced
in a couple of devices that are supposed
to hit on those timetables and then the
800 is coming in q3 again that'll be in
devices in q3 that'll be a quad-core
krait 400 at 2.3 gigahertz with the next
generation Adreno 330 GPU which is
supposed to be two times faster than the
320 that will support 4k displays that's
4096 x 2304 pixels or what they're now
calling Ultra HD as well as fifty five
megapixel camera support and quick
charge 2.0 which is supposed to be 75
percent faster than normal charging
snapdragons voice activation which is
basically I'm always listening to you
whisper level like voice commands for
your phone all told seventy-five percent
faster than the current s4 pro that's
the nexus for the DNA that's coming out
in just a few months I'm excited for the
quick charge to point out and also the
was it the voice activation if they can
do it without the battery loss I think
they'd be kind of cool if you could use
a duel now from a table that game
awesome yeah I mean that's really the
point of it is that it's supposed to be
super low power always listening so yeah
I mean that that ship just looks
incredible so what's this uh diamond in
the rough ah chip yeah so this RF 360 is
a new fully integrated sort of shell for
the rest of the baseband so really the
baseband is broken up into a lot of
little pieces and all come together and
this is a package of a bunch of those
pieces so it's going to support 40
different cellular bands across the
world Qualcomm's announced up with some
but ambiguous as to whether or not it
met 40 total or just 40 LTE bands but
regardless it will support every single
network that is currently in use on a
planet and every single network that is
currently planned to be in use on the
planet um one chip
supports all of the world's first modem
insisted antenna which will dynamically
in tune the antenna based on things like
how are you holding the phone we're
going to optimize the tuning of the
antenna to avoid your hand based on
things like what frequencies are you
trying to connect to we're going to tune
to the best frequency in this spectrum
and to get the best possible connection
um the world's first modem assisted
power tracking which basically is a way
that it's going to track power across
all of these various elements and you
know use all of that tracking to cut
down on power consumption affecting at
thirty percent lower power consumption
compared to the current already
industry-leading power low consuming
radios from Qualcomm it's also the
world's first multiband integrated power
amplifier and antenna switch so it's
built in the amplifiers for the antennas
and the switches to jump from 2g to 3G
to 4G all built in on the same piece of
hardware um it's also the world's first
3d RF package chip so it's not just a
wafer you know that takes up square
footage of your device it's a flan cube
and it's probably got cubic a bit its
stacking it so it's layering the
individual pieces on top of each other
to conserve more space um and this is
paired with a next generation
transceiver that's also supposed to
reduce power consumption by another
twenty percent supporting all the
regular suspects GPS Colossus video
which I don't really know it is plus a
Wi-Fi 802 11 or 80 to point 11ac that's
the one gigabit Wi-Fi standard plus you
know the usual bluetooth etc that's
supposed to get released also in q3
suspiciously similar to the release time
table for the 800 my guess is it will be
integrated into the 800 um so the
license would come with this the 800 and
this new LTE radio yeah are gonna be
like the god chip I mean 2013 is going
to be a great year for mo
technology so so so day and i have a
question uses we're on that subject 2013
is supposed to be the year that Verizon
completes their LTE network they're
suppose to do that actually sometime
this summer and then 2014 begin rolling
out besides just field trials of voice
over LTE yep what what will this process
or do for that well all of this I didn't
mention it but this also has full
support for LTE voice over LTE it also
has support for LTE Advanced and carrier
aggregation so what that allows carriers
to do with LTE advanced to sort of share
pieces of spectrum so if you have 10
mega 10 megahertz block out of the AWS
spectrum and I have the next 10
megahertz and then you have the next
time after that you can stack them
together to sort of create a better
connection out of it so this has full
support for all of that unfortunately
only two networks that I know that you
use that right now or one that was set
up for testing in Moscow and one that
t-mobile USA is not yet turned on but
the stacking that basically make a
bigger pipe so you can look okay yeah it
gives you a wider channels through which
you can run all the connections
obviously that means you can run higher
speeds more people or bad people going
through you're going to get more
information and get what they want
quicker okay just like more lanes on
highway it's basically spillover for
when you run out of exactly exactly in
one of the problems the carriers face
drive-ins buying it up either by an AWS
spectrum yep yeah i mean verizon AT&amp;amp;T
mobile all have plans to or already have
LTE on AWS who's know and most the hell
te canadian networks are on AWS as well
i think if is really going to
interoperate interoperability kind of
irrelevant says there's no excuse not to
be able to have a complete global launch
on a device on every device river yes
know when everything so whenever the
galaxy
cs4 comes out which is rumored to be on
a Qualcomm processor that if let's say
that rumor is true let's say it's not
using the octa because that is rumored
to be too hot yep they won't have this
belt it won't have this radio okay yeah
there's the moment your yeah it's gonna
come out in q3 I'm assuming the risk X
is gonna put out the s4 in pieces so the
the note 3 yeah maybe yeah any device
that any company I've ever releases
after q3 of 2013 if it doesn't work in
the next Nexus it's their own and all
that good stuff yeah i mean that's
that's huge supporting every network on
the planet at the same time it's just
ridiculous other processor news though
nvidia has been talking up their own
radio technology lately obviously they
had announced the Tegra 4 processor
which we know is a four plus one with a
cortex a15 cores running at what to I
think it's one point nine yards so I'm
going to check me on that one with a 72
core GPU um all on 28 nanometers
sporting displays up to 3,200 by 2000
really it's their top end processor
obviously they just recently announced
though their project gray which is
another Tegra 4i which really is
somewhat misleading because it's more or
less a shrunken and overclocked Tegra 3
processor with a built-in radio it's the
same for +1 rangement that we're
familiar with which is kind of annoying
because really in invidious case it's
one plus two plus two where you have
your one companion core that runs
everything and then two colors that will
come online and then when you need more
than that another two cores that will
come online you can't just get one of
those at a time it's two and two or four
but not one at a time um this one's down
to only a 60 core GPU same 28 nanometer
process really the thing that take that
n videos
with us is that it's only 60 millimeter
square it's very tiny chip they were
bragging about it being substantially
smaller than similar offerings from
Qualcomm um granted they said that
before Qualcomm made their 200 and 400
Snapdragon announcements just recently
so I don't really know what comparable
chip they were talking about because
nothing else is comparable in terms of
performance for what they're putting on
with this um the the real news there is
the I Sarah I 500 baseband and it's
going to support LTE 'the cat 3 and cat
for with carrier aggregation on TDD and
FTD standards there's big huge caveat to
that though the LTE advanced support
that's the camp for with carrier
aggregation is going to come with a
later software update not actually ready
yet in Nvidia's defense though there's
only two networks on the planet that use
that and neither of them Republic so not
really a big deal at the moment um it'll
also support gsm an edge hspa+ 42
td-scdma which is the networking
technology these most China but not cdma
so no verizon a no sprint for the Tegra
4i um it is also a software programmable
modem so you can actually similar to
Qualcomm sort of universal radio that
they just announced you can bring
differently two antennas to it and then
just reprogram the modem so it's less
hardware the people have that om sep to
buy but it's still not one universal
solution what Qualcomm suffering um the
big disappointing news out of this
though is the expected release date and
video expects to release it to OEM
sampling it by the end of 2013 that
means it's lonely in any devices until
q1 2014 that's alright that's a that's a
year from now yeah yes that is literally
a year from now where is not even six
months from now Qualcomm is going to
have a radio that does everything paired
with you know this ridiculously power
processor and in videos can be putting
out a cortex a9 clone whistling behind
in specs now yeah this thing is I don't
know that it's amazing but it is pretty
decent now by them yes it's mediocre
right now a year from now mm thanks
Camille and also the job like this this
chip was more or less promised as mid
year 2012 all right so Dan I think I
understand which one you're going to
choose just in case I've had a brain
malfunction between the new taggers and
the new snapdragons your money goes to
Qualcomm definitely Qualcomm I mean
looking at the stuff that Nvidia is
announcing especially with it being so
obviously side by side when it was like
two days later the Qualcomm came back
with the Snapdragon two and four hundred
announcement and then this RF 360 it
just makes any laughably far behind okay
all right well before we wrap up here
those of you that missed the segment
earlier or they're just watching random
parts of the show or listening to random
parts of the show shame on you oh you
should be listening to whole show you
guys so give away cruzerlite thank you
very much cruzerlite we're giving away
10 different fifteen dollar gift cards
which you can use to buy various
cruzerlite cases and other goodies I
personally just go to three crucial egg
cases the URL to enter the contest the
rafflecopter where you circle plus
things you follow things you like things
the standard rafflecopter stuff you go
to be IT period ly /a a 0 n a ir cont
EST that is bit ly /a a on-air contest
do all the things and you get a few
entries and we'll let you know sunday
night at 8pm after the drawing once
again this is our one year show so we've
been doing is for
a long time we've had a lot of guests on
the show we started out a year ago as I
said reviewing Mobile World Congress
when hangouts on air were in beta nobody
was actually doing on on air shows about
android on google+ it's not are actually
the first people to if we could say
pioneer that because nobody else was
doing it yet on google+ should say that
we pioneered it we were the first people
to do it and we loved it it was a hell
of a lot of fun obviously we've been
doing it for a year now um in that year
we've had a lot of cool stuff on the
show we've had a lot of developers we've
had Francisco Franco from franco.kernel
on the show we've had the whole entire
miui me you I didn't US team on the show
various times of various developers from
that team a couple of different times on
here talking about different projects
are working on in the rom itself for
