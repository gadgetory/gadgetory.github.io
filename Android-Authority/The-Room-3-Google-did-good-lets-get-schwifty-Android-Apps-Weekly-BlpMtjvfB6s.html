weekly show is brought to you by as nog
hello again ladies and gentlemen I'm Joe
Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to the android apps weekly
show this is episode number 144 let's
get started Netflix has announced that
they plan on clamping down on proxy and
VPN access in the wake of becoming a
worldwide presence the idea is to keep
people from viewing content that isn't
supported or supposed to be available in
their region it sucks but here's hoping
that region restrictions are a
short-term problem the change should be
going out in the coming weeks after a
very long wait Google Play has finally
introduced promo codes for developers
now devs can send people promo codes to
their applications to give it to them
for free the codes will work on upfront
prices and in-app purchases but not for
subscriptions they are also limited to
giving away only 500 per quarter or
about 2,000 per year lenovo reps stated
in a recent article that Google Play
services are returning to China sometime
in 2016 this is a huge deal because
there are a ton of Android users in
China and the hope is that Google can
unify the application ecosystem and
stabilize their operating system in that
country stay tuned because if this is
true things are going to get really
interesting google also released a
master list of a hundred and fifty four
tips that should help people use google
services better than they could before
the list includes voice commands
chromecast tips and more information
that spans 20 Google applications and
services and even Android itself even
the pros should take a look at this just
to see if there's anything that they
didn't already know Apple music
announced that they have hit 10 million
paying subscribers in just six months
that's a ridiculous amount of people
signing up for the service and it no
doubt has other streaming services
shaking in their boots for some context
it took Spotify six years to hit the
same milestone and we're not entirely
sure google play music all access has
that many at all for even more Android
apps and games news updates and releases
don't forget to check out this week's
newsletter which is linked in the video
description below there are a metric ton
of things that we didn't get to this
time around if you want to see the rest
of it if you want you can also subscribe
to the newsletter using the
arm in the written companion which is
also linked in the video description
below and we'll send it to your inbox
every single Sunday okay folks let's
take a look at the apps and games that
made a big splash this week as usual if
you want to check any of those apps or
games up you can find those links in the
video description below I have no mouth
is a port of the classic 1995 pc game of
the same name it is a point-and-click
adventure game with some text based RPG
elements that has you playing as five
characters who are being eternally
tortured by a super computer that has
enslaved the world as you can imagine
the storyline is quite dark and graphic
there is an option to use touch controls
or on-screen controls graphic settings
alternate endings and a lot more best of
all there are no in-app purchases sk r
WT is a photo manipulation tool that
boasts a lot of functionality the idea
behind the application is to correct
issues like lens distortion change
aspect ratios and vignette correction
however you can get creative and warp
photos into unique abstract images that
you can then post just about anywhere
it's mostly useful for serious
photographers who need to get lens
correction done and there are a ton of
features available it's 99 cents which
isn't a bad price the pocket Morty's is
the hyped up Pokemon parody based around
Adult Swim's hit show Rick and Morty you
control Rick and you must battle your
Morty against other risks with their
Morty's much like you battle pokemon
against other trainers there is a story
about how the Morty's are being
separated from their Rick's and it
features a ton of the game's usual
quirkiness and fun phrases it's a fun
game so pick it up beat up some more T's
earn some SH meckel's and get swifty
facebook mentions was released earlier
this week and this is an application
that none of you will probably use it's
meant for the popular rich famous and
otherwise celebrity or celebrity
adjacent crowd to help better manage
their fan pages you can post live videos
reply to fans and post updates on
Facebook Twitter and Instagram
simultaneously I would have tried it out
but it turns out I'm not even celebrity
adjacent so you know oh well the room 3
will likely be the most popular and
highly rated paid game of 2016 it had
large shoes to fill because the room 1
and 2 were amazing games so far it
appears as though the room 3 has matched
answer past the prior titles in almost
every way it keeps to its Cormac
cannock with clever puzzles and amazing
graphics but also adds in expanded
environments and new IPs to help find
clues and even alternate endings it also
comes with google play games
achievements and cloud saves it's four
dollars and ninety-nine cents with no
in-app purchases this week's Android
apps weekly is sponsored by as nog as
nog is a calling service that boasts the
ability to make free phone calls to any
as nog user and get this any landline
free of charge during our testing asthma
did precisely that and all ten phone
calls we placed went through that means
the recipient of the phone call didn't
have to have as nog installed and it
worked pretty well this is in stark
contrast to a lot of applications such
as skype or viber where you must pay
money to call landlines on top of this
useful functionality the application
maintains a simple functional and
good-looking interface rooted in
material design it's a fun little
application it's entirely free and it
seems to work pretty well for more
information you can also check out their
official websites give it a shot and
