Authority what's going on if your buddy
and I'm gonna be honest with you I'm
pretty excited about this one right here
this is the Panasonic cm-1 smartphone
dmcc m1 is the technical name for it
here and really this is the iteration
from Panasonic that takes Android
smartphones and puts
Panasonic Lumix optics on the back and
you can see already here this is
basically a point-and-shoot camera but
on the other side we have the Android
iteration let's take a look at some of
the elements around here we do have this
brushed aluminum feel here what really
strikes me about this phone from the
get-go is the fact that it actually
doesn't really feel all that heavy it's
pretty light in the hand the optics on
the back do kind of protrude into where
your hand will lay but it still feels
really nice and really with a 4.7 inch
screen it's not going to be too big
especially for those of you who might
have a little bit smaller hands but at
4.7 inches you get a really nice view
finder with the camera controls right
here that will make things really easy
to use and still keep things pretty
pocketable let's take a look at some of
the specifications underneath though we
do have the Snapdragon 801 so you're
gonna get a lot of good power out of
this the 801 might not be the most
cutting-edge in terms of processing
power but that is not going to be much
of a problem as we know the 801 is still
able to perform very well Android 4.4
KitKat is what we're working with here
if you haven't if you can really tell
already
and right there 4.4.4 and as far as
internals go the sixteen gigabytes of
on-board storage can be bolstered with
micro SD cards of up to 128 gigabytes
and capacity a 2600 milliamp hour
battery is going to be able to power
this phone and with the camera optics on
the back we're going to see if that
really hinders or is not really that
effecting of the battery life for the CM
one but now let's talk about this camera
here the camera itself is a twenty point
one megapixel one inch Maus sensor that
comes in at AF 2.8 aperture and 20
millimeters is the
Oh length the mechanical sugar is in
here and you have all you have different
aperture shutter and manual modes that
are available as far as video recording
goes we also have 4k video recording
here as well something that panasonic
has been a pioneer of over the last
couple of the year so let's go ahead and
just jump into the camera itself and you
can already see that just with the way
that the camera looks in the viewfinder
this is almost like a point-and-shoot
camera by Panasonic from the get-go
we're gonna take a look at some of the
whoops there you go we're gonna take a
look at some of the menu items there are
different metering modes focus modes a
lot of options here even an HDR mode and
of course touch to autofocus and shoot
but let's head back there I'm going to
change up the display a little bit so we
can see some other elements here open up
the menu now here's the menu we have a
lot of different options over here from
the photo styles and whatnot to
different aspect ratios a lot of the
features that you have on the point
shoot cameras and even on the DSLRs if
you guys don't know already I'm a big
Panasonic fan in that I love their
cameras and I use the gh4 as my work
camera halfway down to focus and it
looks like the focusing time is very
quick everywhere to take a quick picture
over here this is just a first look here
at CES 2015 at the CM one fun that I'm
really excited to use on the daily and
see what happens with it because well
here at CES they announce that this
phone is officially coming to the US so
keep it to to Android authority for all
of the best coverage and clean my future
review of this particular phone right
here at the Panasonic cm-1 now this is a
very exciting phone so please stay tuned
for my camera shootout and all of my
comparisons to some of the other optics
that are available but honestly right
now this does sound like one of the most
powerful ones keep it tuned to Android
already because we are your source for
all things CES 2015</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
