unveiled a litter of new smartphones and
at least one new dumb phone whilst the
Nokia 800 Co was definitely the big
flagship of the set it was actually the
Nokia 7 Plus that in many ways garnered
more attention that's because it
represented at least on paper some
serious bang for your buck why do we get
a Nokia 7 plus and a Nokia 8 Sirocco I
don't know because hmd is quirky I guess
for considerably less than a flagship
device at 349 99 here in the UK the
Nokia 7 plus nevertheless manages to
give you a lot of flagship e goodness
that means things like an 18 by 9 aspect
ratio a dual lens camera with bokki mode
really impressive build quality but
whilst it's very good on paper let's
take a closer look and see if this is
really the premium affordable device to
beat so first up the design which really
is quite eye catching and impressive
this device is machined from a single
block of 6000 series aluminium and it's
coated with multiple layers of ceramic
paint that not only gives it a nice
matte feeling in the hand but it also
manages to hide any visible antenna
lines so it's a nice sleek finish all
down the back it's not to fingerprint e
and it feels nice and grippy in the hand
it's a slim device it's light and it has
this nice color accent around the edge
always bronze but you can get the body
in either black or white on the hull it
looks and feels like a fairly premium
device it's not going to compete with a
top of the range Samsung but it's
definitely a lot nicer than your average
budget phone that's for sure as I
mentioned it's also got an 18 by 9
aspect ratio so this phone feels nice
and modern in keeping with current
trends also means you get a nice big 6
inch space to consume media whilst it's
not an AMOLED display it is a very good
high-quality IPS LCD display with great
color reproduction it's 1080p by tu-160
and it's great for consuming media good
viewing angles good brightness overall a
great experience
and I can't really fault the display the
speaker of course is also important for
consuming media and whilst it's in prime
location for blocking with your hand
loss gaming it is nice and loud and
certainly gets the job done more
importantly you'll also find a headphone
jack up top which a lot of people are
going to be very happy about there's a
fingerprint sensor around the back which
I find works really quickly actually and
that's also where you'll find the nice
dual lens camera one above the other
right in the middle and I'll talk more
about that in a moment you can swipe
down on that fingerprint sensor to bring
down the notification tray though this
setting is off by default just FYI
there's no water-resistant rating so you
will have to be careful with this device
but otherwise it's solidly built and
very reliable but unless you're going to
hang this thing on the wall then what's
far more important than the looks is the
performance and fortunately it does
fairly well in that category too it's
powered by a Snapdragon 660 backed up by
4 gigabytes of RAM and it's part of the
Android 1 program which means that
you'll get regular security updates and
OS updates for at least two years and
hmd global have been very good with that
in the past so far the 660 isn't widely
used outside of China yet but it
performs very well especially when
paired with that pure version of Android
which ensures that navigating the UI is
never a struggle everything nips along
breezily you can swipe for your images
you can multitask with no problem the 4
gigabytes of RAM seems ample for that
and gaming is absolutely fine you should
have no problem running anything on the
Play Store to give you an idea of how
the CPU is going to perform it's roughly
equivalent to say a Galaxy Note 7 I will
say that whilst the performance has been
very good for me on the whole though I
have had a few glitches and setbacks at
one point my camera got stuck in the
wrong orientation so it was sideways
when my phone was portrait and vice
versa which was strange I've had the
occasional stutter had a few apps crash
on me and for some reason my Bluetooth
headphones really don't wanna play nice
with it and neither does my garmin
vivoactive so I don't know if that's a
defect in my unit but I've got to review
the phone I have in front of me and yeah
that's a bit annoying a little bit
glitchy I also had some problems with
audio syncing with the camera which I'll
talk about more in a moment
every now and then during gaming I've
noticed a slight stutter likewise when
switching to my google feed so it's not
a perfect experience but you probably
won't expect that for the price and it's
certainly more than serviceable and
should be fine for most of your needs
one other thing I wasn't super happy
with day was the auto brightness and I
found that it was a bit too sensitive
and jumpy so it would just go straight
from being very dim to being very bright
just as I walked underneath the shadow
and eventually I just had to turn that
off because I found it irritating again
your mileage may vary it might mean me
just being sensitive but that's what I
found anyways of course that Android one
membership is also going to be a boon
for anyone who likes that pure Android
experience it means that there's no
bloatware and anyone who's familiar with
using a pixel should bank this is a
relatively similar experience personally
I they've mined a bit of a UI layer and
a little bit of bloatware I find that it
can be nice to have something unique to
play around with when you get a new
phone out of the box but that's a matter
of opinion and I know that a lot of
people much prefer the pure stock
Android experience
there's also 64 gigabytes of storage
which is generous and that's expandable
by up to 256 gigabytes via an SD card
aDNA problem with signal call quality
was very good no dropped calls or
anything like that my Wi-Fi came through
nice and strong so on the whole it
performed well knock it calls this the
phone that you can rely on and on the
whole I'd say that's true apart from the
occasional glitch that I noticed some of
that I'm hoping might be ironed out with
future software updates what's really
impressive is the battery which is a
3,800 milliamp hour and when you combine
that with the Android one pure
experience it's more than sufficient see
through a day in fact most people should
have no problem getting a day and a half
even on moderate to heavy usage and some
people should have no problem getting
all the way to two days so that's nice
and that's the kind of thing that really
does make a phone feel reliable because
it means that it's always there and
always on when you want it it can also
charge really quickly up to 50 percent
in 30 minutes through the USB type-c
port and on the whole it's very good for
those kinds of power users something
that HMT has been really keen to focus
on and no pun intended is the camera set
up on the
devices and the Nokia seven-plus has a
particularly compelling suite when
compared to others at this price range
so you're getting not only a primary
shooter of 12 megapixels backed up by a
13 megapixel telephoto lens which gives
you 2 times optical zoom but also a
front facing camera with 16 megapixels
it's all Zeiss branded and on top of
that you're also getting the both II
mode the dual lens gives you the ability
to do bouquet and portrait mode you're
getting the same image sensor as found
in the pixel 2 and on the whole it looks
like there's an awful lot of promise
here and you're getting the spatial
audio recording which should give you
the ability to record surround sound so
in theory this is a really good device
for content creators for social media
junkies and reading some of the other
reviews I'm allowed to do that when I'm
reviewing a phone I found that a lot of
people really rated this camera highly
considering its class personally though
I guess I went into it expecting little
bit too much and I was slightly
disappointed slightly let down by it I
found that occasionally it would be
overexposed sometimes it was hard to get
the exposure right things would be
weirdly bright for apparently no reason
I got blur quite a lot the time even
when I was trying to be still there's no
optical image stabilization and the
electronic image stabilization seems to
me to be a bit iffy I guess or the
shutter speeds a bit slow either way
there's a pro mode which of course means
you can tweak things like the ISO the
shutter speed the aperture all yourself
but for me I think a good phone cameras
one that you can just point and shoot
and especially if it's the marketing
itself towards people who use a lot of
social media the Botha mode is something
of a gimmick so the idea is that you
record from the rear camera on the front
camera at the same time and this would
then allow you to share moments with
friends or stream things on facebook
which you can still do and it's a nice
idea in theory although not all that
useful in practice and especially when
you consider there's apps out there that
can already do this on pretty much any
device I thought I'd give it a go though
say when I was walking home from
Avengers infinity war I thought I'd do
some vlogging for my personal YouTube
channel so I walked down a path and I
was talking I thought I'd show where I
was going at the same time as sharing my
V's on the film unfortunate when I got
home after recording for about
ten minutes I found that the audio is
out of sync with the video and I
couldn't use it which obviously was a
bit disappointing and considering that
this is supposed to be a great camera
for both these and for audio it was a
little bit of a letdown really good
workout because I used infinity war as
my pre-workout and was pumped it's an
awesome film I highly recommend it it
was I was gonna film some parkour don't
get me wrong though this isn't a
terrible camera by any means and if you
are willing to put in a bit of work then
you can get some nice photos it's nicely
saturated which I personally enjoy it
has very good low-light performance
although if you zoom in closely you'll
notice a bit of noise and lots of detail
it's got a nice aperture F 1.75 which
means you can get some great shallow
depth of field effects going on and
which means you can get lots into the
frame the selfie camera on the other
hand is only f 2.0 as I tried to use
this to record myself in the gym and not
only was it too zoomed in to really work
in that context but it also was again
overexposed very bright and dark and
patches and I couldn't really use it of
course having two times optical zoom is
very nice and so is having that second
lens so that you can do the portrait
mode or the bucket effect I will say
that if you're not using a pixel then
very often this is a bit fiddly and hit
and miss this is no different but if
something else to play around with then
it can result in some really nice
portraits so on the whole I'm not
knocking this camera it's very good for
the price I'm just saying don't expect
it to be on par with a flagship quite
and if you're a social media
professional or if you're a content
creator or an Instagram aficionado then
I would say that perhaps if you have a
bit more money by a pixel - or a galaxy
s 9 something like that if you have a
limited budget and you want a phone with
a decent camera then this is it so on
the whole to sell my experience with the
Nokia 7 plus I think it's a great phone
it's not outstanding really in any way
it's not going to turn heads with the
design the camera isn't comparable to a
premium device even though it comes
close and the performance is similar to
a flagship a couple of generations back
but for the price it's still really good
as a really well-made device it's true
that it
let you down the battery life can go for
days the screen looks great it feels
really good in the hand and there's lots
of cool options to play around with in
the camera obviously Android ones gonna
be a big advantage for a lot of people
as well and on the whole it's just a
solid stable reliable and well made
phone that is fairly easy to recommend
so thanks time for watching guys hope
