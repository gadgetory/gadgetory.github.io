Android authority and the note series
has become one of Samsung's most popular
line of smartphones and we've got the
latest one in the house this is your
unboxing and first impressions of the
brand-new samsung galaxy note5 so the
first thing you're going to notice with
the box is it looks just like the
Samsung Galaxy s6 box so they've
completely done away with those fake
wood boxes from before and now you just
have a clean white box with the galaxy
note 5 branding on the front in big bold
letters and some call-outs on the rear
for the specs which we'll go over in a
second opening the box you'll be greeted
immediately by the note 5 wrapped in a
plastic sleeve but before we get into
all of that let's take a look at what
else you get inside the box underneath
is a QuickStart guide for getting
started quickly that you can choose to
read if you want but most likely you
probably won't
next you have your sim removal tool
that's attached to a plastic tray and
below that tray are the rest of the
goodies you have your standard micro USB
cable a wall adapter extra replacement
tips for the S Pen along with a removal
tool and some very nicely packaged
Samsung earbuds and that's pretty much
it of course what you all want to see is
the note 5 and as you can see the one
that I have here is the gold platinum
version and I have to admit I really
like the way the gold looks on the note
5 I think it looks pretty sleek the big
story here however is the change in
design and the note 5 basically follows
in the footsteps of the s6 with a
combination of metal and glass so no
longer is the back removable which takes
away the ability to swap batteries and
the battery on the note 5 actually got a
little bit smaller at 3000 milliamp
hours from the 32 20 milliamp hour
battery on last year's note for the
phone does feel very nice in the hand
though and for a 5.7 inch smartphone it
doesn't feel extremely big in the hand a
lot of that has to do with how much
Samsung has slimmed down the bezels on
the note 5 and it's practically smaller
than the note 4 in every dimension the
curves along the sides of the back make
the phone very comfortable to hold but
it is a little bit slippery and attracts
fingerprints very easily due to the
glass and
design but overall I'm in love with the
look and the feel of the note 5
I think Samsung did a really fantastic
job going around the device you've got
your power button on the right volume
rockers on the left the SIM card tray on
the top but one thing you'll notice is
there's no IR blaster anymore so you
won't be able to use the note 5 to
control your TV or other peripherals on
the bottom is the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack micro USB port a speaker
and of course the s-pen which we'll get
into in a sec continuing on to the back
there's a 16 megapixel camera along with
the heart rate sensor and it's the same
camera sensor from the s6 so you can
probably already expect some really
great quality photos from the note 5
finally on the front of course you have
the standard Samsung home button which
also doubles as a fingerprint scanner
just to recap some of the internal specs
you have the Exynos 7420 which is also
the same as the s6 but the note 5
features 4 gigs of ram instead of 3 so
performance should be just as good as
the s6 if not a little bit better due to
that extra gig of memory
speaking of memory the note 5 comes in
32 or 64 gigabyte versions with no
microSD card expansion another feature
that has been taken away in the note
line the display measures in at 5.7
inches with the same quad HD resolution
and it's an AMOLED screen just like last
year's Note 4 and the screen looks
absolutely amazing not exactly sure how
Samsung does it but the screens on their
smartphones seem to just get better and
better every year and the note 5 screen
is easily one of the best I've seen on
any smartphone jumping back to the s-pen
it's been improved in a lot of ways both
on a hardware and software level the
s-pen ejects out of the silo now which I
really like and it's cool and fun to do
but in a way it makes getting the S Pen
out a little slower because there's that
additional step of having to eject the
pen first before pulling it out a step
that you didn't have to do before on the
prior note models but the new clicky top
to the S Pen makes it feel more like a
real pen so I do enjoy that quite a bit
you still have air command to create
memos right on the screen and take notes
just like before but now you have the
ability to add a couple of app shortcuts
which i think is really useful and the
new screen off memo
is also a very handy feature when you
need to quickly jot something down and
the cool thing about it is it'll
automatically save the note for you once
you reinsert the s-pen but that is
really it guys for this quick unboxing
and first impressions Josh will be doing
the review of the note 5 so make sure
you stay tuned for that and subscribe if
you haven't already so you don't miss
