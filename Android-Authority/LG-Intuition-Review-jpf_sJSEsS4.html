clayton youngberg with android authority
calm today we've got an in-depth review
of the LG intuition for verizon this is
a brand-new phone it's a 4G LTE capable
device it's a five inch device so that
categorizes this is a phablet and it has
a lot of impressive specs as well some
cool intuitive software features we're
just going to go ahead and go over the
software hardware build quality
everything about this phone that makes
it special so let's go ahead and check
out the body as you can see right here
on top we already have some nice
lighting accents that are on the power
switch we also have some protection for
a micro USB slot we can simply slide
that open and shut and then we have our
dedicated screenshot key which is also
intuitive with the software quick memo
we also have our eight millimeter
headphone jack nothing on the left side
on our bottom all we have is the small
microphone on the right side we've got a
volume rocker up and down each a
dedicated button with a nice space in
between and then we also have our SIM
slot right here we have a non-removable
battery but it is still fairly large in
size gives you a lot of talk time
especially a lot of standby time we've
got an eight megapixel camera in the
rear with LED flash and we have a 1.3
megapixel camera in the front as well as
all our different light sensors a small
speaker here then also on the front we
have our dedicated capacitive touch keys
right here we've got the back the home
the recent apps button and then we also
have our menu button as you can see
we're on our lock screen right here we
can kind of just press anywhere we would
like and swipe to open it up we also
have our quick shortcuts down here for
phone messaging gmail camera and
notebook which of course are
customizable we have access to a
notification bar in the lock screen as
well and we have our Wi-Fi notification
all of our usual stuff that's packed in
ice cream sandwich anzhela can customize
the home screen LG has the optimist skin
running over android 404 and we have a
lot of cool intuitive widgets and
software that's packed into this device
so we'll go ahead and go open our app
tray you see we have five across nice
screen space takes advantage of the five
inch display now this is a 5 inch
display but this is the LCD TFT with a
resolution of 768 by 1024 so it has a
strange screen resolution but we are
getting a good PPI we have about 250 PPI
give or take we also have a 1.5
gigahertz dual-core Snapdragon s3
processor now the s3 is not the newest
from Snapdragon it's dwarfed by the s4
and s4 pro of course but it still does
provide a lot of you know nice speed
nice fluid video game play all sorts of
stuff and it does really power the
display now sometimes we have some lag
when it comes to leaving the app tray
and going to the home screen or leaving
a specific app and going to the home
screen but other otherwise does work
really well we can pull down our status
bar here we have all our different
toggles for the quick memo we have the
different toggles for silent mode
Bluetooth NFC of course this is an NFC
capable device and we've got our
brightness toggle as well and also edit
these toggles choose their order and
which toggles do appear we have our
Wi-Fi which is the dedicated button
right here for most of the Wi-Fi and
then we can access our settings now all
of the menus are themed with the Optimus
UI but we do get our Wi-Fi Bluetooth
data usage for ice cream sandwich and
then our options under the more tab and
scroll down we have sound options
display options under the display
options we can choose the auto rotate
screen screen brightness we can even
choose our font type our font size and
then we can correct the aspect ratio for
a lot of our apps and stuff we can
choose the duration of the front key
lights as well we also have gesture
support much similar to the galaxy s3 we
can choose an icon and kind of moved
across the screen just by tilting the
device and whatnot apps management power
saver which is really cool as a lot of
cool features baked in there of course
we have our verizon bloatware the backup
assistant and stuff like that hopefully
this gets a root method soon so you can
remove the bloatware we also have a
developer options for Android Ice Cream
Sandwich and if we go under the about
phone and under the software information
we see we are running the for dot 0 dot
for trying to get our Easter egg and we
do have our Easter egg which looks
really nice a lot of apps do look
nice with the 5 inch display but a lot
or you can see the lag right here so
there it is guys the s3 processor
lagging huh anyways it does usually work
really nicely as you can see now it's
going and we can use of our we can make
use of our roberti and pen which is
pretty intuitive but of course as a lot
of people know there's nowhere to keep
it on the phone but like i mentioned in
our galaxy s3 comparison a lot of cases
should be coming out that you can have
an area to put the stylus and also some
cases might have some extended batteries
for this bad boy well anyways the pen
works pretty nicely we can swipe left
and right use any of our intuitive apps
such as the quick memo we can go ahead
and demo out our quick memo dedicated
button simply press the button it takes
a screenshot now in the screenshot we
can edit to whatever we have captured so
we can make a note to our friends you
know choose our different pen tools our
pen sizes choose our judgement eraser
tools choose where to save it we can
even share the image so we would circle
that we can save damage to either our
notebook app or the gallery now if we
save it into the gallery we can access
it from going to the gallery and
likewise if we save it to the notebook
we can quickly go into the notebook and
access those so here's the notebook this
is lg's it own proprietary app we can
choose a new note choose all of our
different parchment styles paper colors
and then our bindings will go back and
we have a similar app called tasks we
have all of our different tasks that we
can do and assign and then complete so
this device does have a lot of cool
productivity apps built right in and
then it also has a lot of the verizon
bloatware but we do have our alarm clock
it's got audible it's got email of
course all of our google apps such as
Gmail Google+ also got some weather apps
video is video player VZ navigator
youtube we have our downloadable widgets
excuse me we have our downloads tab and
our widgets now the download shows you
everything you personally have
downloaded widgets as well a lot of cool
custom LG widgets available music
players and whatnot and then of course
we can choose and uh well we
downloads and then choose which apps
show up in the actual downloads pages in
which in the apps pages are sorting
options and stuff like that which leads
me into the theming options you can do
with this now you can simply grab an
icon and you can change the way it
appears you can change its actual photo
icon and then we can choose the theme
whether it be optimist biz light or
sketch we can access that from the
settings as well we go here into the
display options actually yes that is the
display options and then we can choose
our no it's not so LG does provide us
with thieving options and stuff like
that we can also choose certain apps and
not only use them as the app but we can
actually create a widget out of them if
we grab and we can expand well obviously
messaging is not one of the ones we can
do that but a lot of cool apps are like
that grab a app and we can simply just
drag it into the size of a widget now
this phone does run pretty fast it runs
quickly this s 3 processor doesn't um
you know really slow the thing down but
you can see that we're using most of our
Ram at all times even if we clear the
ram the ram has been optimized we're
still using a lot of RAM this does have
one gigabyte of RAM which is on par with
most of the phones these days but it's
not anything incredible like the two
gigabytes of RAM in the galaxy s3 also
available on verizon make sure to watch
our smackdown between this and the
galaxy s3 because that is one of the
other hotter phones on verizon and if
you've got any questions about the LG
intuition go ahead and drop us a line
you can always interact with us on
Facebook Google+ Twitter and of course
YouTube and our website that's basically
the LG intuition for verizon if you're
looking for a phablet device and you're
on Verizon and you don't want to hold
out for the note to you can still have
the power of the galaxy or the
Snapdragon s3 process so if you're
looking for a tablet you can still have
the power of the Snapdragon s3 processor
one gigabyte of RAM and then a nice big
five inch screen we're going to see
jellybean coming to this device in the
near future hopefully already got ice
cream sandwich big beautiful display
blazing fast processor I was scored
the upper three thousands on the
quadrant test so it does keep up with
the galaxy s3 nice sound nice build
quality to it does have the you know not
really rounded edges but we don't want
to get sued by that one infamous company
huh anyways yep that was our review guys
so if you've got any questions feel free
to ask this is clayton youngberg with
android authority calm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
