authority and today we're taking a look
at the kalakeya ultra slim case and as
the name suggests this is an ultra-thin
and super lightweight case Kelly case
actually claims that this is the world's
thinnest case on the market and at only
point 35 millimeters thin I don't doubt
that claim one bit this case feels
extremely paper thin thinner than any
other slim style case that I've ever
seen or used before it's almost like a
thin piece of rice paper and if it was
any thinner it'd probably be a skin it's
seriously that thin like many other
shell type cases installation is a
breeze just like your phone and on one
end snap the corners into place and you
are done the case utilizes a frosted
clear finish which allows your phone is
still semi show itself and it's also
really great at deterring fingerprints
and there's a subtle texture to this
case that really helps with the grip and
should make it easier for you to keep a
hold of your phone especially on a phone
like the note 5 which we all know is a
somewhat slippery phone the fitment is
generally pretty good and all the
cutouts where the buttons and ports line
up nicely and are cut to precision that
being said I did run into some fitment
issues with the sides of the case
feeling slightly loose on the version
made for the note 5 I however did not
run into this problem with a one made
for the s6 which fit perfectly snug so
it may just vary from one device to
another another issue that I've had with
this case is that it makes the power and
volume buttons completely flush and
because the cutouts leave very little
space for your thumbs or finger to sink
in and press them feeling around for the
buttons is a little bit more difficult
than normal the Kelly case ultra slim is
available for the note 5 s6 s6 edge and
s6 edge+ and color options include clear
black clear white clear blue and clear
emerald green now if you purchase cases
purely for protection this case is not
for you it's really not designed to give
you a whole lot of drop protection but
if you're just looking for a case that
is stylish minimal that doesn't add a
whole lot of bulk the ultra slim case by
cali case is a perfect option that's
also very affordable but that's really
going to do it for this video guys
hopefully you enjoyed it and found it
