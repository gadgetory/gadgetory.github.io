my name is Jace and boy oh boy has not
only flagship season officially begun
but maybe perhaps we spotted the Nexus 6
in the wild oh yeah now the real
question is how will that measure up to
the king of tablets that is the Galaxy
Note 4 yes that's right we believe that
Google may in the next six to eight
weeks unveil the next member of the
Nexus family and it could look like this
keep in mind that these renders were
made by Android Police Android life and
as always with this kind of rumor
speculation is advised if the renders
details are correct the phone will
apparently have a front-facing stereo
speaker and a few changes when it comes
to the icons on the home screen as well
the size of the phone will also have the
same metallic frame as the new Moto X as
for what the phone will be called while
rumors have gone back and forth between
the Nexus X and the Nexus 6 a new report
from Android Police claims they can
confirm it will indeed be called the
Nexus 6 and that it will have a 5.9 inch
display with qHD resolution it will
reportedly have a 13 megapixel shooter
with 0 is and the same dual flash ring
configuration as the new Moto X there
will also be said to be a 2 megapixel
camera and a 3200 milliamp hour battery
so I'm curious is this enough info but
the Nexus 6 that those of you who
pre-ordered the note 4 wished you would
have waited so we couldn't do this
week's show without talking about the
unboxing that Josh did of the Sony
Xperia z3 and it looks gorgeous but it
is just a little bit of a spec bump from
the sea to the Sony Xperia z3 features a
2.5 gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon 801
processor the audrina 330 GPU a 5.1
5-inch 1080p display 3 gigabytes of ram
the 20.7 megapixel rear facing camera 4k
video capture it has digital noise
cancellation a 2
point one megapixel front-facing camera
16 gigabytes of internal storage 4G LTE
support it is water and dust-resistant
and of course comes with four point four
point four KitKat the front of the
device brings minimal bezels on the
sides and a good thumb hold size bezel
on the top and bottom housing some newly
designed speaker grilles a simple Sony
label adorns the top of the bezel in the
center pushing the front-facing camera
sensor off to the right-hand side the
clean look takes none of your attention
away from that gorgeous display now what
I found interesting is that the z3 is
reportedly to have upwards of 10 hours
of on-screen battery time that's pretty
impressive make sure you want to check
out Joss's unboxing and the review to
come very soon now we have some news for
those of you anticipating Android L it
turns out that L will not stand for life
saver as I hoped but lollipop Android al
has some noticeable cosmetic changes
first there's the navigation icons
although they still look like they're
bored from a PlayStation controller they
are now smaller in size and more spaced
out when compared to the previous build
at the top status bar there's also
changes such as solid icons no breaks
for Wi-Fi signals etc and a clock with a
bold smaller Roboto font thanks for
watching a droid army my name is Jace
love to connect with you right here on
Google+ or Twitter I wanted to remind
you again that I still get a lot of
questions via google hangouts or private
messages about Google+ that's really
difficult for me to respond to because
there's a lot of them and only one
person is going to hear the response
whereas if you post them in the comments
below everyone reads them I read them
and everyone can read my response if I'm
able to do so but an even better
solution is to go with your questions to
android authority forums there's a lot
of very knowledgeable people there who
are happy to help you now don't forget
to connect with me here on Google+ or
Twitter and you want to check out my
brothers in android / they're all
working really hard to deliver the best
content on the web I shall see you next
week on Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
