name is Cathy a tech ninja and today
we're gonna take a first look at the HTC
ei8 now the first thing you notice when
you get your hands on the HTC e8 is the
material it doesn't feel like normal
plastic or that soft touch plastic as
seen on the Nexus 7 but it uses a
polycarbonate material and it gives it a
soft and smooth surface now I'm not
going to do a full comparison between
the m8 and I ain't here since I'll be
doing a full video on that later on but
comparing it to the m8 it feels just as
solid the soft touch material allows you
to seamlessly slide your finger from the
back of the device to the screen without
any type of change in service it
honestly feels like one big smooth
material the device is two-tone where
the accent color is on the back the
model that I have has the gold accents
and you'll see the go around the lens
flash power button and actually on the
HTC logo now one thing that is different
is that the power button is located in
the middle on the top of the device and
quietly missing is the IR blaster I'll
be inclined to think that this was an
attempt to keep the device at a lower
price the headphone jack and also the
charging port is located on the bottom
of the device the volume rocker and dual
SIM is located on the right hand side
and on the left side you'll find the SD
card slot the front of the device looks
like other HTC's from the past few years
dual speakers on the front and a
front-facing camera on the top and now
speaking of the cameras HTC went away
from the ultra pixel dual cameras and
went with a more traditional 13
megapixel shooter on the back and does
it improve picture quality I'm not too
sure that it does but this is a nice
start now the rest of the specs are the
same as the m8 16 gigabytes internal
memory 2 gigabytes of RAM and Snapdragon
801 and the Adreno 330 GPU the 5-inch
screen has 1080p resolution with a 441
PPI pixel density now just like other
HTC devices the colors are very
saturated now beyond the color the Texas
extremely crisp as well and also the
viewing angles allows you to see all the
fine details software-wise is sporting
4.4.2 and since six using blinkfeed and
if you're not familiar with blinkfeed
this is a Flipboard style news and
social aggregator you can access from
the launcher by sliding to the left and
it brings in your latest news based on
your interests and also Facebook and
Google+ posts now as far as performance
it feels just like any other flagship
device it's not much shutter between
applications and games run really smooth
I was able to play dead trigger 2 with
the highest graphics setting all the way
up with the controller with minimal lag
thanks to the ndrina on 330 GPU and this
phone should go toe-to-toe with any
other Android smartphone on the market
right now a lot of HTC fans have been
praying and hoping for an m8 that is
more affordable for everyone this one
could be the one for you

full review is coming up later this week
