handy the Android authority app guy and
it's Friday so you know what that means
we have a lot of PC gaming related news
this week and a whole lot more so let's
get started first up this week is a new
PC emulator for Android that lets you
play old PC games
it's called exagear and mod is rather
complicated to use it looks like
something that could be pretty fun to
play it is a PC emulator for old PC
games which means no games actually come
with it it's been optimized for a few
titles including Civilization 3 and it
is a bit pricey at about 14 dollars when
you add everything up it'll be hit or
miss with a lot of people but the
concept is really cool
so apparently Facebook is about ready to
sever their messaging app from their
regular app I personally dislike this
move because I'm not a fan of Facebook's
messaging platform so the idea of having
to download two apps just to maintain
functionality on something I barely use
is not very palatable
however Facebook maintains they're doing
it so the messaging service can't
improve more on Android the change
should be happening soon so you might as
well download the messenger app now
leave it to Google to not let anything
go to waste the Google i/o 2014
application has been repurposed as a
tutorial app instead of letting the
application die off Google instead
updated the application to the latest
material design standard and then
release the code along with some
documentation and reference materials so
that developers can use it as a base for
their material design apps the code from
the app shows a lot of great examples so
if you're an app dev you should probably
hop on that Google now received an
update this last week and now it knows
which hotel you're staying at the new
functionality is pretty much based on
that once Google determines what hotel
you're staying at Google now can deliver
recommendations in the area around the
hotel this is a great new feature for
pretty much anyone who travels and it
can be good if you're vacationing in an
area you don't know very well it can
also give you directions to your hotel
from anywhere in case you get lost there
our last bit of news this week Morrowind
may be showing up on android sometime in
the future the port has been
successfully installed on Android
devices but the performance is abysmal
for the time being developers are
working on it and so far the progress
has been described as impressive and
quick by those who have been following
along this is exciting because morrowind
was a huge and popular game and seeing
it on an android TV would just rock
so who wants to see some trending
applications as usual if you want to
check any of these applications out you
can find the links in the written
companion which is in the video
description below
the venerable SwiftKey got a huge update
this last week that includes bug fixes
and a whole bunch of much-needed
performance improvements for
translations typing loading times and
flow performance it doesn't include any
new features but the list of things that
it does improve on with this release is
simply impressive and don't forget that
SwiftKey is now free so if you haven't
tried it yet to climb up from under that
rock and join the rest of us journal is
a fun new application that allows you to
keep a diary or a journal on your
smartphone it comes with some standard
writing features along with some more
unique ones like syncing your journal
across devices using Google Drive there
are n app purchases but unless you plan
on printing any journal entries out or
backing up your journal to local storage
you should be able to use this unique
journal application entirely free Mirage
is a new application that has similar
functionality to snapchat as well as
Facebook's version which is called
slingshot they claim to fame for this
camera messaging service is that
everything is completely unrecorded you
send stuff but it never gets recorded
anywhere on a server you can also
interact with all of your contacts and
not just the one signed up for specific
social media services it's free to use
with no in-app purchases so why not give
it a try wolf link bubble got a pretty
substantial update this last week
included his Android wear support
Android L support and improved
functionality for notifications and
incognito mode for those who may not
know link bubble is a unique web browser
that uses floating notifications to let
you browse the web instead of the usual
full-screen mode it's a pretty awesome
application and you should definitely
try it out last up this week is peek the
fun lockscreen application allows people
to interact with their notifications on
their lock screens in a more efficient
manner received a pretty big update this
last week it now includes support for
Android 4.3 devices and improved and
setup process and the boilerplate bug
fixes and performance improvements if
you're running Android 4.3 you should
definitely check this one out because
