hindi from android authority comm and
the flavor of the year has been personal
assistance in this shootout we're going
to compare five of the most popular
personal assistants including Google
Assistant Bixby Cortana Alexa and Siri
okay let's start with the very basics
all five of these personal assistants
have a lot in common
you can access them with the press of a
button most of them are built into their
various operating systems they all can
fetch information and do web searches
they also all have base apps or
dedicated homescreen pages that allow
additional info like weather news
reminders and other stuff as well as
settings the basic experience is very
similar between all five personal
assistants that said there are some
things that you need to know each
assistant works best with its individual
ecosystem Google assistant works best
with Google Apps chromecast Google home
and all of that jazz Alexa works best
with fire tablets Amazon streaming
services fire sticks and the echo
devices you get where I'm going with
this choosing a personal assistant
generally means that you're also
choosing the apps and devices that they
support as well thus I can probably save
you a bunch of time if you're firmly
ensconced in an ecosystem your best bet
is to just stick with the assistant that
works best with that ecosystem Siri
doesn't work well with Gmail Cortana
doesn't play well with YouTube Google
assistant works well with a variety of
features but you still get the best
results with Google Play Music or Google
keep that's just the way it is for right
now so let's get right to the questions
I'm going to make this really quick and
simple because you don't have all day
and neither do i if at any point you see
an assistant open a web search or simply
not complete the command they have
failed that round the assistants should
be able to complete all of these
commands with something other than a web
search we also tested each of these
assistants on their home turf and that's
why you'll see Cortana being tested on a
laptop additionally I'm not great at
recording device audio I apologize in
advance if it sounds a little worse than
usual okay let's get started okay let's
start with some basic easy questions
these were the challenging questions
like four years ago and they definitely
aren't any more there is no excuse for
an assistant app to not be able to
complete these ok assistant what's the
weather right now
looks like it's a cloudy day when the
temperature of 61 right now in Columbus
at 61 and cloudy today it'll be partly
cloudy with a forecasted high of 73 and
a low of 51 it's 61 degrees with cloudy
skies today you can look for partly
sunny weather with a high of 75 degrees
and a low of 53 degrees okay here's the
weather for today the forecast shows
mostly sunny skies with a high of 71 and
a low of 53 okay assistant what was the
score of the last Browns game the Browns
most recent game was against the Giants
the score was 10 to 6 Browns but one day
the Browns beat the Giants 10 to 6 he'll
play tomorrow and 7:30 p.m. away against
the book of year
the Browns narrowly defeated the Giants
by his fourth 10 to 6 last Monday on
Monday the brown squeaked by the Giants
10 to 6 okay assistant tell me a joke
we're just spiders go on the internet
their favorite web site okay here you go
why do fish live in saltwater because
pepper water makes them a sneeze
why is Candice light-colored you've got
to keep it within the lines I don't
think you'd understand a joke in my
language they're not so funny anyway why
with the calendar nervous its days were
numbered okay assistant when is the next
solar eclipse
according to earth sky you can see that
after the August 21st 2017 eclipse the
next total eclipse for North America
will come on April 8th 2024 it will
happen February 15th 2018 according to
community members on April 8th 2024 a
total solar
oops well once again across the country
it will come up from Mexico through
Texas and on to New York and Maine
finally leaving land in Newfoundland
okay assistant when is the next showing
of spider-man homecoming on the web the
next few showings of spider-man
homecoming at Marcos cross would cinema
are at 10 a.m.
105 p.m. and for 10 p.m. it's also
showing it rave cinemas Polaris 18 plus
extreme in AMC East and Towne Center 30
with dine in theaters and IMAX here are
a few theaters playing spider me today I
found spider-man homecoming a bit far
from you all five assistants performed
very well you will almost always find
what you are looking for Bixby appeared
to struggle with direct commands unless
you feed at the proper context however
if a question doesn't work on big speed
you can actually order to open Google
search and perform the exact same search
there thus piggybacking on Google's
excellent responses it's a cheap
workaround but it does work we also got
two different answers for the Eclipse
question but technically neither of them
are wrong the next one in the u.s. is in
2024 while the next one in the entire
world is in 2018 this is a wash because
2024 answers were correct in the context
that I live in the United States and the
assistants assumed that's the one I
wanted to know however the 2018 date is
actually the factually accurate answer
you can always specify more to get the
most accurate answers these commands are
all simple tasks that you shouldn't have
any trouble completing generally
speaking these are native commands that
require either no third-party apps to
complete or very obvious nearly
ubiquitous third-party apps that they
all should have support for okay
assistant set a reminder to pick up milk
from the store when do you want to be
reminded tomorrow at noon
okay do you want to save this yes okay
reminder saved reminders are not
currently supported on this device okay
I'll remind you got it okay assistant
play Pink Floyd's time on YouTube here
you go here's what I have here are some
videos of time by Pink Floyd I found on
the web
sorry I can't play music on YouTube okay
assistant open up the web browser
your silk sure thing
opening Google Chrome okay assistant
what's on my calendar sure thing here's
your calendar here are the events you
requested first up you have a calendar
entry on August 30th at 12:00 p.m. the
title is paid a hero the next four
events on Wednesday August 30th at 12:00
p.m. there's pay day on Monday September
4th
there's Labor Day which lasts all day on
Wednesday September 6 and 12:00 p.m.
there's payment removed from bank today
and on Wednesday September 20th
there's mom's birthday which lasts all
day ok I found at least 25 appointments
sure I can help you find something on
the calendar here's your schedule for
today ok assistant show me directions
from Cleveland Ohio to Las Vegas Nevada
alright it looks like the distance is
2074 miles on your trip we'll tape
around one day six hours by car you can
say start to begin the navigation
alright the best way to get from
Cleveland to Las Vegas by car is via
i-80 west and will take about one day in
six hours in light traffic the fastest
route to Las Vegas takes about 31 hours
48 minutes via i-70 and i-15 getting
directions from Cleveland to Las Vegas
sure getting you directions to Las Vegas
Nevada
overall none of the assistants did
overly bad alexis saw some struggles
including a lack of support for youtube
which is the world's most popular video
streaming service Alexa does have
YouTube support on devices like echo
though other than that all five devices
perform admirably YouTube support is
surprisingly not great Bixby and Google
assistant had no troubles but the other
three did and I can't really explain why
everybody uses YouTube and not having
support is just a little bit silly Bixby
Google assistant and Siri do get some
extra credit for being able to complete
multiple tasks at once they were able to
do things like open web browsers to a
specific web address where as the other
two could not the only assistant that
didn't struggle in at least one category
to some extent was Google assistant our
final set of questions represent hard
mode these are complex tasks that almost
certainly require third party
integration of some type this is the
bleeding edge of what these assistants
can accomplish and this is also the
functionality that's going to expand the
most over the next couple of years okay
assistant turn my lights on
sure turning the bookshelf on okay okay
the bookshelf is on I'm sorry for the
quality of the audio my setup is
upstairs filming the result of this
assuming it works so this is an Xbox one
there you go see
Xbox there's my gamertag and all that so
I'm relatively certain I can make
philips hue lights turn on using Cortana
on the Xbox one so here we go hey
Cortana turn on lights okay there are
two small Corrections here big speed
does actually work with Philips hue
lights however you have to order this
fifty dollar Samsung smartthings hub in
order to do so it's simply not worth it
if you have only a couple of smart home
things and it kind of sucks that samsung
put something like this behind a paywall
additionally Cortana does not have
native support for philips hue I used a
third-party application called hue TRO
which just so happened to work on both
the Xbox one and Windows 10 okay
assistant track my next run starting
running
please visit Amazon to track or manage
your orders I'll need to access your
intervals data to do that it ok
I started your work work
ok assistant called me an uber
destination
let's check the details and request for
a ride uber isn't supported on this
device there is an uber at 7 minutes
away from your Alexa address should I
order it no thank you
have a nice day what type of ride you
want Boober X uber can get you an uber X
in seven minutes do you want to request
it
no thank you okay I won't request it
okay assistant order me a pizza I found
a few places within eight point nine
miles dude like to place your easy order
reorder your most recent order or start
a new order start a new order great
let's get started is this order for
delivery or carryout
carryout Thanks you can tell me what
you'd like to order or I can tell you
about our menu what would you like one
large pepperoni pizza what type of crust
do you want you can choose hand-tossed
crunchy thin crust or Oakland style
Brooklyn style your order contains one
pizza
the total is $14.49 would you like to
review your order details or are you
ready to checkout checkout by placing
this order you agree to our terms of use
available on Domino's calm your order
should be ready for pickup in about 13
to 18 minutes do you want me to place
the order no thank you you're welcome
please tell me if there is anything else
I can help you with
I found 15 pizzeria restaurants tap the
one you're looking for
okay assistant download an app for me
opening Play Store
here's what I found
okay searching for Wunderlist on the App
Store this one is tough because a lot of
these require complicated setups or have
other limitations for instance Siri
can't order a pizza but only in certain
parts of the world
Google assistant can hail an uber and
order pizza but only on Google's home we
wanted to show that these difficult
tasks could be done but also that this
is the bleeding edge and you won't
always have access to these features
functionality is generally unstable or
incomplete but promising on all five
assistants to some extent Cortana can
turn on philips hue lights on Xbox one
even if I had to cut out the eight
failed attempts to due to instability
it's a real pain that Siri and Google
assistant could have done better if
their feature rollout were more
consistent in respect to region and
device overall Alexa performed the best
in this category failing and only one
question and it Excel despite being used
on a cheap underpowered POS tablets
alright folks you've hung in there this
long it's time to decide a winner and
get on with our day Google assistant is
exceptional at context one of the
drawbacks of most other personal
assistant apps is that you have to get
the command just right in order to
complete the task
Google assistant is very good at
figuring out what you need even if you
ask it do the same thing in two entirely
different ways however we are vastly
disappointed that Google home gets all
of the fun features like casting video
ordering pizza hailing uber and other
stuff while their devices don't it's the
best all-around pick even if we have to
wait for those awesome features to be
available on our phones Amazon Alexa is
probably the most customizable assistant
here it doesn't do much out of the box
but you can install these things called
skills that increase functionality
dramatically
I had to install several of these skills
over the course of the making of this
video
and most of them worked really well
additionally Alexa excels at gathering
information through conversation in
order to complete a task like ordering a
pizza when it comes to pure
functionality Alexa can do more than all
of the other personal assistants and
Alexa enable devices work exceptionally
well with one another it just sucks that
so few devices habits and that Amazon's
Android experience is vastly inferior to
Google's Android experience but Alexa
did
Pizza and none of the other ones did so
kudos to Alexa Siri did surprisingly
well during every round of this test
Apple has been doing well with keeping
Siri competitive with everybody else and
Siri feels like a solid option it also
has exceptional backwards compatibility
I perform this test on a
first-generation iPad air and I know it
did just as well as the latest iPhone
would have done considering that the
pixel excel on android oreo doesn't even
do as well as google's home device I got
to give Apple credit for delivering
consistency between older and newer
devices Siri may not be the best choice
but it is a safe choice especially if
you're stuck on an older Apple device
that still gets consistently updated
you're not going to be disappointed
unless you need something
it specifically can't do Cortana's
biggest strength is being available
freakin everywhere like Starbucks or
political dissonance iOS Android Windows
10 and Xbox one means that it's
available on more devices than every
other personal assistant and it's not a
close measurement you can't get any
other personal assistant application on
your phone your computer and your gaming
system at the same time it's accessible
to third-party developers although that
potential is almost wholly untapped it's
quickly falling behind when it comes to
third-party integration and more
advanced tasks Cortana has more
potential than any assistant here
however Microsoft really needs to step
up their game a lot because their
assistant is kidding rekt right now and
that brings us to the wild card with
Bixby Bixby did a surprisingly good job
during testing and where it excels the
most is feeling like an actual personal
assistant when it performs tasks it has
the ability to emulate screen taps like
an actual freaking person and that lets
it interact with on-screen elements
better than any other assistant its
unrivaled for boring mundane tasks like
rotating images in your gallery
downloading apps cleaning out your
browser history and a lot more it's
really too bad that you could only have
this on a few devices and that it's home
automation features are stuck behind a
50-dollar proprietary Samsung hub it
still needs a lot of work though
especially in his tertiary features such
as big speed vision it's better than
Cortana and at least as good as Siri of
course we'd love to hear what you think
as well drop a comment and let us know
which one you use and why and that about
does it for this one folks don't forget
to subscribe to Android Authority and
ring the bell to get the latest android
authority videos as
soon as they're released thanks again
for watching everybody and have a
wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
