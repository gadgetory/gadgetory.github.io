came with the HTC One m8 now comes with
the HTC One m9 with a little bit more
customization available and a little bit
more functionality underneath this is
Joshua reguar from Android authority
what's going on everybody and this is a
look at the updated dot view case for
the HTC One m9 especially if you are
familiar with the original dot view case
from the HTC One m8 there actually isn't
too much that you have to say here other
than the fact that there are quite a few
other colors and now that the back is
available in a translucent fashion now
you'll be able to show off the back of
the HTC One m9 and not cover it up with
just a plain color on the back also
these particular cases have less of a
soft touch feel to them which is
something that I thought was a bit of a
bummer because they feel a little bit
more heart plasticky and thus not really
quite as premium as the dive view case
from the previous edition but that being
said you still have all of the dots on
the front that will cover the screen and
a small magnet inside of the case will
trigger the smart cover capabilities
when you open up the case you will be
able to turn on the screen quite easily
but it is when the case is closed that
you have all of the functionality coming
underneath the same gestures that are
used when bringing the motion of the
phone up to your face and then double
tapping on the screen are available here
even just swiping to the left and right
or even down in order to trigger the
voice recording for example but double
tapping on there will bring you a quick
look at your notifications and give you
a nice looking background to boots now
this is not necessarily new in the dot
view case and is definitely a
functionality that is quite nice to have
when you have a case on here that's
supposed to protect it and also be able
to bring you a little bit of
functionality as well but from there
there is actually a dot view case
application that we saw in the one m9
that has been updated to provide a
little bit more customization when it
comes to your experience with this
particular case one in particular is the
ability to theme the notifications that
you get I changed the background for
example behind the clock that is at the
top and then be able to see a nice
little pattern or coloration that
customizes the look of your notification
screen a few apps have been thrown into
the mix as well especially one in
particular that is a nice marquee effect
and of course I wrote Android authority
on there and you can see here that it is
a scrolling past
all of the dots on this particular
device and on this particular case the
dot view case comes in a number of
different colors and as I said before
the backs can be translucent if you want
to show off the backing of the HTC One
m9 which is already pretty nice but if
you want to cover it up and get a
completely different color or look for
your phone you can always get the ones
that have a solid backing pictured here
are the gray yellow and blue versions
and there are some other ones as well
even a Pinker version available so that
is the dot view case for the HTC One m9
just a little way for you to not only
protect your phone but also customize it
in a number of different ways while
still getting your notifications through
a very nice and unique way through the
dots on the front this is Josh reguar

coverage of the HTC One m9 and more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
