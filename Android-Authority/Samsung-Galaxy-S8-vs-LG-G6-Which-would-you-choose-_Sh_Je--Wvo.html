have your eyes on and for good reason
feature for feature you can't find a
better combination than the two phones
you see here but which one of these
phones comes out on top
well Fitch jaja Vergara what's going on
everybody and we will explore that
question in this the Samsung Galaxy s8
versus the LG G six for the full stories
and specifications on either of these
phones remember that you can watch my
full review of the galaxy s 8 or Lon's
review of the LG G 6 here at Android
authority in this versus video I will be
providing my own opinions but remember
that this is also a discussion let us
know which one you would pick and why in
the comments below at first glance the
Galaxy S a is the phone that causes a
double take samsung managed to pack a
large screen onto a body that feels and
looks pretty damn slim compared this to
the LG g 6 which is a bit more generic
LG's phone is also slightly thicker
which adds to its bulk while the s8 shed
space bezel and hand gymnastics through
a wonderfully crafted curved display but
that doesn't take away from what LG has
achieved this year a return to form more
focused on getting the details right
rather than experimenting to failure the
way the g5 did but when you're looking
for a phone that turns heads the Galaxy
S a is definitely the one to grab just
hold on tight because regardless of
which one you choose the glass on glass
design on either phone can slip out
pretty easily the Galaxy s8 also takes
the screen to the next level curving the
sides from minimal bezels and better
handling LG still dies into the 18 by 9
aspect ratio gracefully however
minimizing its bezels as much as it can
without fancy glass bending the result
is a lack of buttons on the front of
either device though the s8 smartly
hides a haptic feedback version below
its screen both also have good always-on
displays but LG's version on this LCD
remains pretty stagnant while the
Samsung iteration is more customizable
provides a little more info and benefits
from the AMOLED display so in terms of
design and display the Galaxy S a is
clearly ahead of the curve managing to
be a sleek piece of tech while providing
the large screen experience and for a
lot of users this combination might be
the reason to go for Samsung the spec
hungry will also gravitate to the galaxy
because of the Snapdragon 835 the slight
bump up over the LG G 6 we actually
don't see much of a gap between
these two phones in everyday use the
galaxy sa is richer and software
features and let's face it
redundant applications when compared to
the g6 which runs a little bit leaner
battery life is also a bit of a toss-up
between these two as the LG G 6 has a
slight bump up on the Galaxy S a in
battery capacity putting it at 5 hours
of screen on time consistently while the
s8 gets 4.5 hours we do have to call out
the one hardware and design choice that
has frustrated nearly any user in
Android authorities ranks the galaxy s
8s fingerprint sensor yes you can use
the iris scanner in place of it but that
still takes a little more time than the
simply located g6 sensor just lay your
finger down on that little circle on the
back of the LG G 6 and you good to go
now a couple weeks back I talked about
dual cameras and why I thought they were
a wonderful addition to any current
smartphone so it should be no surprise I
think the LG G 6 inches out the SI in
this one category that's not to say that
the s8 has a bad camera by any means
there's just a little more fun to be had
with the G sixes wide-angle secondary
lens every shot that the Galaxy s8
captures can be made a little more
dramatic with that action cam like
perspective and it remains one of the
funnest aspects of the LG phone not to
mention LG did a great job of fitting
its camera interface on this super wide
angle screen of course the s8 still has
a few options of its own one I like in
particular is the front-facing camera
being able to do 2k video but turn the
g6 around and take what we call a wide
fee and the photos and video become much
more interesting
it's great to have the wide-angle for
stuff like this car meet and having
everything in the frame including Panya
city hall for children bugs looking for
a great secondary shooter you can't go
wrong either way but if you want a
little more choice and control over your
shots that have fixed the lens just fall
short of providing the g6 is definitely
the more capable companion and finally
to top it all off we can simply say that
the SI continues the galaxy legacy of
super feature heavy software Samsung's
UI has managed to pack everything in a
great-looking home screen interface but
it still takes a bit of time to dive
into the deep settings menus and find
what every setting lies to a much lesser
extent the LG G 6 has its own W features
that doesn't go out of its way to really
change the tried-and-true Android
workflow Google assistant is prominent
and LG's own applications are gradually
getting mixed in favor of Google's first
party offerings which leads us to big
speak Samsung's answer to smart
assistants the worst part about doing
this comparison now is the fact that
bigsby is basically still in the oven
bixby vision in the camera is a neat
addition that is great for wine reviews
and for now not too much else and Bixby
home is a nice looking home splash
screen that probably won't convert loyal
users of Google now and Bixby voice
right now is only available to people in
Korea with the release date in America
and the general west still up in the air
for the full premium price on carriers
both phones are virtually neck-and-neck
and overall desirability Samsung has
made one of the best designed big screen
phones ever but LG continues to kill it
with its cameras samsung's feature scent
is bonkers as usual but Bigsby only
further proves how redundant to Google
they're really becoming as a vlogger and
shutterbug my pick does go to the g6 but
I will admit that the Galaxy s8 is a bit
of a triumph it comes down to what your
needs are which is why I want you to
remember to sound off in the comments
