authority now I'm sure you've had a
conversation with some good at the
camera in your smartphone and they've
asked you both how many megapixels is it
now while that's an important thing to
us if not the only thing we should be
asking about our smartphone cameras so
the question before us today is how the
smartphone cameras work on what are the
important attributes well let me explain
so a quick recap on how cameras work
there's an out of light in a scene that
you want to take a photograph of whether
it's indoors or outdoors and that light
enters into your camera via a lens
behind the lens there is an aperture
which is basically a hole that lets the
light through to the sensor that's
behind it and it can be very to be
bigger or to be smaller and once it gets
through to the sensor there is a way of
exposing the center for a certain amount
of time to the light to expose it too
much the picture will be all white if
your expose enough the picture will be
all black now in a DLSR or an SLR that
would be with an actual physical shutter
with a smartphone basically the sensor
is switched on for a certain amount of
time to capture and then switched off
again and once all that data has been
captured wet light information is then
sent to an image signal processor an isp
which will take all that information and
turn it into a jpg photo according to
various color profiles and will also
apply maybe some post-processing like
HDR now there is an analogy to this
which you'll find for example on the
Cambridge in color photo tutorial
website we talked about how if you want
to capture some rain now the amount of
rain that's pouring down at the sky at
any one moment is outside of your
control however if you want to capture
some water in a bucket there are certain
things that you do have in your control
for example the size of the bucket the
bigger the bucket the more rain will
enter into it you can also decide how
long you leave the bucket outside and of
course you are able to measure how much
water you have captured and applying
this idea to photographs the width the
size of the bucket is the same as the
aperture how much rain you're able to
get in how much light is able to get
into the sensor the duration that you
leave it out there is
as the shutter speed and of course the
ISO tells you how much sensitivity there
is how has the ability there is in
capturing that water so let's start with
the lens so when you read about lenses
you'll read a thing about the focal
length and that's normally expressed in
millimeters so on a DLSR for example
this camera that I'm using to record
with now has an 18 to 55 millimeter lens
that's the focal length now on a wide
camera a wide shot is somewhere like 18
20 23 and a zoomed in shot would be much
more like 200 250 300 so the focal
length basically defines how wound in
you are on a particular thing I want the
light has gone through the lens we
arrive at the aperture now the larger
the aperture the more light that's able
to get in and having that large amount
of light getting in also affects what's
called the depth of field the bigger the
aperture the narrower the depth of field
if you want to get take some of those
photos where the background is blurry
and the subject is in crisp focus then
you need a wide aperture now you'll see
that written on sometimes on the
specifications about a phone an F 1.7
lens that tells you that's the widest
that it can open now here the strange
thing about focal length the smaller the
number the bigger the hole its inverse
so 1.7 means a bigger hole and 8 means a
small hole now if you go over to the
article that accompanies this particular
video there's a whole bunch of details
about how the focal length and how the
aperture work together to give you those
numbers but if you just want to know the
basics the bigger the hole the more
light they can get in but the shallower
the depth of field and the smaller the
number means the bigger the hole F 1.7
big F 1.5 big f8 means small now once
the light has gone through the aperture
it then gets to the sensor and there is
a way of controlling how long the sensor
is exposed to that light and that's
using the shutter speed whether it be a
physical shutter or an electronic
shutter now basically if you're in a
bright sunny day and you've got the
aperture open wide then you only want
the sensor to be exposed for just a
moment to that amount of light but if
you're in a low light situation
Asian or maybe if you've got the
aperture smaller because you want a
greater depth of field then you have to
let these sensor be exposed for a longer
amount of time now the problem with long
exposures is we can't hold cameras very
very still and that means you get camera
shake now of course there are ways
around this use a tripod that's one
thing there's optical image
stabilization in some smart phones
that's another thing but at the end of
the day the longer the exposure time the
longer the slow the shutter speed then
the more shape is going to be in your
photos now that's not always a bad thing
if you've seen those photos of kind of
car lights that have been captured at
nighttime the red streaming up the road
then that's because unless the shutter
open for a long time with a small
aperture and therefore only a little bit
of light is getting in but it's able to
trace those car tails as they go through
the city but if you have to do that one
a tripod try to do it by hand then
they'll all be shaky all over the place
so a slow ship speed isn't it's really
bad but for a quick snap you need to be
aware that you want a quick shutter
speed and then of course the light gets
through to the sensor itself now the
sensor can be tuned to have a certain
amount of sensitivity and that's tuned
in the same way as film used to be tuned
with an ISO number iso 100 iso 400 iso
800 and that basically means how
sensitive it was that photographic paper
to light and now how sensitive is the
sensor to light now basically
sensitivity means how much is there a
difference between one level of british
satellite and another if there is a big
difference between the different color
shades then that means that there is
going to be lots of crisp details
however if there was a small distance
then any kind of variation in the light
will produce a variation in the color
and what actually happens when you go
way to the other extreme maybe you start
to get up to 1600 3200 and even higher
than what you actually get is you get
noise in the picture because the camera
can't really tell the difference between
one bit of light and another bit of
light and it seems their two shades of
grey two shades of red and your picture
starts will expect all they start to
look dirty because the color isn't
uniform so that's a danger of high ISO
speeds they introduce noise into the
pictures and then the sensor itself has
a physical dimension
the sensors in maybe in DLSR cameras or
in other compact cameras might be for
example 35 millimeter is the biggest
that comes back to the idea of when we
had film and then you might have the
Micro Four Thirds system for example and
then down in a camera you they called
like 1 over 2.5 inches I won't go into
this now in each mean 16 millimetres of
course is not this again is a hangover
from an old days of lenses and cameras
but basically it's like one over to half
an inch one over 2.5 one over three a
third of an inch and that shows you that
it is quite small now the smaller the
sensor the less light it can capture
that's obvious but this is where
megapixels come in if you have many many
many megapixels packed into a very very
tiny sensor then each of those pixels
can only pick up a fraction of that
light well in fact the size of the
sensor divided by the number of pixels
there are now if you have less
megapixels and a bigger individual pixel
size then each individual pixel is able
to capture more light if you go too big
without increasing the sensor size then
the camera will start to produce more
noisy pictures and it won't have the the
resolution in terms of light and that's
when people start to talk about it's got
a 1.4 or 1.7 micrometer pixel size so
this is an interesting things that
people manufactures are now talking
about how big are those individual
pixels now if you go up to a big camera
like a DLSR or a Micro Four Thirds
system out of that and of course you got
a much bigger sensor and there if you've
got a 20 megapixel or a 21 megapixel
camera that's much of a different game
than it is if you have 21 megapixels in
a small camera on a small sensor and
once that light has been captured by the
camera is passed over to the ISP the
image signal processor and companies
like our make an image signal processor
for their customers Qualcomm have their
own image signal processor in their
Snapdragon chip and basically it's
responsible for taking all that data and
producing the JPEG file and some cameras
it can produce a raw file it has to
apply the color profile
has to do any post processing like HDR
and that it all handled inside of the
ISP and I have other quick things to
talk about one is autofocus the picture
needs to be focused and there are
different methods for doing autofocus
including a dual pixel method including
phase detection if you go over to the
article that accompanies this video
you'll see more details on how these
different auto focus systems work and
finally let's mention dual cameras if
you look at the phone at the LGG sic
what LG have done is they've put in
lenses with two different focal lengths
one with a wider one and one with a more
standard one and that means it's able to
have options when it comes to taking
photos you look at a system like the
wild wave p10 then that's using two
senses one monochrome one color and the
isp is able to take the data from the
monochrome sensor and really double up
the amount of light that's coming into
the picture particularly good for when
you're doing things like HDR or your in
low-light situations now I'd like to see
more dual camera systems on smartphones
I think it's a good way to compensate
for the particularly small sensor size
and the limitations that we have in
having such small lenses I think dual
cameras is the way to go however we
noticed that Samsung didn't put that in
the f/8 this year so we interesting to
see what we get further down the road
from companies like Samsung
