9 and I've been feeling like a boss sure
it was a bit of an expense a bit of a
splurge but you're not gonna get those
kinds of specs without spending that
kind of money well that is unless you
get yourself a poco phone f1 you guys
have been really interested in this
phone and for good reason because it
basically has a $1,000 spec sheet for
more like $300 though why did I spend so
much money on a note 9 look this might
have the same specs on paper but there's
no way this thing's going to perform as
well as a note 9 in the real world wait
so the poco phone f1 actually has better
performance in benchmarks than the
Galaxy Note 9 now granted I'm using the
British Galaxy Note 9 with the Exynos
processor not the Snapdragon but still
this is really impressive poco phone is
an offshoot of Xiaomi a company that's
well known for crafting devices with
specs that belie their low prices of
course the way to achieve this is by
making compromises and cutting corners
elsewhere normally where the
manufacturers hope you won't go to
notice they are gambling that customers
will value the raw specs more than those
additional flagship luxury this way the
poco phone f1 manages to bring a
snapdragon 845 with 6 gigabytes of RAM
and 64 gigabytes of storage for around -
just $300 there are also variants that
come with 8 2 gigabytes of RAM and 128
or 256 gigabytes of storage
there's even a 4000 million power
battery in here so just what are those
compromises and how much do they hurt
the overall experience
so looking at it right away you can see
that this isn't a premium flagship
device it doesn't have the unibody glass
and metal frame that those really
expensive thousand-dollar phones have
however it has a polycarbonate ie
plastic back and it's actually not that
bad of course it's not as premium as
weighty feeling as a glass phone but it
brings its own advantages plastic back
phones aren't as fingerprint e they're
not like to break if you drop them and
actually it's got a nice finish on it
it's nice and smooth and I think it's
quite cool I personally don't think it
looks or feels cheap it's lighter but I
felt much worse there's also a Kevlar
Edition which is awesome because that's
what bat
seat is made out of coal quality is
absolutely fine and I have no problems
with reception you do get a headphone
jack and there's a very speedy
fingerprint sensor around the back and
it's USB type-c so none of this micro
USB crap
it also supports quick charge 4.0 and
has a basic splash resistance thanks to
a company called 2p to I that provided a
nano coating process just don't take it
in the bath with you there's no wireless
charging or IP rating but on the whole
this phone offers more than you expect
for the price in terms of these added
comforts the screen is a six-point 18
inch full HD IPS LCD display there's a
notch which might be a bummer for some
and it's also a strangely large notch
with only a little screen on either side
looks quite similar to the iPhone
actually corners are quite rounded which
is likewise an acquired taste as it cuts
off a bit of screen real estate down the
bottom and at the top it doesn't have
the stunning deep blacks found on
amyloids but it's certainly sharp and
bright enough to be very enjoyable for
consuming media and gaming and there's
dual facing speakers yes you heard right
are also very welcome in both those
scenarios in fact so this is a great
gaming phone all round the performance
is actually superior to that found on a
razer phone thanks to the newer
processor games perform incredibly well
and look crisp on HD display I've even
been able to enjoy a little GameCube
emulation with just about acceptable
performance that's my personal gold
standard when it comes to Android gaming
there's even a water cooling system to
help prevent throttling and overheating
another area where we often see
compromise is the camera department but
again the story isn't half as bad as I
was expecting
for starters you get a dual lens and
rear camera that's used for those bokeh
effects that's a 12 megapixel primary
lens with an F 1.9 aperture and a
secondary 5 megapixel depth sensor and
around the front is an actually rather
impressive 20 megapixel shooter with an
F 2.0 aperture video can be shot at 30
frames per second at to 160 P around the
back and 1080p around the front so how
the photos and videos turn out actually
again not bad when you zoom right in
there's a little detail missing and some
noise creeps in in low-light settings
focusing can sometimes be a little
tricky and contrast could perhaps be a
little higher you're not going to
mistake these pictures for a pixel or a
galaxy but with
said they're also not bad at all in fact
this is probably one of the more
reliable budget cameras I've used
there's good dynamic range pleasing
saturation and the auto mode does a
great job of compensating for different
environments and lighting and there's a
pro mode if you'd rather take matters
into your own hands
having a 20 megapixel front facing
camera is also a very welcome inclusion
comparisons have been made with the 1
plus line and by extension the Nexus
phones this makes sense given that this
is a device that provides excellent
specs for less without much in the way
of bells and whistles that doesn't mean
you'll be getting a completely stock
Android experience though rather the
poco f1 is running the MIUI 9.6 layer on
top of Android 8.1 which does mean a
little bloat and some occasionally
irritating decisions but otherwise
things run smoothly settings away you
expect them to be and it doesn't really
impede matters at all the performance on
this phone means that productivity tasks
and multitasking or a breeze and the
massive batteries put to great use with
some stellar longevity so then the
question becomes why spend more on a
real flagship phone did I waste my money
on the Galaxy Note 9 in my opinion not
really after all the note 9 brings
wireless charging tree water resistance
has a higher res AMOLED curve to display
it has a crazy good camera I'm a tech
reviewer I love all that extra stuff
what I'm trying to say is that the poco
phone f1 doesn't really have its own
thing and it doesn't have that luxurious
feeling of the very top end there's
nothing extra here to make you really
sit up and take notice
other than that price of course and it's
not flashy in any way but that's it the
compromise here isn't so much that the
fundamentals have been half-assed rather
it's just that there isn't anything
additional and that's going to be
perfectly fine for a lot of people this
is a phone that manages to do all the
basics incredibly well as a budget that
makes it very compelling if performance
is your main priority then it's very
hard to beat in its price category stay
tuned to the channel and the site for
more content where I'll be pitting the
poco f1 against the honor play and the
oneplus 6 to see just how disruptive it
really is I've been Adam Shin it's key I
hope you've enjoyed this video review
and found it useful if you did then
please consider leaving a like and
sharing it around that helps us out
immensely comment down below and let us
know what you think of the poco f1 will
you be buying or do you need a little
more pizazz in your devices
