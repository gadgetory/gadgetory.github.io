powered fitness tracker that tries to
take the best of both worlds with a 1.3
inch touchscreen the m600 is IP
certified for waterproofing and the
result is a watch that due to its size
we actually don't feel too comfortable
wearing in more situations than during
exercise also the screen seems just a
little bit too small when compared to
the overall watch's footprint the 500
milliamp hour battery is claimed to last
two days which was basically true in our
usage two physical buttons make up the
tactile experience on top of the full
touchscreen and one of those buttons go
straight into the polar software that
can track specific workouts it uses the
optical heart rate sensor which is
pretty accurate at least compared to
other high-end fitness trackers and all
distance-based activities are tracked
via built-in GPS all the information is
then sent to the polar flow app
installed on any smartphone and used to
sync daily activity and workouts in one
easy to see interface though sleep
tracking is possible using Polar's eco
system it's probably the most simplistic
part of it all otherwise
heartrate information and the
rigorousness of the set activity tracked
by the watch's sensors are put together
to provide an overall snapshot of one's
fitness but this is familiar to anyone
that already uses Polar's method the
main addition is Android wear which is
then familiar to any avid Android users
polar is trying to merge the two
providing their fitness wearable robust
app and notification support and for the
most part we found it effective despite
some bugs that we experienced when
trying to pair the watch to certain
Android smartphones there's plenty that
users can achieve using polar zone
fitness software coupled with apps
downloaded from the Play Store for
example fix the sleep tracking by using
sleep as Android but marrying the two
different worlds of Android wear and
polar comes at a price a hefty one the
barrier of entry is 329 dollars for a
very robust SmartWatch and GPS enabled
fitness tracker it might make sense for
new users due to the watch's effective
nature as a high-end hybrid but for
people already part of the polar
ecosystem we can't really find much
reason to recommend the steep upgrade
for a more in-depth look at the polar
m600 head to Android authority calm for
the full written review by Jimmy
westenberg and myself and then bring it
