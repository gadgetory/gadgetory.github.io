handy the Android authority app guide in
this quick video we're gonna take a look
at the best Android apps and games that
were released in March of 2015 pull my
tree the flash dreamer is a 3d
platformer game with impressive colorful
visuals a fun storyline and challenging
gameplay you play as a hero who has to
try to save a world that is crumbling by
the minutes it's a lot of fun but
doesn't work on devices that use arts
although we imagine that issue is
temporary al-fatiha Genesis 2 is the
latest in the l-fatiha series from Camco
games it is an RPG title that features a
long and decent storyline job classes
decent graphics and a unique UI
experience for a game there are a few
bugs here and there so do be sure to
test it inside of the refund time Auto
where is an Android wear application
that gives you the ability to add some
unique stuff to your Android smart watch
experience some features include
floating icons interactive screen
creation ok Google integration and a
whole lot more if you like to tinker and
don't mind a bit of a learning curve you
can get a 7-day free trial of the
application right now corgi for feedly
is a lock screen replacement application
that puts your feedly newsfeed on the
lock screen it adheres to material
design uses your customisable feedly
feed and also lets you share with
friends it's a simple replacement but it
doesn't have very good lock screen
security and there are a few bugs here
and there
droop is a kind of messaging application
where you can browse your contacts and
message anyone of them using your
preferred messaging service that means
you can get a hold of one person on
Facebook messenger and another on
hangouts all from one application it's
definitely interesting if you use
multiple messaging platforms and it's
free to use the Dungeon Hunter 5 is the
latest iteration of the Dungeon Hunter
series from Gameloft it continues where
Dungeon Hunter 4 left off and includes
improved graphics a new storyline to
play through and some online player
mechanics it's an action RPG that uses a
freemium model but it's still worth a
shot if you like action RPGs Final
Fantasy record-keeper is a dual effort
between DNA and Square Enix the game has
enough nostalgia to where any final
fantasy fan can feel welcome the
gameplay is simple and easy to
understand there are some optimization
issues and the game starts slowly but
pretty much any final fantasy fan can
enjoy this one five nights at Freddy's
is a horror game series that took
Android by storm in 2014 the third in
the series was released in March to
positive reviews from both reviewers and
users it's inexpensive with no in-app
purchases and it's truly a creepy
experience hey can't hurt to pick this
one up photonic ax is an infinite runner
game that uses some unique minimal
graphics and fast speeds there are eight
levels three endless levels local
multiplayer - difficulty settings and it
comes with a cheap affordable price tag
with no in-app purchases it's a fun
little time waster and it's worth
picking up
fun fit is a workout application that
was released by HTC in an effort to get
people into shape it isn't his feature
filled to something like runtastic but
if you need something basic and simple
with a good design then this should be
okay to use
it also includes goals Facebook
integration and more king of thieves is
a time waster out of Zeptolab makers of
the famous Cut the Rope series in this
game you build a base to protect your
gold and then you go and raid other
people for theirs unlike most games with
this dynamic you'll be attacking people
using platformer game mechanics it's
free to play and good for kids or adults
motion tennis cast is a unique game that
uses a chromecast to let you play tennis
on your television screen similar to a
Nintendo Wii game this is definitely one
of the most interesting mobile games
that we've seen in a long time if you
have a chromecast you should definitely
try this one out because it is free to
download nozzle is an application that
helps you keep track of what news your
friends are reading it sounds creepy but
they do mean well it's a way to find
news and topics based on the stuff your
friends are currently reading is totally
free to use so it can't hurt to try it
out that is unless you do not have a
Twitter or Facebook accounts because
then you can't use it the original
zombie highway was one of the best time
wasters on Android and it's day and
zombie high weights who hopes to
continue that tradition it includes more
cars more guns improved graphics more
levels and plenty of objectives to
complete it is a freemium game that you
can do fairly well in without purchasing
anything once again I'm Joe handi the
