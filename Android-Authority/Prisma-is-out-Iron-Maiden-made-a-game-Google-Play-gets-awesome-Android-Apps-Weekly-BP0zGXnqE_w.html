show is brought to you by free mo hello
again ladies and gentleman I'm Joe handy
the Android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly this
is episode number 151 so let's get right
into it alright folks let's take a look
at the headlines that dominated the app
news this week Facebook announced this
week that they have over 1 billion
active daily users that's billion with a
B and that literally outshines
everything else on the internet by a
wide margin
many people have attributed that success
to Facebook's continued focus on mobile
features live video 360-degree content
and more as a result you can expect
Facebook's focus on these things to
continue into the future and their
growth should as well google also
announced that the Google Play Store
will be getting additional categories in
order to help people find applications
more easily this is great news since
most applications are available in
multiple categories already and it's
already pretty confusing there are eight
new categories and a few of them will be
art and design parenting dating and food
and drink to give you an idea of what
they're going to be like Google Play
continued its busy week with a new
algorithm that's said to help lower the
size of updates so they aren't so hard
on your data plan it does this by
allowing the update to only download the
changes which are then merged into the
existing files on your device that way
you don't have to redownload the entire
application every time a new update gets
pushed out this will result in far
smaller downloads and less download
times movies final fantasy is coming out
on August 3rd but we were given the apk
early so we could try it out first our
initial impressions were fairly positive
you'll find that the game has better
graphics than other freemium Final
Fantasy titles however it is still a
freemium game and you'll find all of the
components of one inside of the game
itself it'll be interesting that's for
sure and it'll be out in a few days
the latest Humble Bundle is now live
this week's Run has a bunch of really
good games including ease chronicles
hitman go chameleon run at the Banner
Saga and others you can pay one dollar
to get three of the games beat the
average to get six games or pay six
dollars or more to get every game in the
bundle this is an exceptionally good
