is Jace and this past week we saw some
interesting news from nokia X the
Samsung Galaxy alpha and also some good
news regarding Android one first coming
to Mother India so if you remember a few
weeks ago one of the most interesting
announcements from a few weeks ago at
Google i/o was Android one and that was
the effort and how to put android in the
hands of the next billion users and
we've received news that the first
Android one device will be launched this
October in India we can assume that this
will be the micromax's smartphone which
Google mentioned would be the very first
Android one device to launch at only one
hundred dollars this could be a major
hit in emerging markets sources claim
that this will be a flip card exclusive
flipkart is a retailer that has become
very popular in india the search giant
is not just giving india emotional
support though they are investing more
than 16 million u.s. dollars all for the
sake of taking Android one off the
ground in a successful marketing launch
so allow me to be master of the obvious
here and state that this could change
everything having a decent Android
device that you can update directly from
google play and not have to rely on
carriers that take 18 months to two
years sometimes never to update to the
latest version of Android this could be
google ish asst now we've been fielding
many rumors regarding the samsung galaxy
s5 prime or f or alpha or whatever you
might want to call it but recently we've
received some indications from the
usually reliable Korea Herald Samsung is
reportedly trying to preempt the release
of the larger iphone models the
September with a premium metal built
device of its own this device could be
called galaxy alpha claim the Korean
sources though you may know it better as
the galaxy s a name that appeared in
several leaks and reports thus far the
Galaxy alpha will reportedly feature at
4.7 inch Super AMOLED display a premium
metal body and Exynos 5 octa processor
this device is said to just be 6
millimeters thick which would be
substantially thinner than the galaxy s5
8.1 millimeters
the iphone 5 s's 7.6 millimeters now
eTnews is claimed that this phone could
be launched as early as the end of next
month so back in May samsung announced
that the launch of the s5 was the best
mobile launch ever and they had even ten
percent increase sales over the s4 on
closer inspection however it was a
little bit less than impressive as per
the research done by counterpoint the
eight month old iphone 5s significantly
outpaced the sales of the galaxy s5 in
May 2014 Apple managed to sell seven
million iphone 5s units compared to five
million galaxy s5 units in the same
month by comparison stated counterpoints
researchers the galaxy s4 tied the
iphone 5 last year with 7 million units
sold now for many people one of the
major advantages to having a samsung
android phone over an iphone is the
beautiful large screen but you should
know that later this year in September
Apple's expected to launch two new
iPhones with a 4.7 and a 5.5 inch screen
thereby negating why many people leave
iphone for samsung phones so we'll see
how that works for samsung and
unfortunately i have some bad news for
all you know kia x fans it turns out
microsoft just recently announced that
future nokia X devices will be launching
with windows phone instead of Android
sorry the shift of Windows Phone is
already underway but Microsoft will
continue to sell and support existing
Android nokia X devices this includes
the nokia x2 announced on june
twenty-fourth and scheduled to become
available globally by the end of the
month microsoft announced and that quote
we plan to drive windows phone volume by
targeting the more affordable smartphone
segments which are the fastest growing
segments in the market with lumia in
addition to the portfolio already
planned we plan to deliver additional
lower-cost Lumia devices by shifting
select future nokia X designs and
products to Windows Phone devices thanks
