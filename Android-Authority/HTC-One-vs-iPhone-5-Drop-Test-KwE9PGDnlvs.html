what's going on everybody and today
we're coming to you from D Hollywood
sign stop here on Mulholland Drive to
bring you a blockbuster video so I'm
gonna go ahead and answer your question
right now I am happy to see you but that
is also an HTC One in my hand now we
just did a review on this and it turned
out to be one of the best handling
phones and with a very good build
quality there's something about this
phone that reminds us of something else
and that would be of course the iPhone 5
with iPhone 5 being pretty much the
benchmark of design and build quality
what are we going to do with it and the
HTC one well obviously we're gonna drop
it it's drop test time alright so if
you've seen our drop test from before
we're going to be doing three particular
tests that are going to try and mimic
real-world situations and those three
are going to be from the pocket right
over here also from about the chest
level and then of course when you're on
the phone for example coming from your
head well we're working with a lot of
stone and concrete right here at the
Hollywood sign observatory but also the
drops themselves should be able to
provide a pretty good impact coming from
this particular type of floor so iPhone
5 drop test coming straight from my
pocket counting down in my head one two
three and
all right so it landed right on its face
oh man and what a start
what a fantastic start to this drop test
I dropped it it went right on to its
right onto its face and there goes the
screen and and let's see if it's even
operational you see there that turns on
but let's see if we can so just like
with typical iPhones running the screen
gets cracked you are still able to use
the screen somewhat alright so we're
gonna move on to the HTC One from there
all right pocket tests right now H you
see one here we go go from the side and
so as you can see landed right on the
corner right here and pretty much the
only damage that happened to the HTC one
was that this particular cover snapped
right off we're gonna find out if I can
get snapped right back in right now it
doesn't quite seem like it but we're
gonna take a look at it a little more
later
no damage over on the sides looks like
it's just in the corner with a pretty
good dent alright so as you saw in the
previous test the iPhone really didn't
fare very well but that's the reason why
we do the test from the pocket because
as you're taking the phone away from
your pocket it could fall any which way
but fortunately the iPhone 5s came up a
little bit short had some bad luck and
just fell right on its face but now
we're gonna move on to the next test and
that would be dropping it from around
the chest area
so this is also a pretty common scenario
someone bumps into you while you're
holding your phone just drops right onto
the floor from the chest you can see
what my hand is right there and
all right so this time you didn't fall
on its face thankfully but instead it
fell right on its bottom right on the
corner right over here
all right and as you can see right there
you're gonna get a little bit of
scuffing right on the corner so the
aluminum body the aluminum chassis does
seem to be holding a pretty well here
and we'll see if the HTC One has the
same luck when it comes to its aluminum
body and it's aluminum chassis all right
now unfortunately when it came to the
HTC one that little speaker grill cover
just happened to well pop off and the
adhesive does it look like it's able to
keep the cover on even after I tried HTC
one test from the chest right over here
that same corner got hit again and
because that aluminum on the front is
not there anymore it doesn't make it so
that the phone has a little bit less
protection so what ended up happening is
you got a little bit of a bigger dent
there it's like it pushed it right in so
we're back to the iPhone again for our
third and probably final test we'll see
what happens with the HTC One after this
but we're gonna be dropping it from
about this height now I'm about five
seven five eight so this is gonna be
maybe like five six drop test iPhone
five right from the face right here we
go I'm gonna lean over a little bit that
way it'll get right there in front of
camera and down we go
for the iPhone just it's landing on its
face every single time well not every
time but we turn on the phone and it
does look like it still works but it
would be dangerous to use because if
you're going around you might get cut by
the glass dust that is forming around on
all of those shatters let's take a look
around the phone doesn't look like there
are really any real damages across the
phone aside from the screen so we're
gonna move on to the HTC One alright so
let's just go ahead and get right on to
it so coding from head height leaning
forward a little bit let's see what
happens when it drops here we go
again it didn't fall on its face so
perhaps that has something to do with
the balancing on the phone itself so
what we're looking at here is really no
damages on the screen at all we're
looking around and it looks like the
other side of the phone this time on the
bottom corner is what got damaged here
so you're gonna see that dent right
there and it's going to come in and Bend
the aluminum just a little bit so for
the most part though the phone is still
working just fine as you can see there
this big blemish down here on the bottom
of course is something to leave desired
but it looks like the phone itself is
working just fine as far as the screen
goes so we'll see what we can do about
that screen in our upcoming final big
test the iPhone unfortunately had a lot
of bad luck because it fell on its face
the first test and the screen has been
broken ever since even got a little bit
worse the HTC One for whatever reason
hasn't had that bad luck so this is what
we're going to do one last final test
from above my head gonna give it one
less try to drop it right on his face
there it is
perfect impact right on his face and we
look over there's the standard screen so
just what we were looking for with the
HTC One because it didn't fall on its
face the way the iPhone 5 did but this
time it did and as you can see the
screen is shattered so the screen has
the exact same problems as the iPhone 5
and we're going to go and turn it on and
see if it we're still works fine it
looks like it does so we have thoroughly
destroyed these two phones pretty much
as expected here in the heart of Los
Angeles and yeah so we're gonna recap in
just a little bit and give the iPhone 5
and the HTC One their final farewells
man I got to tell you it hurt me it hurt
me hurt me to drop these phones but as
you can see it's the screams that have
the most damage because these aluminum
bodies actually have a pretty good
sturdiness to them and so that's
probably a good choice on HTC in order
to make their phone somewhat similar to
the iPhone five and that it has these
glass screen on the front with the
aluminum chassis all around so that
being said the bodies held up very well
when it came to the drop test but when
they fell right on their faces up there
at the Hollywood sign Observatory it
really did cause a lot of damage we are
