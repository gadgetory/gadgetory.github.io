authority we are here checking out the
brand new google maps interface right
now we are on San Francisco because we
are at i/o and if you look at the maps
let's say we're looking for some tacos
today type in tacos it's going to give
you a whole lot of options now if we
zoom in just a little bit
type on let's sit on nopalito click on
that you see a lot of this stuff around
it changes what it's doing is it's
highlighting some of the lesser needed
streets on the Grandview for navigation
purposes so let's say I'm over in off of
16 and guerrero over here and I want to
walk to nopalito it'll give me more
names of smaller streets so I know
exactly where I'm going and if I click
up here on directions
it's going to ask me where I'm at so
we'll type in the Moscone Center
it's giving me directions now another
thing to highlight is over on this end
this the new search bar is a floating
bar there's no more of the big kind of
clumsy bar at the top and things down
the side this is all going to be dropped
down now so over here i'll give you a
public transit walking biking I don't
really need to fly there so that's good
so let's say I want to take a public
transit over there what it's doing is
it's giving me a few different options
and I can click on more options in time
this is another great thing about the
new google maps it's giving you if you
leave at different times it's going to
give you different routes to take
different public transit to catch and
obviously a different arrival time so if
you want to catch dinner precisely at
450 4pm you know to leave at four 22 and
walk over to that one we're here at the
drop-down we hit Moscone Center which is
where we're at 4i oh it's going to zoom
in a little bit and give us a closer
view of the surroundings and this is one
of the other really great parts about
the new maps if we click street view
here it's going to zoom us in like it's
a warp speed we are good to go we can
look around just like we normally would
these are pictures
the street view obviously we're on a
Chromebook pixel what we can do is we
can just go ahead and zoom all over the
place go ahead and click out of that
there's another great thing about maps
find all the way out as much as we can
you see on the bottom left here earth
click on earth
it's going to give us an earth view with
this one you can keep zooming out cheap
zooming out so you get here now these
clouds here and earth you those are real
time so this is exactly where the clouds
are and exactly where they're headed
this is daylight and this is the night
so guys this is the brand new google
maps should be hitting us fairly soon
sometime this summer we are playing with
it here at i/o stay tuned to our YouTube
channel we got a lot more coming from
you from IO</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
