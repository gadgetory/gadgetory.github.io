Authority and this year's crop of
Motorola products is the first year
fully under the helm of Lenovo but has
this change had any effect on Motorola's
flagship smartphone of the last couple
of years or does the motorola experience
that we've all come to know and love
still remain intact well that's what
we're about to find out with the Moto X
pure edition when looking at the Moto X
pure edition from the outside you'll
notice a very familiar design that
essentially involves from last year's
model there's some minor aesthetic
changes but the overall look stays true
to what Motorola started under the
ownership of Google with the most
notable difference this year being the
size it's a much larger phone now and
what once started out as a small compact
smartphone in 2013 is pretty much all
but gone for a phone with a 5.7 inch
screen it doesn't feel as large as you
might initially think and it's
surprisingly manageable in one hand
thanks to the much tighter bezels all
around it's not the thinnest phone in
the world but the sloping curved back
makes it feel thinner than it actually
is
and it's very comparable in size to
phones like the note 5 and the oneplus 2
so if you can handle those phones you'll
be able to handle the Moto X with no
problems at all it's still made of very
high-quality materials with an all metal
frame that gives it a very solid feel
and the default backs are made of a soft
textured silicon material which I
personally love because not only does it
feel extremely comfortable but it also
provides a lot of grip if the default
colored backs aren't your thing you can
of course customize it through moto
maker which to me has always been one of
the best parts about owning a Moto X
there's a ton more options to choose
from now than ever before with a myriad
of colored backs wood backs leather
backs accent colors and you can still
put your own custom engraving to truly
make it your own
a Moto X also wouldn't be a moto X
without the signature Motorola tempo on
the backside which is now encased in a
single metallic strip with the camera
module and LED flash and the dimples
back to a much smaller and more subtle
size which I personally like a lot
better over the large dimple on last
year's Moto X taking a tour around the
rest of the device the buttons and ports
are in pretty typical locations for a
Motorola device you've got the power and
volume buttons on the right side where
they're very easy to reach and the power
button still has that same Ridge texture
that makes it easy to find by feel on
the bottom is the standard microUSB port
and up top is the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack sitting dead center along
with the nano SIM card tray that now
doubles as a micro SD card slot for
extra storage on the front side there's
quite a bit of action going on besides
the typical ambient light and proximity
sensors you have the IR sensors for
triggering motor display without
touching the phone front-facing speakers
and the front-facing camera with a
selfie flash both of which we'll get
into a little bit later the display on
this year's Moto X not only received a
big bump in display size but also in
resolution it is now a 5.7 inch screen
with a resolution of 2560 by 1440 but
unlike the last two Moto X's it's not
AMOLED anymore and has instead been
swapped out for a TFT LCD display I'll
admit I am a little bit saddened by the
swap and display technology is simply
because features like moto display don't
look quite as cool anymore because you
can see the entire backlight light up
but otherwise it's a great-looking panel
it's bright beautiful has great viewing
angles and it's pretty easy to see in
direct sunlight and the colors are
surprisingly very vibrant and saturated
what they quad-hd resolution it's also
extremely sharp and the large screen
size makes it pretty awesome for
browsing the web playing games and
watching videos or movies so overall I
really have no complaints about the
display with the previous two moto X's
motor will put a bigger emphasis on the
user experience and didn't worry so much
about having the latest and greatest
specs and the story is pretty much the
same here with the pure edition moto X
instead of the Snapdragon 810 Motorola
took the LG route and opted for the 808
which is perfectly fine by me
considering that the eight away is a
more than capable processor there's
three gigs of RAM on board for all of
your multitasking needs and in everyday
use performance has generally been
pretty good as you would expect from a
device with high-end specs and running
what is essentially a mere stock build
of Android the only hiccup that I've
ever noticed is that it sometimes likes
to hang on the lock screen when
unlocking directly from motor display it
doesn't happen all the time but often
enough that you will notice it but other
than that it opens apps multitask and
plays games just as well as the best of
them and hopefully this minor issue can
be resolved fairly quickly through a
software update you've got all the usual
connective
options that you might expect like Wi-Fi
Bluetooth GPS NFC and of course LTE and
one of the most convenient things about
the Moto X is that supports practically
every single LTE band for all the major
carriers here in the States
so t-mobile AT&amp;amp;T Verizon Sprint it
doesn't matter which carrier on this
phone is essentially just plug and play
so you basically take this phone to any
carrier plug your SIM card and you are
good to go for storage the Moto X comes
in either 16 32 or 64 gigs of internal
storage and like I mentioned earlier the
SIM card slot doubles as a micro SD card
slot for up to an additional 128
gigabytes if you need the extra space as
far as the speakers go they sound
awesome on the Moto X this year they're
true front-facing stereo speakers this
time around and on top of being
extremely loud they deliver a very clean
and rich sound that really tops off the
media experience I would say they're
still not quite as good as HTC's
boomsound but definitely a close second
and they're obviously better than any
other phone out there with a single
firing speaker battery life on the Moto
X hasn't been all that great in my
experience even though it's packing a
fairly hefty 3000 milliamp hour battery
inside and I can get through a full day
but it's literally by the skin of my
teeth and the phone typically only lasts
me about 12 to 13 hours before I finally
have to put it back on a charger and if
you'd like to game a lot on your phone
you can pretty much forget about this
phone getting anywhere near a full day
so if I had to rank the battery life of
the Moto X against other flagship
smartphones I would say it's definitely
better than the s6 for sure
but not as good as something like the
note 5 or even the LG g4 the nice thing
about the Moto X though is that it
charges extremely fast with Motorola's
turbo power charger motorola says is the
fastest charging smartphone in the world
which is a pretty bold claim whether
that's actually true or not is another
story entirely but with the phone turned
completely off I've been able to go from
zero to full in roughly 75 minutes time
making the Moto X pretty easy to fill up
or top off any time during the day one
of the biggest weaknesses of the Moto X
line or any Motorola phone in recent
years really is the camera and Motorola
is looking to change all of that this
year on the rear is a 21 megapixel
sensor with F 2.0 aperture but no OAS
and the front phaser is a 5 megapixel
wide-angle lens with an included
front-facing flash which is a really
nice
but considering the front camera does a
decent job on its own and it's perfectly
capable of finding your face in most
situations the flash isn't particularly
all that useful unless you happen to
take a lot of selfies and pitch-black
rooms and even then the front flash can
be blindingly bright and tends to flood
the image with harsh lighting more than
it does to illuminate it with the
exception of adjusting the focus point
and exposure Motorola's camera interface
still lacks a full suite of manual
controls that other smartphone camera
interfaces offer but it is very easy to
use you can tap anywhere on the
viewfinder to take a photo swipe left to
review any photos that you've taken or
swipe to the right to make adjustments
to the camera settings it's pretty
bare-bones we can do things like toggle
through different modes like HDR night
mode panorama 4k video recording and
other things of that nature picture
quality on the Moto X has been
surprisingly great and--can deputy tel
motorola put a very big focus on making
the camera experience better on this
year's Moto X in medium to good lighting
photos are very sharp and detailed and
color reproduction is on point with just
the right amount of vibrancy and
saturation the HDR image processing on
the Moto X has also been quite nice it
does a great job of bringing out a lot
of detail from the shadows especially in
high contrast or backlit scenarios and
adds just a little bit of extra
saturation and warmth to the images
without causing them to look unnatural
low-light performance has also made some
really huge strides this year I would
say it's still not as good as something
like the s6 or no.5 but definitely leaps
and bounds better than the 2014 Moto X
for several reasons the images are much
sharper and more detailed which you can
see pretty easily when zooming into text
the colors and white balance is more
accurate it handles exposure a lot
better especially in the highlights and
most importantly there's a lot less
digital noise so thumbs up to Motorola
for the improved picture quality and for
finally producing a camera that is
capable of taking photos that people
won't feel embarrassed about to share to
social media one of the main reasons why
I and maybe a lot of other users as well
have gravitated the Moto X for the past
couple of years is because of the
software experience and how quick
Motorola is with updates just like
previous Moto X's and other motor
devices within the last couple of years
the Moto X pure addition is running a
mere stock build of android 5.1.1
lollipop and because this phone is being
sold completely free
carriers there's no carrier bloatware to
get in the way it's as pure as you can
get without buying a nexus with the only
exception being Motorola's baked in
custom features which I actually find to
all be really useful motor display is
still as good as ever subtly pulsating
anytime you receive a notification and
Motorola has added the ability to
control your music from it now what you
couldn't do before so that was a very
welcome change then you have moto voice
for dictating voice commands and you can
still customize it with your own key
phrase if you'd like but what I love
most about moto voice besides the
always-on listening is using it for
navigation being able to tell your phone
to navigate home or anywhere that you
need to go without having to wake up the
phone or touch it at all it's extremely
useful especially if you have your phone
sitting in a car dock like I do it's
also a lot safer when you're driving
speaking of safety you also have moto
assist which can read your text messages
out loud and tell you who's calling or
just keep your phone completely quiet to
avoid interruptions and this can also be
done any time you're in a business
meeting or simply just need to get some
shut-eye and finally you have moto
actions which are all really nifty and
intuitive features you can wave your
hand over the front o phone to trigger
motor display chopped twice to trigger
the LED flash and if you take a lot of
pictures you'll find yourself using the
double twist of the wrist to launch the
camera pretty much on a daily basis
motorola is taking a different approach
with these sales of the Moto X this year
instead of partnering with carriers
Motorola is sending the phone direct to
consumers through Motorola comm Amazon
and Best Buy for a base price of $400
unlocked which is an absolute bargain
for a smartphone of this calibre and if
you're upgrading from a previous
generation Moto X the pure edition is a
no-brainer for $400 you really can't go
wrong you're getting some very high-end
specs great build quality a large
beautiful high-resolution display a
camera light won't disappoint and one of
the cleanest and pure Android
experiences around most importantly you
have moto maker a customization tool
that allows users to create a truly
unique experience that's yet to be
rivaled by anyone and being able to
create a product that is a
representation of you it's something you
can't put a price on as always thank you
