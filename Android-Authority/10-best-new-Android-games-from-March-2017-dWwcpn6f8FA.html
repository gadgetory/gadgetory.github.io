handy the Android authority a sky and
it's about that time of the month to
round out the best new Android games
that were released in the month of March
if you want to check out any of these
games for yourself you can find those
links in the video description below the
classic board game Clue has made its
official appearance on mobile also the
game is a faithful recreation of the
original you'll be going through the
game trying to figure out who did what
where and with what instrument it comes
with a clue sheet that should more or
less fill itself out based on your
suggestions like the original is a fun
little mystery game and it's $3.99 with
no in-app purchases or advertising to
get in the way it's a must-have for
board game plan ghosts and goblins
Mobile is one of several Capcom remakes
to have hit mobile over the last few
months this one is a remake of the
classic 1980s arcade game you'll play as
a faithful knight who must overcome
obstacles and bad guys to reach the end
it's challenging quick to learn and
surprisingly well done it's difficult
but it's kind of supposed to be and
you'll also be able to choose between
four different button layouts even so
some have complained that the controls
are a little too hard in any case it's a
dollar ninety-nine with no in-app
purchases Island Delta is the latest
game from noodle cake studios this one
is an action-adventure game and you'll
be running through levels blasting bad
guys and overcoming obstacles in order
to reach the end of any given level the
game contains 30 levels stretched across
three chapters you'll also have hidden
areas to find a storyline to play
through and a lot more it's a little
buggy but newer games generally are it's
$2.99 and it has no in-app purchases
link twin is an interesting new puzzle
game where you play as two people who
have to overcome obstacles the two move
in tandem and you must use the obstacles
in the level to change their location
relative to one another there are over
100 levels to complete ten different
types of objects to interact with and a
whole lot more plus it has that minimal
graphical style that is all the rage
right now it's relatively cheap at a
dollar ninety-nine it's fun and it's
worth a shot
mushroom 11 is a post-apocalyptic puzzle
game you'll play as a giant pile of
fungus and when you destroy part of the
blob it regenerates on the opposite side
of the blob that you destroyed you use
this mechanic to move it around the
levels until you reach the end there are
seven different worlds to play through
dozens of achievements and the Macan
sir built-in to let you track things
like speed runs and scoring challenges
it's a solid effort especially
considering that it's a pay once game
with no in-app purchases octane is a
point-and-click horror game you'll play
the role of a dude who gets dragged into
a dark forest somewhere where a bunch of
creepy stuff happens you'll have to find
things solve puzzles and proceed through
the plot in order to make it out alive
it's not the most graphically appealing
game ever but the mechanics are solid
the only issue is that you can only save
the game after you complete a chapter
that means you're locked in for a while
if you decide to play otherwise it's a
dollar ninety-nine with no in-app
purchases shadow mattock is a unique
puzzle game with some fun mechanics the
game works by dangling random objects in
front of a light your job is to move
twist and turn the objects until the
shadow it projects is a coherent image
it contains over 100 levels and many of
them have secondary objectives as well
the free demo will give you the first 14
levels for free and you'll have to
unlock the rest with a single $2 and
$0.99 in-app purchase it's a fun and
family-friendly puzzle game splitter
critters is a platformer puzzle game the
mechanics in this one are fairly unique
you literally have to slice levels in
order to proceed obstacles to get in the
way have to be moved by cutting the
level apart and removing them yourself
that's kind of fun otherwise the game
has some colorful graphics and some cute
characters those willing to give it a
shot while to shell out $2.99 at least
there are no in-app purchases the same
that Super Mario run is now out on
Android and it only took three months of
waiting to get here for those who
somehow don't know you'll play as Mario
as you run through a bunch of levels you
need to avoid obstacles collect coins
and a whole lot more it also features an
online multiplayer mode as well as a bit
of a builder mode as you rebuild the
Mushroom Kingdom
the mechanics have been a bit polarizing
but objectively speaking the game works
pretty well it's free to demo if you
want to try it out or you can fork out
$9.99 for the full version the frost
rune is a point-and-click adventure game
with a deeper story lines and most
you'll find your character shipwrecked
during a summertime storm and the idea
is to find and overcome obstacles in
order to find out what's going on
wherever it is that you landed it's
filled with stuff like Norse mythology
Viking myths and some other similar
concepts it's a decent game that
shouldn't take long to play you can
download the demo for free or pick up
the full version for
and that about does it for this one
