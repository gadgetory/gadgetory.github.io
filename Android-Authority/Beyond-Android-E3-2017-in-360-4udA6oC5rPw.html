right so we have been here for your
source looking at virtual reality and
gaming in general but you wanted to come
on to answer the authorities YouTube
channel just to talk a little bit about
e3 in general we also want to tell you
guys about content on PR source at all
John is here for VRS runs you got a
bunch of I got a couple of videos out
you were never a like my picked em yeah
we play a lot of gr content on and also
there's going to be a 360 videos you can
kind of see some of the sights of the
sounds of III I mean just alive everyone
for the routing around I mean this is
kind of a prime spot yes early I don't
know if you'll be able to see her behind
the sign that tells you wine mixtures
III is gonna be but you know I think
first for now you can talk about just
sort of our time on the show we have
plenty oh that's the biggest thing is
yeah which has been fine yes blind to
the crowds you can see right behind you
here
huge mind lashes really different really
Mike Pharisee which is moving along but
this year it was all about come on
even just this all because we're in the
out lobby right now we're and I don't
want to use the word more priority but
like the smaller stuff the less
hard-hitting stuff here in the South
Lobby you know it's available it can
direct sunlight
you have natural lighting nice place to
be when you're not when you're getting
kind of overwhelmed the III craziness
inside but even then the life of Crash
Bandicoot after you gain my analysis
line point all the way around with my
dear and I bet you these are all the
people who came up on trying to play the
stuff inside hell anything to finance
just disappoint you it's usually like a
twenty minute twenty thirty million yeah
we're going to crazy a kind like in city
about they for hours yeah there was one
it was people wanted to play destiny
Jews in particular like crazy and then
there was a line around the earth which
would Nintendo booth in particular all
yeah it's a just flapping around
sneaking in
unbelievable but how did why you'll piss
off like what the thing is we wanted to
be able to go around playing certain
things I wanted to play harvesters
Capcom anything that you're really kind
of prophets of the Skyrim oh yes we are
oh yeah decrypted via our status I
wanted to play some of the new
properties or rather than actual
expandable games and obvious and like
it's a collaborative and I think it was
PlayStation that sold for investment was
Bethesda that cares like that in order
to play it all out you have to be your
first good morning with any and even
then the likely of you yeah even earlier
than that because people are already
lining up in two hours reports ago
that's man if I have my skeleton so we
don't want to really get too far into
all the PR stuff because you could go to
three or four calm you didn't you live
right outside
and we talked about the PR scrum that we
worship it's just kind of a bummer that
today when we had time to do so we was
no adult man if you're a Superman III is
still a great place to be and you'll be
able to get that glimpse into a game you
might end up lying anyway so I mean
that's my grandpa but otherwise you know
you come for three days total and on
each day you take one thing you want to
do physical pain but in any case we
build a couple of Android things so we
can talk about right now and we'll start
off with us
Anthony Casso headset well there there
me order later one it's going to be the
pink over me that's the one wimpy motion
track you can walk around a 3585 it's
standalone VR hand side you you put I
play with it a little bit won't you give
a surprise
oh well the unplug real Kamala watch but
had a Snapdragon 820 one animal concept
dedicated : wand we are head tag as
slaves or officers because it's all
proprietary store and it has is that
most as taller kind of look like the
agent agent VR headset now so and I like
very much like anime but sing it - $250
for a dedicated mobile for your headset
now that's to me depends on the wall
given like you have you have smart
already take a button
something could be yes yes I agree with
you there but you know anybody who wants
to get into daydreams it doesn't have a
phone already
there's a lot of money to stomach you
know something like seven dollars for a
pixel and then the danger headset itself
that doesn't do anything without a
vehicle is already maybe another $100 of
you but then for me Republicans be
really that scared for you buy into this
you're given alleged debt you know
something galaxy support and then we'll
have a desk gathering support Peoria it
has we are hundred incredibly mountain
the marketing content mobile Viagem yeah
mobile VR right now has a Content
problem because if you're going to get a
headset like this and you end up really
finding a lot of my good content out
there and $250 no skill I come over to
us
there but luckily Google with a Google
IO they did announcement and alarmed us
that's going to be in zinc maybe the
price point will be something like 149
199 for though but by then there's been
there better be a lot of the content in
the daydream stack so but as far as the
actual device itself
I just knew about because this is typing
to our first look at what would be the
daydream and Alan it's good because
you're able to actually sense it since
flagging in the direction even the most
controller you help it just to recognize
those motion it's 20 houses how much it
looks like a daydream given the
controller it does
very much like it like that wasn't
really to legislate well okay how about
it have you ever been wild like a dream
okay so there's three different people
we are handle Beyonce like right now to
me well currently it's missing that
third layer which basically in the
spacious movement look boy still looking
around couple once dedicated magic
practices and maybe yes absolutely going
to be more Marissa but until then it's
it's really tough that's why I call it a
game for not not paying $50 for your
experience pain more like $10 so right
now there are some award-winning games
in a daydream we are area like virtual
virtual reality which I'm so surprised
you haven't tried to it's a hilarious
game I haven't played through it too
much farm relic important speaking of
king of gaming like that we did get a
couple of books at a couple of hours
looking for Android compatible community
because I'm flying to New York
okay after recording right now and for
that long flight because I have a
layover Chicago I wanted to view I play
something you know and I wanted a
controller for that I might need to go
to Fry's Electronics for the later maybe
we'll do that after this and I'll take a
look at a couple of controllers I can
use for my flight to New York
but we have we ran into the night
who were developing a integrated
controller for the gear VR I thought it
was pretty interesting lab you have all
the controls and the Batwa triggers are
off the back I'm part of it but then it
snaps into the area so you take that out
put your phone in and you got your
controller for whatever we are is going
to be doing I thought that was pretty
cool don't see how I know it's played on
you can use your chest at the boot I
don't have any Wi-Fi you should be
powerful yeah that was one thing that I
was a little bit too positive and we
didn't really see I'm sure that there
are android games here but they not as
prevalent even given mobile VR like we
were asking for every every VR demo and
meaning that we had is there a mobile
version and all like our focusing on
five
so a little bit from an android
standpoint III is Logan disappointing
lahmacun a live appearance in a big B
but definitely go around pretty much
yeah all right so we're coming up on the
10 minute mark for this so what I want
to do is just as you know first of all
thank you so much for watching all of
our stuff and watching this video as
well
remember I don't know where to be all
resource from all of the different
pieces of content we did for all the
different VR demo that we have so you
guys will enjoy that and of course it
basically round affected what was your
favorite thing my favorite they
experience all around yeah all around me
Delta the Aqua gripped us control at one
gameplay and Karina I only know
multiplayer be or aspect only one Asha
fact and it just really quad kind of
nature everyone and it felt like you
were 0 Jesus me now it's very convinced
I kind of agree with you there like I
was actually blown away by how good
oculus rift was not that I thought it
was any worse or better that they should
be live but I will always have the HDD
nation see Bob will always have some
ways to my heart because that was the
first like walk around er see you loo my
mind and I want to say with FIFA two
years ago we have using appreciate that
only p.m. you see two years ago they
have you know you're right no ism have
you seen two years ago that was the one
where like I previously like rush about
just how amazing the experience but then
once we put on those oculus rift without
controllers man they work so much just
like grabbing and holding on yeah
probably my favorite thing that I did it
to show though this machine regards to
our work
I don't know I'm a big fan of the beat
em up game I actually thought bloody
well yeah I was really a unique aspect
to be are great a traditional
side-scrolling fighter
keep in mind the stuff we're talking
about because there are videos and
article and resource for that so make
sure you need to to be our source for
all kinds of reality and then of course
you can stay tuned general authority for
more from myself I'm a time you have
John to last long channels well and you
can stick around for more Android love
maybe it Sandra Amy new here we are you
know there are ways a sort of bridge in
the gap between that's your problem so
keep it tuned here and remember that we
are your source for all things Android
and more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
