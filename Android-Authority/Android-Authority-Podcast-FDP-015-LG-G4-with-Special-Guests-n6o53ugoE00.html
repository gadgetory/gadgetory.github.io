to show off their new devices but this
one was no different as the LG g4 launch
event was held at the top of one World
Trade Center and you can see New York
behind me in all of his glory hey it's
Josh with our firm and round Authority
what's goin on everybody and here is
your LG g4 launch event rundown
swaying swaying Dom hard at work
this is where we're podcasting for God's
sake
it's a repurposed ship made into a
restaurant and an actual boat is where
we decided to do our podcast and it's
swaying like crazy i hope we don't throw
up historic register of historic places
we're recording on a zoom h2n in the
middle of the Hudson River it's probably
not right on the banks of the Hudson
River there are helicopters going by
listeners we're sorry if we're sorry
this is not on video we're sorry that
you may have the occasional here hello
everybody and welcome to the fdp by
android authority where P stands for
podcast i am your host of course Joshua
Vergara what's going on everybody and
yes we are changing things up a little
bit we had been contemplating changing
the name of the podcast for a little
while for very specific reasons nothing
too crazy however but nonetheless we did
find that the hashtag fdp was pretty
popular among you guys on social media
especially on twitter and we liked it as
well so we decided to call this podcast
the android authority fdp where P stands
for podcasts and the rest is up to your
imagination this week we have a super
special show I'm really excited to bring
this to you guys on as usual when we go
to particular trade shows or in this
case the LG g4 press conference and
launch we get to see our friends in the
industry and I was able to get a few of
them to sit down with us and to talk to
us about to the LG g4 and among other
things we do talk about project 5 for a
little bit even at the beginning of this
show but what was even better was that
we got to record this on a very unique
location I have Florence ion from Green
Bay and PC world who suggested that we
should go to this restaurant nearby that
was on a barge and had a ship connected
to it where you can sit and eat and
drink now the ship is actually on the
Hudson River it's just flat floating and
swaying to and fro so you'll hear a lot
of noise in the background helicopters
going over and you can hear actually the
boat creaking while it's moving around
and was just really fun and then I also
had michael fisher from pocketnow and
dom Esposito of 925 Google and also from
his own YouTube page the youtube.com
slash
dom channel and we were all just able to
sit down out in the open in the brisk
New York City night air and be able to
talk for quite a while about the LG g4
and plenty of times did we get off the
rail so I hope you guys enjoy this
tangent adverse of the fdp if you're
watching the YouTube version of this
podcast then you will have already seen
at the very beginning of this video that
I put in a couple of clips just to show
you the setting that we were in at that
it would be really nice to show that to
you guys so if you're on the audio
version of the podcast thank you so much
for listening on all the different
podcasts networks but if you want to see
just a little bit just a little bit of a
behind-the-scenes look as to where we
actually recorded this time around you
can head over to the Youtube version at
our YouTube channel don't forget to keep
hashtagging that fdp all over social
media and head on over to google plus
when you have a chance and you'll find
our polls weekly so that we can find out
what topic you guys want us to talk
about on the fdp without and you further
ado here is episode number 15 of the fdp
LG g4 launch g4 preview a little bit of
project by and a whole lot else help you
guys enjoy
I'm still grab you are my friend great
way to start I basically can't go on
Instagram one-on-one data because they
eat so much data and I'm like why do you
want them to do oh you're on a carrier
than minutes you're gonna wanna fun like
your elements my data i just bought a
lot of it i'm on a family plan sure your
do I can I sure my data with six people
gotta be kidding me what is what it's so
cheap for you is it your Romanian
extended i have several cousins
so I really cool and welcome to the
podcast yeah no it's nice as we don't
have to worry about an earthquake
happening like we would in California
yeah firstly and then as she says that
is tsunami you're stuck to my god funny
oh we're on the camp would be fun yeah
we'd be mono we go driving up 40 50
sweet well this is this is a product of
low suggestion and your excitement oh
yeah here on a boat are you recording
right now ok we're on i see i did one of
my goals for the podcast when I ready to
alive is always have somebody asked me
as a musically might know Israel okay
and then what the intro music starts oh
no I do a candidate Rojas of off
production like
later tonight over
and say everything that's needed but
this is a special one I love doing the
live ones because you get like guests
but also you know because you see each
other one yeah you know not behind no
you can't another what we means you can
I around with my upload and teasing one
another with french fries which is
apparently i'm eating french fries and
it's well documented to my to my android
authority fans that i am a diet men
diabetic so i am being very good right
now as I and I am a woman just so every
that's also very well documented DOM is
editing right now he is he is dipping
right now it's awesome I am editing a
video we were talking about carriers
just at the beginning of the podcast I
did want to work a min a pretty loose on
this one we are going to talk about the
LG g4 obviously because we've all put
out our videos and content on it I'm
curious we're talking about the carriers
how did you guys feel about project 50 I
got an extended podcast laughs when you
can t well damn Ilan sorry for one
they're using sprint and tmobile correct
yes their network so yes those so
technically for me it doesn't okay
sprint if in my area is where they
happen to be using sprint's then
nevermind basically I'm interested in it
but also it's not for people that are
data home
I feel like based on their pricing okay
just 10 gigabyte the ten dollars a
gigabyte is not like the best in the
world especially if you're going through
a lot of gigabytes but if they're also
minutes they're pushing the idea that
you should be going through a Wi-Fi
hotspots all the time too that's a lil
punkin yeah but I mean where those
aren't everywhere in every city that
they're offering or is that this is
going to be available either like I know
like where I'm at there's not a lot of a
whole lot of hot spots everywhere yeah
so I don't know you know I think I think
it's cool that maybe yeah google if
anything they're just trying to break
the mold yeah and that's cool I think I
can hit back is that it only pushes
other carriers further blank well we had
a very spirited conversation about last
week on the ftp i make the case that i
honestly think that we're very spoiled
by the term on the way there where he at
least well buy it because the joe hindy
god bless them uses like something like
50 gigs a month or something there's no
that would turn out to be a good through
20 so what does your so what's your
argument is this is not necessary I as
much as I love having a limited data on
my t-mobile plan if I was on Google fly
I would be more aware of what I music
right and thus you know I think the
point is moot because if you know you're
gonna pay ten dollars per gigabyte
you're actually going to be a little bit
more Spartan about your usage and what
even is that a good thing I think it's a
good thing because if the argument for
the carriers is that the ultimate high
usage of data whether it's the speed of
the bandwidth or how much bandwidth is
being used is the problem with data
packages then here is a model that makes
everybody look
yeah aren't they already aware like I
mean we've been through two years three
years now in the states of most of the
carrier is not offering unlimited data I
think we're pretty well whipped now yeah
that's a thing is because everyone was
really everyone on the podcast for the
most part well mostly Joe was really up
in arms about the fact that there's no
unlimited tea or anything like that and
I said the thing is there's no such
thing as i'm linden everything gets
throttled at some point to make a room
for everyone else is on the same network
right the question of course is like
what what prompts the throttling and for
me the tmobile terms and conditions or
what sort of turned me around on that
because i went into the t-mobile store
being like you're going to give me
unlimited in i think you're full of
because i think you've got the throttle
me after five gigs arbitrarily and
whatever then i looked at the terms that
it turns out that i haven't been
corrected on this yet i'll be happy to
buy one of your listeners if this
applies they'll only throttle you if
you're doing something like torrenting
or
doing something that is the unis case
you're right and essentially a tiny you
know list of circumstances none of which
apply to me ever so I do have unlimited
data and every time I pick up my phone
that matted bit of like I still do it I
feel like a like a victim of like
carrier data abuse because i'll pick up
my phone seriously still every time and
be like oh I'm gonna go to a Spotify or
I'm gonna blow to website oh god what's
my David doing right now I over my limit
oh I don't have to worry about that and
that constant feeling of like oh god oh
I feel better because I could do
whatever I want yeah I think that's
seriously undervalued by the bigger
carriers that don't offer on the mat
data I just think that I don't know I I
saw a lot of people being really pissed
off at that at that payment model and I
just thought to myself there's there's
there's no reason to completely
discredit it if you really think about
where we are in mobile carriers today in
fact that unlimited is so true this is a
term that i really think we've been
spoiled that's all and Joe called me and
said you just hate unlimited data like
no I love it I need you know but you
know if yes it's true if you're super
data-hungry maybe the project five
models I've read about at the same time
they're showing off a particular system
that addresses a lot of problems that
data
so I tend to look at a classical I like
the idea of project 5 because it'll make
my you know crazy glamorous world
traveling life a lot easier awesome um
I'll be able to buy data in the States
through google and just go to Europe and
be able to have data because right now
I'm on Verizon and I don't have the
luxury of going overseas on t-mobile and
being able to you know just carry that
over with me I have to always buy a sim
card and that's such an annoyance and
just in just have the ability to have
maps like google maps on me when I'm in
a foreign country in a new city like I
just I love having a little bit of
security to that point I used my
particular data plan until 2 to the
effect i feel like 85 to 90 dollars for
my plan because i also get tethering
which is another issue that project
fight hasn't really addressed I wasn't
offering yeah doesn't really offer it
and if they do they don't really know
that no one knows how it's going to be
offered well i don't i don't think
project fires for us yeah this one
thanks it's not it's not for us it's for
a very different subset of people and
you know google is really going in the
direction of trying to go you know first
of all they're really going after
emerging markets right with the Android
one and everything and I think project
Phi has some sort of relationship to
that particular game plan yeah they have
going on like they're just trying to tap
into a particular subset of the market
that the big carriers haven't tapped
into I mean maybe this is maybe we
should see this more as the end of the
MVNO even though it is technically
but like the end of the independent you
know like Oh boost mobile who cares why
would you do boost mobile you can go
through google we actually got pitched a
couple stories from MV knows who said
hey Google is doing this fine thing you
want to write about our thing that's the
same exact thing we've been doing for
years it's the same things that I should
not call Google Phi and I actually you
know I pitched it to our news guys and I
was just like you guys make this
decision this is not my decision to make
right now I'm busy doing 105 reviews and
came back to me basically said yeah the
whole right the google fight thing is
significant because it's google yeah and
it's not terribly but even they know i
mean obviously we did people say it all
the time that when you buy into a Google
ecosystem you're buying into being a
beta tester and there's a reason why but
requires got project fine so all right
right you know I thought that was going
for but yeah we're uh yeah I just wanted
to get you guys to stop something
because we had a very long conversation
about last week on the FG video so I
think I sort of Satan wanted it to be
something like that it was like nerdy
sheep like a nexus fountain you know I
mean I think I I really i like that you
can only use over the Nexus 6 I think
that's I think they're very aware that
that will curtail growth or
I think that's exactly what they're
trying to do also i don't think that
XOXO gonna buy nexus 6 it doesn't know
it doesn't but i don't think that's what
they I don't think that's that's the
primary objective I think it's like a
secondary objective they probably said
to motorola's oh yeah but but primarily
they probably want to you know just
curtail growth until they scale it
properly but I really wanted it to be
something cool and different than nerdy
but now I like like three I can think of
three other ambient I was doing the
exact same thing yeah and if you're
happy where you are already it doesn't
feel like those on your recent move just
yeah right but yeah so yeah we're
obviously in NYC looking over the hudson
river from our boat it's a beautiful
view our boat i would say it's a ship oh
 I'm sorry I i I'm not wearing boat
shoes as Michael is I don't have I
obviously don't have the expertise you
should also mention we're overlooking
the World Trade Center which is where
the LG event was held today it was and I
want you to feel ya so 0 which I'm in
just a instagram i'm gonna do that as
we're talking ok um as I usually do when
it comes to these events I only that's
the same thing and Michael is this like
how's New York have been treating you up
to this event so what we do
it's I love coming here yeah yeah there
are people who fall in love with New
York City they want to live here I'm not
one of them I've never really wanted to
live here James is Claude every time
ever since I started this gig and it
entails like these sort of bimonthly
treks to New York sedation or to come
look at awesome technology that's
secondary like coming to New York City
as a visitor and walking the High Line
like we did earlier to NAB's walking the
streets and talking to people and
telling people where to find the
bathroom on this ship that's also a
restaurant it's awesome it's especially
in the dance rington so this has been
really really cool and the fact that
they held in the World Trade Center i
thought was great because that's the
first time i've been inside the tower
exactly i've never been anywhere near
that area I am does somewhat surreal
he's super surreal and I just want to
quickly share I don't mean interrupt but
I want to quickly share a story when I
was catching a cab because i was running
ridiculously late sorry editors to the
event i asked the guy like oh he's like
where you i'm like one of the World
Trade Center and he asks a cabbie and
the cabbie goes oh you're going to
ground zero come in let's go to ground
zero we're going to ground zero you just
kept saying that and I and I just was
like well I'm not going to ground zero
and we're in the World Trade Center he's
okay you're going to ground zero and I'm
like well I I I guess if you want to
look at it that way that's where it was
and that's what happened but I put on a
shout out on twitter twitter and
apparently it's still referred to that
New Yorkers still refer to it as we're
on zero i dunno and that's just that I
think that's a new york culture thing
that I don't you know I'm not a part of
so I don't really write understand the
slang but it makes sense to me yeah um
it was that for a decade so I understand
it's understandable that would stick it
might be that forever well and I mean
not not to make this a slightly grim
podcast here but think about Boston for
instance like you're always gonna think
of bus and strong because of what
happened you know with the bombing so I
would imagine the ground zeroes sort of
New York's way of having it if not maybe
it's just I can respect just exactly
like like paying homage to the fact that
this really awful thing happened but
everybody is still here and Joe you know
everybody I just wanted to I just
thought I just thought those interesting
thing that happened this morning you
know it's so like on the flip side of
that and that's a dwell on this too long
but I had a similar moment but
completely the opposite during the fresh
mountain I was working through all the
friggin videos all the work we had to do
and you know we're doing the job of
reporting on this phone yeah and I
realized for about two seconds that I'm
60 floors above you know I mean I'm in
this space that talking about this oh
yeah historically I remember and I'm and
then like three say I had three exactly
three seconds to countenance that before
I had to get back to work because that's
the nature of our of our thing yeah
we're all racing each other to do
something well I came over to the window
and while you were taking a picture and
I was like it's extraordinary isn't and
it was that you told me it was at that
moment that you finally realized what
you were taking a picture yeah because
we were taking a picture of the window
of the entire Manhattan Island but the
atom from the vantage point of a very
high of the sky floor right 64 yeah yeah
but it's just a shame that's that the
fact
like the the the nature of our
profession often prevents reflection
even even in the everyday phone screens
indeed oh that's a good one haha so
how's the house me over in treating you
Tom actually Michael is flanked right
now by a bunch of West Coasters poppin
Malone New York representative yeah mush
as the DOM is really triple dipping at
this one now he's multitasking like he
just he just came away from his computer
chick talk on his phone for a second is
back on the computer and now we're in
the pot guy get a tablet I've got
together a video dude I mammals not
actually you know taking music for it
now proving my point there is no time to
do anything else but work Yeah right so
she's in the ashram I am me not here I
mean it's the first work I've really
done today aside from the domain widow I
don't know i don't consider filming like
work even though it's technically was
guilty of initiative it's just were on
the work is editing and putting together
a whole package oh yeah exactly the way
i was writing the script that I did the
voiceover and cutting it together right
now yeah the filming is the artsy part
of it that I enjoy a lot oh for sure
yeah Dom did his voice over here on the
boat yeah that's right alright so
obviously the event we're talking about
as LG g4 that we were up
One World Trade Center and that's the
part that's confusing to people because
you have to say One World Trade son
that's tlj that's another building yeah
in internet you know are there at one no
there's a wide one one with no I thought
there I thought there was like another's
there's two buildings I know what yeah
cuz the isus there's no sorry New
Yorkers we are clueless west coasters
except for Michael for me he's just he's
from Boston or know anything it not from
elite from 100 you are a living boss oh
I had no idea I'm sorry that's no
helicopters overhead yes beautiful sound
of helicopters I mean the city that
never sleeps always stuff well that was
reno no it's my room no reno the biggest
little city city like clearly no city
that never sleeps that was the kitchen
will we is it like right over us that is
a hospital helicopter is just to make
this more grim there's probably a person
who need surgery and is going to a
hospital right now they just they just
done for joy
what's going on that helicopter have you
guys ever been in a helicopter ready I'd
minute left for a fact you have been
yeah I wasn't there but he took us up in
the sound to test how well that's nice
my dad took us up in one when I was 12
in Hawaii that's cool that's really good
well we're uh we just did the pocket did
yes and we talked extensively about the
g-force I like i said i wanted to keep I
just it's just nice i hang out with
everybody we always say that when we get
to get way out um so I'm just going to
keep it really really light obviously
there's comfort all over the place and
you can hear all of our opinions
opportune for so I'm just going to go
around the table just give us your
opinions so i'll start with Michael as
you started with me the last podcast
happy happy to give you my opinion on
the complexity surprised well we'll go
into some of the specific stuff
depending on your guys sure yeah
pleasantly surprised i thought would
moving when they were first toast on the
lead shots of like this weird
leather-bound phone with the look of a G
flex 2 and g3 having a baby yeah that's
kind of like and then you know
Snapdragon 808 those kind of an unknown
factor I didn't know anything about the
screen they like the camera can't look
promising but we didn't know and
everything they showed today they
display they showed in a fast but not
too fast and very confident matter and
now this is where the specifics come in
which I won't talk about but I have the
leather one
really like leather phones this has been
established and so I think that is
tainting my perception a little bit at
this at this point six hours after I
first laid hands on it so come back to
me later I do all about that bamboo and
then you somehow when I was about that
ebony oh yeah yeah yeahs noted that
would that do not misconstrue me sir I
just found out the most amazing thing to
cut you off yeah there are plugs on
trains plugs yeah like on the amtrak
train yeah there's plugs on an art to
and SF i use the moment I was like
worrying about like editing it out here
and stuff because the wind you get back
it's kind of far and long sounds like
damn it I'm not gonna be on the charge
and like oh yeah no man you're good yeah
you're funding right anyway back to
gville yeah I hope you added that hahaha
no that's all state that was gonna
complete surprise to me I'm sorry just
had some clam chowder everyone he did
i'm eating friday he had clam chowder
and I would have been surprised if the
swaying of the boat do something I don't
know where you would have been in his
vicinity so exactly wishes though yeah
chowder much I love her so anybody pours
a good time so far what else is somebody
else talk for a second like a for every
planet alright I'm going to talk about
the g4 I am NOT it like Michael I was
pleasantly surprised by the
specifications by the things that were
announced by the performance with the
short time that I've spent with it
however I'm not particularly keen on the
whole leather back and the whole other
aesthetic like that's just not even
though the yellow leather bag completely
matched your top it did oh but I'm just
I'm not so on the idea of leather on a
smartphone
it's just a little two-inch for me I
just I'm just enjoying the glass and
metal backs that are coming out now in
the Android world so I mean we've been
using so much plastic all this time but
then as far as let's see features
without having or movable back whether
it's whether or not yes they went for a
unibody design do you really think that
it would I think that would be a huge
game changer yeah okay because I think
LG needs to tell a story like Samsung
because that's their big competitor and
but they're all obviously trying to tell
a story contrary I know and I totally
get that but if you think about it
Samsung's sort of trying to tell the
same story as iphone right now yeah and
I guess Mikey you know i'm not i'm not
trying to say that to be an annoying
naysayer it's just that if you think
about the common consumer it's not us
it's people like my mom and my dad and
my relatives and they don't care about
the things that we care about they just
see the iphone and they see this really
stylish phone very easy to use interface
and so the android oems like they kind
of have to mirror that but you know
Google's I was really catered to the
nerds and it's great for the nerds but
it's not so great for mom and dad who
want to be part of smartphones oh yeah
there's not having any trouble keeping
up with the iphone globally I mean it's
no absolutely no beating iOS and hands
off well the to norway flow if ya slow
they're backing everyone whoa
on that is the g4 phone that you could
recommend to your mom and dad for ease
of use I would recommend it to my dad I
would not recommend it to my mom this is
not a fun that she would like I think
because of the leatherback but I could
see my dad using this I could see him
matching it with his outfits my dad's a
little eastern euro metrosexual so I
could definitely see him sporting
lovelies all right Oh Michael the gym
hard to say since you were rubbing
yourself it could happen cuz i would
still be talking just talk too much no
no no I think I you know adequately
summed up my position I think I was the
res but also you know like we fully
believe in having her for six or seven
hours yeah it's closed right now sorry i
keep my keep wishing that was open yeah
right we're right next to the injury
wants to visit it and it seems like this
cyclic bit like the place to be yeah i
agree i were all more in we're at the
what's called the frying pan which is
basically a ship just floating on the
outskirts of the hudson river or you can
eat even though even though the the
actual place where you get the food in
the drink is actually on a barge yeah
nobody is rocking just serenely okay
we're happy or do we walk off we're
going to be shaking as we block oh yeah
our heads are going to still be yeah
yeah well apparently there's an entrance
right next to us into isn't usually like
a restaurant game this ship or a
restaurant is that little part or else
fail because it's icy out there oh yeah
keep expecting this to be over
ellicott well that is so everybody on
the podcast knows it's a really beefy
helicopter looks like a lot of lights on
there every time they running light
flashes you can see the rotor spinning
and it's very very
looks like a police copter it might be
we we are not helicoptered experts
victims are not helicopter aficionado
well I do think that as I second that oh
yeah as I said in the weekly I I really
do think that the Jeep horn will it's
the one that's close to surpassing my
expectations because I do think that the
s6 and in my case s6 edge is probably
the best phone that's come out this year
it's the fond of deep bench the edge not
not not because of the edge of just
saying this when I happen it's I mean
the to use it interchangeably with the s
exactly the truth okay the phones to be
I'm not seeing specific at the edge just
what to say cuz I can the flat one I
think is better than any way I love them
both as a thing it's just the wasn't I
Samsung's offerings offer riskier energy
their offerings for sacrifice you're
very good but I do think that it's the
phone that in the last two trips that
I've taken I actually haven't had my
DSLR in a bag
because I could just isn't it great it's
amazing i love that camera and the thing
that i said before was if the camera on
the jeep or is just as good if not
better than the s6 of the edge because
it has that manual mode and we handed
over the top yeah and when you're
talking about the manual mode a lot in
the previous part comes in but I'm
feeling we're gonna talk about nine hell
yeah no you know I I really need to take
it out for a spin I think after so my
boss is gonna be doing the review and I
think after he's done I'm gonna really
take it out and check it out and see how
it compares to you know an SLR but
honestly I was really bummed about the
s6 is pro mode that was that's really
limited it is really limited and not
only in promote is basically a gimmick
well the promote is basically all the
settings you will get on a auto like a
semi auto mode exactly on a reg a DSLR
summer it's all the way down on the
barge and then you'll see and then
you'll see some stairs DOM is going to
the bathroom and I hope you edit the
south no just I'll stay I have when I
started this podcast I looked at it not
as a tech podcast I looked at as my way
of channeling all the wonderful podcast
and I feel sick see where it really
anything goes and you know we've had
plenty of those situations on the ftp
before I used to have a podcast anyway
yeah they are the s6 and s6 edge their
manual mode it's it's like if you are an
average remote on a cat on a DSLR and
you look at the white balance it would
say that yeah it's a farce it's like oh
you guys wanted manual modes will give
you like a couple little sliders here
you go and then you're like what do you
think I am samsung I want some
full-blown manual controls right now
that's all I wanted a life yeah that's
all you have to give me but as you said
they're not a tithing that they're going
for the bigger right otherwise I know I
know and now I feel like I'm
contradicting myself because this is the
problem with being an Android user in
the stand
age is that it's extremely hard to
choose which phone you should stick with
of course opposed and that's the that's
the that's the downside of having such a
big egos but that's also advantageous
because you have a lot of choices yeah
and no that's what LG is trying to tell
the most you know that they have they
have the camera different from the rest
of them out there the manual vote is one
of the best parts of the camera
experience I really do think it
necesito mi s quebec rotor now what the
best part done right now is that we have
tangents not because I general remaining
to us stuff section happen it's because
of our own okay okay let me keep we have
considered morning erection but yeah the
is obviously a load with all of its
robustness I'll say that hasn't been
offered any other phone and I think
that's great isn't even just talking
about what do you talk what the manual
you're talking about the manual controls
that i'm using right now by the way I'm
not just digging off in her podcast yeah
I'm trying to take a long exposure to
picture of your beer to see if i can
evaluate this thing um you're saying you
haven't seen this on any other phone not
to this level of detail not to this
level of kelvin readings Mike it's got a
histogram sub-100 stops on iso amalfi
it's got a histogram that's what makes
it legit yeah and also the the
simultaneous raw and jpeg files all
right but that we've seen that before
the Lumia 1020 had that let me attend
funny at all these android by my friend
this is always not that was not
specified as android authority Mike oh
good good day to you now I was about on
an android not an Android yeah I suppose
I have to specify that but at the same
time you know obviously I haven't seen
anything like that on there and I was
really excited to see that and it makes
me believe in let's say the color
spectrum sensor that they're using
because you can actually pick a Kelvin
reading on the actual white balance in
the manual can I can I just like be
really ignorant for a second can you
tell me what a couple reading it okay so
from a particular spectrum for those who
don't know yeah yeah for a particular
spectrum of white balance you're able to
make you're here you're able to make the
sensor on a camera a view light and
certainly in a certain way
lower kelvin readings will create a more
looky hyar cover me was incredible ready
ready okay or yellow which is why nikon
I cannon shooting slightly different
color modes exactly the way that they
interpret why balance is a little
different and that's why LG said a lot
of great stuff about the camera because
a lot of its very true you can't have
low aperture but also very small sensor
yeah that makes sense and you can't have
high megapixels and a small sensor so
the sensor on the g4 Lex you a little
bit bigger which makes complete sense to
me and thank God some 150 white balance
on the other hand it's just the way that
the camera sensor interprets the light
so let's say you had a you have sunlight
coming from a window we also had a
yellowish all yeah light going on the
same source you could hit the auto the
auto white balance and you can find it
but then you can also do the other thing
where you can put a white piece of paper
in front of your lens and you tell it
interpret this as y based upon right
lucky what was it like you would with an
SLR like how he would set the white
balance or you know use the high dropper
and Lightroom or whatever I'm sure wish
on some level I do think the color
spectrum center is trying to do without
really having a white dog scored but to
be honest like they had a white balance
car available then you know if they said
that they could do that functionality I
think that'd be even better what about
we didn't talk about this on the weekly
but what about the the IR functionality
built into the color sensor
how it sees the world visually yeah
that's amazing the IRS yeah that's the
color spectrum symptom yeah so is that
what's what's enabling all this a little
bit i feel ya but even even than just
having the full color gamut in the white
balance reading my box leader it's just
a feature of good candy the more the
more we talk about it the more I'm
really convinced that LG's it knows what
it's doing with your particular device
it call me Pete says never put a
cassette yeah yeah you know exactly
exactly and Samsung has yeah um and
they're doing this whole thing with with
cameras yes so do we know who makes the
sensor inside the g4 it wasn't specified
okay definitely not I wouldn't be
surprised if it was in house because you
can't just source the Sony assumed you
censored expect it to be a larger sensor
contigo them cellular I'll look it up
but didn't we don't know from one of the
links isn't it there there isn't because
this bubble screen is there's no that's
not nothing there yeah I don't know well
Bobby we will talk about the megaphone
we just returned and I was just saying
how awesome it is to see that LG's
really put a lot of thought into the
camera yeah yeah I mean it's cool i like
having the manual controls but again for
me like for smartphones and i think for
a lot of regular people you just want to
take something on your pocket and shoot
a good picture what just true about
having to worry about stuff like like
like the the decisions that it's
automatically making on that this scene
i shot it throw those people that
see what we're doing here I showed a
picture a photo there was the Sun
setting behind like a skyline over here
and there was like glare on the water
and there was like random lights and it
made like they look like it made the
right decisions as to what to what to
expose properly you mean like hey I
don't know I like that in a camera and
that's how they make us all ours
nowadays get to the point where like you
just put in manual mode scope just take
your photos of them sorry auto mode yeah
I don't know why I said manual mode I'm
sorry I mean I just want to take it out
and shoot a good picture yeah but I
suppose even there are a lot of people
that will use the raw stuff and design
mode and from from a marketing
perspective you know to be able to tell
people that oh here are all the settings
that go into what create your auto photo
and you could give and that's actually a
really good thing to do for lg's to have
that thing that they can mark it with
and say that you know you tell an
average person like my mom and I use her
as my benchmark for to know the common
person right because she's into tech not
as much as I am but she like listens to
me and what I you know suggest to her so
she if somebody were to advertise and
say oh it's got these manual controls
for the camera that would instantly I
feel like that would make somebody who's
just kind of a common tech user thank
you well no I think it would just make
them think like oh it has something very
special about it that all like the keep
the nerds like to use like it must be
something you know ya know can't thought
that people would think that too yeah
nokia has other problems I mean that's
Windows Phone that's a different
ecosystem we're talking
android air no no no that no that's
exactly my point it didn't doesn't
matter all that is irrelevant they
thought they could sell that phone based
purely on the fact that the camera was
amazing and while they did sell some it
wasn't nearly we're talking about a
whole but that's because windows phone
is it just yeah this one's Holly guys
instead of the Dead been ahead that ship
with Amber obviously wouldn't have sold
more units I'm not disputing that do you
think it would have been a best-seller
well if that was the first phone that
Nokia put out on hand droid yeah nothing
probably not because they have to
establish themselves as a threat again
and also that chassis is just too thick
it's a warthog yeah but I guess what I'm
saying is that i don't i don't agree i
think that people see manual controls on
a camera and they say oh god I don't
know how to work that at all I don't
know what to what to do with it now I
just want something that takes a great
picture when I fired up I think this
would be this this manual patrol thing
appeals to you know photo gigs sure and
that's a segment that I don't frankly
don't know how big it it is ok I can see
that being the case you know I guess
this is just me expressing my excitement
yeah I'm not saying you're wrong don't
you be wrong I'm just saying you know i
like how would how will it affect the
sales I don't think focus I finally
started looking at assoc android
smartphone cameras at this particular
lens it was looking at it in the sense
that a lot of what we're seeing in these
sensors made for smartphones it's
basically just on the software side how
the company interprets let's say a
cloudy or incandescent white balance and
then sort of shades it like a filter
what the sensors able to make this
sensor on the other hand because these
manual controls are so low class make me
feel like this was a real deal so large
not just not really DSLR like
construction but something that was made
with that integration it was well
thought out yeah very well thought I
think that what I'm changing some of the
settings in there something's actually
having in that Lance something
mechanical is happening at me there you
can show me all day that any company
every come you doesn't swear they do
that really cool graphic where that the
lens comes out in like 18 fixes yeah
yeah but UCSB yeah but nothing really
really like those parts are really that
those parts are making your phone or
become what you're seeing and on the
manual mode when you change those
settings it actually changes on the
viewfinder not because of a software
thing but because those are actual
levels and units I actually feel like
I'm changing what would be the lens on
way too long so can I ask you and they
spent a lot of time talking about it at
the presentation it's been a lot of
times on with the camera yeah do you
think they'll they'll make it like one
of the primary legs of their ad campaign
for this thing they better and they all
mystic matter because one of the one of
them the main leg of LG's parking is
obviously work oh look at this this is
what Samsung did we're just as much
better but this camera is has has a lot
to offer and if you get the photo geek
segment the people who have cameras but
also use smartphones which is every
camera user then that's already a pretty
large segment no here's here's the other
thing though is that that segment
doesn't
equate to millions of phones sold yeah
true but you have to win your battles
where you can come if we're able to get
five percent that's five percent on top
of all the other people you already it's
awful but they need a cell now they need
to sell millions of phones to people
that just bought a galaxy s6 right then
that was what i was saying off for ya
yeah i saw the dog since you were back
like your thoughts on the g4 how did you
feel on the phone itself I'm a fan I
mean I think they did I think they did
enough to not call it a g3s doesn't have
to be asked well it's just it's a
metaphor right yeah yeah it's just
people get yeah like the one m9 is
really one mas yeah I mean it because it
doesn't sound as cool thing like when
I'm 8.5 right now or gay orgy 3.5 you
know what version 2 I think that I don't
know that the software is just kind of
whatever to me it's all the same but I'm
I'm excited about the cameras well the
display yeah it's new but it doesn't
really look that different to my eyes
at least right now the quad HD is just a
marketing thing at this point no but I
mean the quantum yeah oh yeah i mean
backseat to the Quantum's the thing is
it's like yeah whatever we did LG I get
it they can't go anywhere else they were
the first smartphone to ship with a quad
HD display yeah I can't go anywhere else
from that yeah they want to go for k
which is just absurd in my opinion sigh
agree so screw that you know I would
just if anything long-term I would like
to see just at the camera solid and the
battery solid because if the phone feels
good in the hands I think it feels
better because they're harder edges like
on the side of it then there were on the
g3 so you got a lot more sense of grip
like I'm not going to drop this then and
if you do go with the leather back as
much as I'm not a fan of it it is the
lock review kind of kind of questioning
yeah we talked about this on the last
podcast and I think what I meant by can
I ask you questions can I say a
statement I really wonder if people
would be calling at the g3s if it
weren't for the leather option I think
the leather option is what is protecting
LG from people is it different design
it's not really is a lot different
actually not that idea the front of it
looks like a one plus one yeah I
mentioned I yeah the front of it looks
like a one place only has a silhouette
well a number i don't really think good
oh come on do you remember when we were
reporting on the G flex 2 when I said
that yeah yes yeah but this is not look
like a sec exactly like you except it's
missing the curvature i well maybe we
were may be right but listen uh is a G
flex 2 that went in like a flat iron
yeah but at the same time they started
this this presentation with 10
minutes out hey remember smartphone
history remember
people used to do fun things like two
different designs and make different
hardware yeah nobody does it anymore
things are boring there's this phone
that looks a lot like this photo
released had Melissa leather one I
really think they would have been called
on the car before probably by me because
I wasn't had that to lean on it amended
by donor stickers plastic one looks a
lot like last night let me let me let me
break it down like this okay break it
down HTC had the one I made or you know
good good solid build and everything o
Allah blossom HTC releases the m9
different things in the m9 but not
different things that are better than
the MA here we have different things in
the g4 that are better than things that
were in the lid g3 so climb to the same
stuff but LG actually moved forward and
improvements where there were you know
failures last year and cows were
slaughtered a leather there you go I'm
sure we should have done a pun count
yeah we're starting the podcast load
that's like the first one we need to try
to do that earlier to it I guess yeah
you were tweeting me cow funds yeah i
was too you know saying like what is
this phone grasp it no one came i
actually in my hands on I had a header
that was um like an h2 header for a
section that was cows died for this
phone and I felt like that was maybe a
little bit too grim so I changed it in a
good night of coming for the person who
brought up 911 on my podcast I'm sorry
oh my god I just realized i did that I'm
sorry oh okay did you raise all these
objections when motorola released the
Moto X 2014 with all that's left so I
wasn't there because i was at Aoife yeah
what I mean like any other like no and I
ain't nobody jumped on
and I think the problem for it's because
I wasn't there and I realize it's a lame
excuse it's because I wasn't they didn't
sink like the work how did it go well
that's the thing in his LG LG made such
a big deal about how this is the same
leather that's like featured on me coach
bags or whatever not not coach I don't
know if that's really a brand that's the
same brand but they were saying it's the
same a boutique brands that you'd find
on Fifth Avenue you know and so that
makes me think okay that's how I to
premium death my date now we were saying
earlier that every few more
that is a different helicopter it isn't
yeah what is what it's just with the
helicopters are
there's actually a hospital nearby and I
airbackup at that holds like 30 day for
within Wilson's family is trying to get
off the island before the whole zombie
thing again they left Jaden mine oh I'm
sorry but uh boring ever being a
Scientologist anyway sorry way thoughts
of snow or not an Android we are not
responsible for come here um we didn't I
did mention really like the every g4
should come with a picture of the cow
that I came from oh we go that is so
California oh by the way where was this
cat this comes from Beatrice the bovine
inertia guys should come with a story
you know this is key for one day look at
on board Emily oh god ro I actually put
my hands on like there are vegetarians
and vegans are gonna be really bothered
by this no you desert Linda I mean
motorola nobody was father this is look
because he did see how we can talk about
genuine cow so angels or whatever eyes
can see a face to the name basically
yeah that people are having to shoulder
cars yeah I don't know that I means is
it's a mystery just awesome what every
with other oh yeah I mean some mystery
but you don't wanna think about it I
don't know them hamburger
I mean look at that yeah what about that
I mean I own leather boots okay I have a
pair of fries they're my favorite other
areas / phony yourself why are all gonna
be like the people argue PETA is gonna
throw paint on us 30 is after that's how
they retaliated throw pain away our
foundation I would never I would never
wear fur though first murder what's not
okay not in the cone yeah you know what
do you know what's at the base of that
fur coat Luther good yeah I mean yeah
but nobody has like actually like this
how jackets it's like I how we're out
for a jacket because they're just
discarding the fur and they're just
taking the skin and they're not using
this like I want to know are there is
the rest the cow being used for me like
are we using the in Texas really where
these guys already dead maybe they were
diseased in like this source the
prophecies no worse conversation really
I was here with my friends Michael flow
and Don thinking average gonna have a
chip on guys just talking about I 911
Peter this is what we have today this
week it's a debate nonetheless yes
indeed that is what matters 15 years I'm
rerunning for a political office is it
gonna come back yeah i was playing i'm
running for bart board in a couple years
like now they're gonna be like her that
time you talked about the cows
smartphone what does that through with
public transit I don't know so if
leather is not the choice that you want
to have with the Jeep
do you want to see other ones up here I
liked Dom's idea felt kind of know that
was so poor or like something like
fabric or something I don't know Wow
wouldn't it be cool if I you should vote
girl I did what is it I know that would
be boring at all it wouldn't I could not
be at all it would not be cool and I
would be them it would stick to my
jacket and then your car that you can
put a vulgar pet your dashboard slap it
on there yeah your GPS I'm not surprised
from the guys well the hell in its
ceramic do right it's ceramic ceramic is
a ceramic on top of polymer AKA plans
day okay it's a highly I didn't really
or is that the one that's like painting
a steel building a white oh okay it just
goes a little bit heavier and yet softer
to the touch I sort of ran yeah yeah
hold of code of ftp this mission yeah
damn why didn't I get some Adam testin I
didn't I yea sorry I just don't know you
Diggy that whole thing I think it'd be
really cool if a smartphone manufacturer
would let you send in like your own
fabric from joann's fabrics or whatever
and then they were just making a case
for ya that's the ultimate moto maker
she called me cause the California yeah
those from the bay area from hell I from
the gay area yeah yeah yes I say hello
lie but you the only one who said yeah
it originated where I'm from thank you
very much and yeah you're coming down in
LA to escape the bay area for I'm only
coming there cuz there's a Disneyland
yes you guys are why the people are mad
at the buses fair enough it's true so
okay I guess I know how much how long
you're probably gonna have to edit a lot
of this yeah we don't push your button
don't push your button now just keep
talking and edit it okay fair enough
I'll shanna gentleman here you're
channeling your your rush hour rush hour
renegades it was about to say yeah push
your button bow come on all right you
know what wait rush hour renegades is
that from full house sure yeah nice work
goes Uncle Jesse I can we please talk
about fuller house oh god you get you
get 30 second I'm kind of excited I
can't wait to watch full house I have to
say and I go on work trips my favorite
thing to do is like gets back to the
hotel on time and watch nick at nite
when full house is playing because i
don't have cable at home she's here sure
prince that's what I want yeah i was
watching first Prince last night this
episode with Carlton um tries to be
ghetto he goes to Compton and he gets
all oh yeah becomes all hood yo I'm
asleep oh yeah and then he goes on the
floor in mattress I don't watch fuller
house if they let Bob second piercing oh
god no no that would be a lot of bleep a
yeah that's good right I love that but
that would be so San Francisco and you
just complaining by the gentrification
that's happening in the mission right

he did even I know that and then wait
for the grim he does oh sorry that was
but yeah rest in peace uncle phil I'm

I oh it's so much fun I'm not doing it I
think
it's great yes we don't I don't have it
i disagree divided but this is gonna be
the first year that I'm not gonna
partake in all the junk food they have
every freakin floor huh oh the junk food
is the best part you just get cups and
cups of like little chocolate covered
espresso beans and pretzels and then
just fried egg approaches the pretzels
freaking a dude tom singer tom is
testing out the low light at
foreign-born 91.8 on point a 28-point a
run games you see they trademark that at
one point eight laser campti a merman I
don't know man I don't know I've been
taking a couple shots in the dark here
and it is not doing that magical thing
that I'm gonna say them a new word again
that Lumias used to do where it would
just make some like credible stuff ok
we're doing a little analysis on the
podcast here I mean it's not horrible
let's put with that there for sure it is
kind of crazy yeah i mean if i had an f
1.8 lens and shout that on a like a an
SLR did you know it would be pretty good
i just use the perfect but it would also
mean that you need higher is slower
shutter speed which is what we're seeing
on that form something is wrong with us
I used the main camera on this phone to
take a picture of my face listeners and
it it's making me look like Charlie
Sheen at Ferris Bueller's Day Off let me
see good wait Charlie Sheen was in
ferris bueller's day off yeah he was the
truggy at the under oh the sister anyway
uh I tweeted this podcast is going off
the rails hahahaha in the dark it wants
to overexpose the highlights sure and
that's a really common thing yeah but
there are some cameras that put that
have some weight yet but I know what the
comment becoming it looks it's still
it's almost good yeah looks good but we
are taking pictures in the dark of lit
things I would much rather try and get a
shot of an unlit thing and that's the
thing like what people need to
understand that's the thing that I
really hope the manual what makes people
understand is that even in it DSLR if I
were to take a picture of let's say this
rearrangement very little like the back
on even anything shining on it with a F
1.7 lens right it would still not look
that great no I had to do it like a four
second exposure to get some light on it
and then it was just all crazy and
that's exactly what I was in DSLR zai
again just like my point before where
people are spoiled by the word of
limited p.m. are spoiled by smartphone
cameras because like LG said smartphone
cameras are trying to take away or Colby
the photographer noticing yeah he said
smartphones are trying to take away all
of the work that us photographers had to
learn to perfect this craft and if this
megaload educates people as to why the
photos are turning out the way that they
are then I'm all for it I I completely
agree with you um because I said at the
same thing about an in dead yeah I'm
going back to the 1020 but I'm not
trying to argue that this is the tenth
money yeah i'm just saying i wanted that
phone to arouse a consciousness in
people that like hey there is more to
photography than you then just point and
shoot and you should learn it to better
yourself and maybe makes a better art
yeah and I sort of expected I didn't
expect that to happen but I wanted that
to happen and for a short time having a
camera as powerful as that made me want
to take better pictures yeah well I
guess that fades away every other novels
I just want take that oh well what up
keep it is just like I don't really
shoot my vacation photos my DSLR as much
as I used to just three too much upkeep
yeah yeah there is there is a lot of
there alive use cases that when
like I was saying earlier I didn't have
my DSLR me when I was in Seattle because
he has six reform so long I did right
and if the LG g3 g4 rather is uh is
capable of doing that then that just
means that the manual mode is the icing
on top yeah work that's what I'm where I
like that we are pretty much going to
end on that profound melt because if we
were going off the rails I'm going to
tell I'm gonna tell everybody in the
intro of that you know yeah we went off
the rails a lot but there's a really
great point at the end so stick around
yeah I think though that are the
tangents really transitioned nicely like
they were like it wasn't just like oh
let's talk about this you know and then
it is we had different segues enjoy your
shirt into the randomness nothing else
is gonna be a great endurance test for
the people who listen to show everything
that through that junky metal woman's
haha i'm talking about 911 only to talk
about cow deb and TJ event easier but
you know that's our Marc Maron's podcast
is the WTF podcast that's what I'm
saying I wanted this one of this podcast
22 to have a comfort to it you know so
even when my team and I are on the
podcast we end up talking about random
stuff we spent 20 minutes last week just
talking about III because we're going

gonna go tonight I think I just want to
go to just have fun you know so that
other thing i don't like good it's a
convention i can go to and I'm not
obligated to do anything we talked about
