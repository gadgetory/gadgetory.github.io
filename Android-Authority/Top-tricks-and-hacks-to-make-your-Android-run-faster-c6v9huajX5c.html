for your phone to do stuff then watch
this video so as your phone starts to
get sluggish and slow it could get
really annoying and you might be
thinking about throwing it out or
smashing it but before you do that keep
in mind there's a few tweaks and tricks
you can use to get a little bit more
performance and speed back out of it
to make it perform like new again
potentially in this video we're going to
be looking at some of the best hacks and
tricks you can use to get the best
performance out of your device and you
might be surprised by just what a
difference some of these can make so the
first thing you need to do to ensure
you're getting the best performance
possible out of your device is to make
sure it's up to date that means that if
google has rolled out a new version of
Android and it's available on your
device you want to install that because
sometimes that'll give you a performance
boost you might also find that your
manufacturer has got some updates if
you've got a UI skin on top of your
phones can help to speed things up as
well and likewise if there's a
particular app that you're noticing is
starting to chug then make sure that's
up-to-date too because sometimes
updating the app itself can bring much
better performance but if that's not an
option then something else you can do is
to install a custom ROM and this is an
alternative to the official operating
system and firmware that's provided by
your manufacturer and normally it comes
from the open source community often
these come with a significant
performance upgrade lots of cool
features and things but it does carry
some risk you're going to need a root
access and if you get it wrong there's a
small chance of breaking your device
however if you were thinking of getting
rid of your device anyways and if it's
no longer being supported by your OEM
then this is a good way to get a little
bit more life and performance out of it
and potentially to upgrade to the latest
version of Android if it's available for
the model you've got there's tons of
articles on the website about custom
roms about flashing a device about root
access so I'll leave some links in the
description down below for you should
you want to go that route another handy
tip is to clear up your homescreen
especially if the slow performance you
noticing is whilst browsing through the
UI so this means making sure there
aren't too many big widgets down there
making sure that you don't have
unnecessary feeds from whatever junk
samsung stuffed on there turn all that
off better yet make sure that your home
screen is just one screen with a few
icons on it maybe in the folders and
your phone will be much quicker to use
and much less likely to stutter when
you're swiping through and browsing
around your UI
likewise choosing a different launcher
can
sometimes improve the performance okay
so now we're gonna get a little bit more
technical the first one though is a old
trick that most of you already know
we're going to switch off the animations
or at least turn them down so to do this
you're going to need to go into the
developer options on your device and to
find that you first need to access to
turn on the developer options menu in
your settings so to access developer
options you need to go into your
settings menu find where it says build
number and tap on this seven times if
you get it right it will say something
like congratulations you're now
developer and if you go back you'll now
have a new option to go into the
developer settings and here you can find
all sorts of cool stuff but the one
we're interested in is animation scale
and if you head over here you'll see
that there's animation scale for things
like window resizing and opening and
closing and if you turn those all off
then it's going to remove the animations
that you normally see when you know you
click on an app and it kind of zooms in
to it or when you exit and it shrinks
minimizes instead it's just gonna spring
to life and appear in front of you this
can sometimes look a little bit jarring
but it also speeds things up because
obviously there's no need to play a
pretty animation that's less for your
system to do and it's less time between
clicking on something and something
happening don't leave this menu just yet
though because there's a few cool
options in here another one is forced
GPU rendering and if you toggle that to
on what that means is that your phone
will now use the GPU by default to
render any graphics any 2d graphics such
as menu such as icons a lot of apps will
already do this but some won't and by
switching to the GPU which is a graphics
processing unit specifically intended
for this kind of processing you can
speed things up and also lighten the
load on the CPU doing this may drain
your battery just slightly but you might
also notice that some apps are quicker
try it out if you think it's a decent
compromise and stick with it and if you
don't like it you can always just turn
it back off again might also find an
option here to switch your GPU rendering
engine to skier instead of default this
is something else to try out which might
give you improved performance some
people will say it does for them other
people not so much I personally found
that it negatively affected performance
whilst I was using the dolphin emulator
on the Nokia 8 Sirocco but your mileage
may vary and as some people have luck
with it give it a go again and if it
works for you
right those last two options might help
you with gaming then but if you want to
improve your speed browsing then you
should try turning on data saving in
Chrome
data saving basically compresses things
like images and videos before showing
them to you on your browser and this
could not only save your data as the
name implies but also help pages to load
more quickly one option that you hear
quite a lot for improving your UI
experience is to clear out your cache so
the cache is a space that your device
uses to store files and settings and
things that it might need later the idea
is to actually improve performance by
providing information very quickly ready
to access rather than having to be
loaded from scratch each time for
instance in Chrome the cache will store
things like images and files so they
don't need to be downloaded every time
you visit a website that you regularly
go to the problem is that over time the
cache can become too full and not only
does this take up unnecessary space on
your device but it can also cause them
to become slow because files become
corrupted or lost etc it needs to dig
through all that data you can remove
cached data individually by going to
your settings menu finding app info
storage and then clear cache or you can
use an app specifically designed for
managing memory such as ccleaner but I
will say at this point you shouldn't go
too crazy with this because if you go
overboard and keep clearing your cache
and you'll actually slow things down
because like I say the point of the
cache is to ensure that your phone runs
smoothly by providing files that it's
gonna need easily and readily available
just as you shouldn't keep clearing your
cache you also should avoid using task
killers so those apps that are running
in the background when you go into your
multitasking menu they're not actually
causing any problem they're paused and
they're kept in the memory so that you
won't when you want to use them again
it's easy to just resume without having
to boot them up from scratch task
killers that keep removing anything
running in the background
anything pause any pause processes that
means that then you're gonna have to
load those apps back up from scratch
each time you want to use them this
actually takes more processing power
it's actually slower and it actually
takes up more battery so they're
actually causing more harm than good if
you have a task and you think it's
helping you think it's speeding up your
phone it's probably because you have one
misbehaving app that's being closed or
several misbehaving apps but far better
than killing everything is just to find
what those apps are I'll either change
this
settings or uninstall them that said
some background services you don't want
background services are things that run
in the background but without you being
visibly aware of them so for instance
your SMS app will have a background
service because it needs to listen out
for text that incoming although you've
closed the app it's still running in the
background these apps are useful so you
want them but some apps will take
advantage of that feature to find out
which apps have access to the background
services head back into your developer
options and go to background check and
there you can see which ones have
permission and if you see something here
that is using a background service and
you don't know why just turn it off if
it negatively affects the performance of
that app then you can just turn it back
on but otherwise you've just saved
yourself some unnecessary work and
hopefully sped up your phone a bit and
saved battery life one of the things
that really does slow down your device
and use that battery is downloading
large files in the background or
installing new apps and you'll have
noticed this yourself if you've ever got
a new phone go on to install all your
favorite apps and then start using it
and it'll start stuttering which is
unfortunately not the best impression of
a brand new device this is why auto sync
can be a problem so an app with auto
sync is regularly checking the web for
new information to download to make sure
that is up-to-date this is a good thing
so for instance Gmail has Auto sync so
that you make sure that you have all the
latest emails in your inbox each time
you check but at the same time some apps
will regularly auto sync you don't
really need them too maybe you only
means them to auto sync once a day
rather than once every half hour so
check the auto sync settings and each
app through their own settings menus and
turn off anything you don't need because
that is sucking up power and using a
battery before all of this doesn't work
and you're really looking to get the
very best performance out of your device
especially for gaming then you might be
interested in overclocking your device
Gary's done some great videos and what
overclocking means so I'll link to those
in the description down below PC games
will be familiar with the idea it
basically means that you're getting more
performance out of your CPU by
overriding the restrictions that are
imposed by OEMs obviously they're there
for a reason you can end up overheating
your device damaging the internals so
you need to know what you're doing you
need to be careful and you need to
understand the risk but if you have a
rooted device and you download the right
apps then you can do this relatively
safely as long as you know what you're
doing
and get a bit more performance out of
your device which you can actually
notice in gaming and other real-life
applications and finally if none of that
works then just burn it all to the
ground one more thing you can try is
just to set your phone back to factory
settings that will remove all bloat
where they will remove all settings that
you might have changed by accident that
could be slowing things down and it's
your best chance of making your phone
perform as new because in theory it is
as new and then from there you can try
using all of these little tricks that
I've just shared but this time from
blank slate and now you're going to have
the fastest phone you possibly could
have so thanks ton for watching guys
hope found some video useful and
interesting if you did then please leave
like please share around that helps us
out immensely and comment down below to
let us know what other hacks and tricks
you can use to speed up your device
