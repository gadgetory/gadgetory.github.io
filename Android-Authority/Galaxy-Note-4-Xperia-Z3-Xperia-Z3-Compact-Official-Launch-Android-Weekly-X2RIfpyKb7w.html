brought to you by full sail university
welcome back to android weekly my name
is jason and this past week android
authority was in Berlin for the ephah
conference and they got their hands on a
smorgasbord of new phones so no more
rumors no money alright let's start off
with the star of the show that is the
Galaxy Note 4 but the question is will
it meet up with the hype or will it be
anticlimactic like the galaxy s5 to be
clear the note 4 is very similar in
appearance to the note 3 before it with
the same general shape approximate
dimensions and styling however the thin
metal band going around its edges gives
the note for a much better feeling in
the hand it's not that it's much thinner
than its predecessor but the slightly
tapered profile and the chamfered edges
of the metal frame make it feel more
compact than it really is pop the back
off and you'll see the standard
removable battery microSD card and the
micro-sim slot unlike the galaxy s5 the
note 4 isn't waterproof when we ask
Samsung's reps why they said the note
force for people interested in being
productive and creative on the go why
the galaxy s5 is a more generalists
device the big story about the note 4's
display is the quad HD resolution at
five point seven inches and 2560 x 1440
pixels that gives it a whopping pixel
density of 515 PPI this is the same
bright and vivid AMOLED panel Samsung
loves to put on its high-end offerings
so now the question is will the king of
phablets make phablet fanatics happy let
me know the comments below now Samsung
has proven that they won't shy away from
innovative technologies even if that new
innovative technology is a bit gimmicky
meet the Galaxy Note edge the plastic
based AMOLED display looks great and the
edge brings a whole new set of unique
features the device keeps similar specs
with the Galaxy Note 4 save for the
obviously larger screen that means you
get a whole new set of note for specific
changes and improvements like the
multitasking
and the new S Pen features as well as
some edge specific additions as well
aside from bringing us a different look
on the front side thanks to the edge
display Samsung has now moved its now
iconic right side power button to the
top otherwise the design is relatively
similar to the note 4 complete with the
faux leather on the back as for the
screen the edge part of the screen can
be used for notifications playback
controls News sports scores and can even
be a night clock that can be used
without turning the main part of the
display on thanks to the fact that it is
an AMOLED screen now as of today there's
no word yet as to pricing and
availability but it's safe to expect
that this will come at a premium even
compared to the note for now for all you
Xperia fans out there you should know
that Sony released its flagship device
that is the Sony Xperia z3 and it looks
thinner and slicker when it comes to the
design language the Xperia z3 will
definitely remind you of its predecessor
with its overall angular design but it
does come with a more refined look to it
with rounded sides and corners the
bezels have also been reduced resulting
in a device that is slightly smaller
than the experience e2 while also being
thinner everything else is largely the
same with the iconic large silver power
button returning and a dedicated camera
shutter button returning also did you
guys know that by 2015 it's expected
that mobile development projects will
outnumber native pc projects by four to
one yeah that's a doozy if you want to
take advantage of that demand that's
where beloved sponsor comes in Full Sail
University if you were interested in a
future in tech mobile is where it is at
and Full Sail University's online and
on-campus mobile development bachelor's
program can teach you the skills you
need to take advantage of these emerging
opportunities through full sales project
lunchbox program students receive a
macbook pro industry software plus iOS
and Android devices so if you're ready
to take some action and not just talk
about it go to full sail edu /a thority
more about these degree programs good
luck now the thing I was looking forward
to the most was the Sony Xperia z3
compact and Sony did not disappoint the
compact comes equipped with a four point
six inch 720p display 2.5 gigahertz
quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 801
processor 2 gigabytes of ram 16
gigabytes of internal storage at 20.7
megapixel rear facing camera with a 2.2
megapixel front facing camera and a 2600
milliamp hour battery now according to
josh the device feels just as good as
the Exodia experience III safe work
being a bit more plasticky around the
edges and of course smaller its specs
are also great which keep the device
running as smooth as butter but we can
see some specs being downgraded when
compared to the experience III but we
can also say these changes have their
benefits as 720p resolution continues to
look great and a four point six inch
display not to mention this makes the
job easier for that 2600 milliamp hour
battery now personally if I could get
that baby as a google play edition phone
that might be the near-perfect android
phone to date thanks for watching
android army love to connect with you
right here on google+ or twitter you
don't to forget about my brothers and
android and if you haven't seen the
video i just finished on the next big
leap forward you can watch that right
there at the top I worked really hard on
it and there are hundreds of comments of
people who agree with me about with the
next big leap forward and those who
don't love to hear your opinion I will
be reading those comments I shall see
you next week on Android weekly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
