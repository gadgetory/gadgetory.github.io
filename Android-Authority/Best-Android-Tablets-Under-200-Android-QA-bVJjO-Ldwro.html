Jason this is where we try and answer
your most pressing Android questions
like Santa yeah the big guys come into a
chimney near you in the next two months
but whether you've been naughty or nice
you may not have the 530 stones to drop
on the Nexus 9 as gorgeous as it is so
today's Q&amp;amp;A is all about the best
entry-level Android tablets sub 200
bucks we'll take good care of you so
right at the top of that list even
though it's a year old we got to talk
about the Nexus 7 and here's why the
Nexus 7 2013 edition has a quad-core
Snapdragon s4 processor clocked in at
1.5 gigahertz and backed by an Adreno
320 GPU it has two gigabytes of RAM and
is still more than capable of handling
all but the most intensive activities
its display resolution is still the
highest you can get in this size
category and most importantly you get
instant Android updates then that
includes the all new Android 5.0
lollipop this is why the Nexus 7 2013
Edition opens up at the best of our
cheap Android tablet list the other
thing to note about the Nexus 7 is that
now that the Nexus 9 has come out we
expect that the Nexus 7 2013 edition
will be dropped in price watch out for
that now if you're looking for a decent
build quality at an affordable price you
may want to consider the LG G pad 7.0
the LG G pad 7.0 is a great example of a
budget-friendly device offering a solid
feel and build quality while made
entirely of plastic it has a matte
finish which is less prone to fingertips
not only is the G pad very sturdy it's
also light overall in the specifications
Department you get a processing package
that is becoming increasingly common
with the current crop of mid-range
devices as we see from similar devices
the performance is actually quite good
this LG G pad sports a 7 inch IPS LCD
display with 1280 x 800 resolution with
216 PPI it has a 1.2 gigahertz quad-core
Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor with
an Adreno 305 GPU it has one gigabyte of
eight gigabytes of storage but that
storage is expandable it has a three
point one five megapixel rear facing
camera and a 1.3 megapixel front-facing
camera and it sports a 4000 milliamp
hour battery now when we're talking
mid-range Android tablets we got to talk
about the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 7.0
Samsung's signature design language
makes a return here along with TouchWiz
and it's key features such as smart stay
and multi window the Samsung Galaxy Tab
4 7.0 is not without its shortcomings
however just like any other low-cost
tablet but if you're looking for a
Samsung tablet at a very reasonable
price this device may be for you now
just because we're considering budget
tablets it doesn't mean we have to
sacrifice on sound at least according to
lanova
and that's where they come in with the
idea tab a8 what makes this tablet stand
out is the availability of front-facing
speakers powered by Dolby Digital
offering some great sound whether you're
listening through your headphones or the
speaker's themselves while the
specifications are quite standard fare
across the board it has a near stock
android 4.4 kitkat allowing for smooth
and snappy software experiences there's
a lot of things that this tablet does
pretty well and even if it does have its
flaws at the end of the day the idea tab
a8 is very competitively priced it
sports an 8 inch IPS LCD display with
1280 x 800 resolution with only 189 PPI
it has a 1.3 gigahertz quad-core
MediaTek processor 1 gigabyte of RAM 8
or 16 gigabytes of internal storage that
is expandable and has a 5 megapixel rear
facing camera and a 2 megapixel front
facing camera and of course it has the
42 hundred million power battery alright
thanks for watching Edward army my name
is Jace and I would love to connect with
you right here on Google+ or Twitter but
I have a gift for you today that's right

inbox I talked about last week that

invites I ran out I gave them all away
but Google's giving me three more and I
want to give them to you but I need your
help I'm looking for topics to cover on
the next Android Q&amp;amp;A
need three things one it needs to be a
topic I haven't covered before or a new
slant on an old topic and two it needs
to help a broad spectrum of people so it
can't be a question like when does my
device get Android lollipop no needs to
help a lot of people and three it needs
to be interesting or fun in some way if
you can put that in the comments below I
will choose the top three suggestions
that I like and I will give you Google
