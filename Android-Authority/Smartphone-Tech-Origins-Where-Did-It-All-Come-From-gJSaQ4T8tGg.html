different things they can play music
take photos provide GPS navigation they
can scan our fingerprints and a whole
lot more and it's really impressive how
much technology is packed into such a
small package but where did all the
technology that we see in our
smartphones today come from let's take a
look let's kick things off with how the
mobile phone was born it seems like
mobile phones have been around forever
but mobile phones didn't exist until
1973 and it wasn't until 1983 that the
very first mobile phone became
commercially available with the Motorola
DynaTAC 8000x which weighed in at over
four pounds and went on sale for almost
four thousand dollars sort of makes the
thousand dollar smartphone in 2017 look
like chump change SOC s from Qualcomm
Apple Samsung and other manufacturers
are the brains of our devices and it's
ultimately what makes everything tick
but you'd be surprised to know that the
very first SOC was not in a computer at
all but instead found in a Hamilton
pulsar digital watch this was unveiled
on the Johnny Carson show in 1970s OCS
didn't make their debut in mobile
devices until 2008 with the QSC 7230 by
Qualcomm and since then they have
evolved to using smaller and smaller
transistors and pushing their physical
limits in terms of nano meter spacing
GPS was first developed for the US
Department of Defense and it wasn't
until 1989 that the first GPS system was
made commercially available by a company
called Magellan navigation in 1999 the
benefi Escape was the first commercially
available phone with GPS technology
personal GPS systems didn't become
available until the early 2000s but they
were quite expensive from companies like
Garmin and TomTom eventually the rise of
smartphones in the late 2000s
incorporated GPS and led to dedicated
GPS systems becoming almost obsolete
although fingerprints have been used as
a method of biometric recognition since
the Babylonian period it wasn't that
long ago that they made their appearance
in mobile devices the first smartphone
offered this technology was the Motorola
Atrix 4G back in 2011 Apple filed suit
in 2013 with the iPhone 5s and since
then a ton of manufacturers have adopted
this technology
x4g primarily uses technology for
identification and to bypass the lock
screen but nowadays our fingerprint can
be used as a method for paying for goods
and services and authenticating various
applications on our smartphones the
touchscreen may seem like a relatively
recent technology but the very first
touch screen was introduced way back in
1965 by an inventor named EA Johnson it
took almost 30 years before this
technology finally reached our phones
with the first phone with a touchscreen
being the IBM Simon in 1992 this
technology would advance further and
further over the next few years
eventually evolving into the smartphones
we have today many people probably think
that the first iPhone was the very first
smartphone to feature a capacitive
touchscreen but it was actually the LG
Prada although Apple most likely played
a big role in popularizing the use of
capacitive touch in smart phones so that
wraps up our list of smart phone tech
origins but obviously there are a ton
more we could talk about if you want to
