Authority and today we're going to talk
a little bit about HTC and HTC is a
company that's been around for a very
long time but they've certainly seen
much better times their market share in
the US has dwindled year-over-year
quarter-over-quarter and with the
smartphone landscape being a lot more
competitive now than it was five to ten
years ago it's going to be a lot harder
to regain that market share but I think
they can do it so that's what we're
going to talk about we're going to talk
about how HTC can comeback and the
things that they would need to change or
do in order to make that happen so the
first thing I want to talk about is
gimmicks and when I say gimmicks I'm
talking about the good type of gimmick
that actually makes the phone better and
adds to the user experience like a
vessel screen dual cameras or
quote-unquote modular snap-on parts and
HTC does have their own gimmick with the
edge Sense technology on the u11 but I
think it just needs one more thing to
truly make the phone stand out I would
love to see an HTC phone with a bezel
with screen that would be awesome and
would fall more in line with what
Samsung and LG are offering so if HTC
can figure out what that one extra
gimmick would be it would make their
smartphones that much more compelling
coming in at number two is the price and
HTC's current flagship the u 11 cost
$650 unlocked right now which is pretty
average for a flagship phone but in HD
sees current situations they definitely
could afford to lower that price by a
hundred to $150 to give them a little
bit more of a competitive edge over
other companies like Samsung LG or even
Apple and if they really want to compete
and regain some of that market share
lowering the price of their phones to
sell more units would definitely help
out a lot next up on the list is carrier
availability so if you look at the HTC u
11 right now it's only being sold
directly from one US carrier that
carrier being Sprint but Sprint is one
of these smaller carriers out of the big
four and if you look at a company like
Google they actually did the same thing
would be pixel but they at least pick
the biggest carrier out of the four with
Verizon but the best thing for HTC to do
if they really want to cell phones and
regain
some of that lost market share is to get
their phone across all four major US
carriers this is something that they did
really well in years past so hopefully
this is something they can improve upon
with flagship phones in the future last
but not least let's talk about
advertising and marketing because right
now HCC's marketing is practically
non-existent
I mean when was the last time you saw an
ad for agency on TV or a billboard for
HTC you see that type of stuff for Apple
and Samsung all the time and that's the
reason why they hold the most market
share and it's not like HTC hasn't tried
marketing their products before in the
past they've even brought in big-name
celebrities like Robert Downey jr. and
Gary Oldman with that really weird blah
blah blah campaign but those type of
advertisement didn't really appeal to
well to consumers the advertisements
that I think work best are the ones that
simply just tell you about the phone and
pique your interest and that's what
Apple ads and Samsung Ads do really well
so if HTC sort of takes a similar
approach I think they will have a lot
more success with selling their phones
because ultimately that is the name of
the game but what do you guys think am I
completely off my rocker here or do you
agree or disagree let me know down in
the comments below but please keep
things positive there's already enough
negativity in this world
the last place we need it is in the
comments section of YouTube but that's a
