devices of two top Korean manufacturers
and we're also going to learn that even
though at first glance they might seem
very different they're actually
incredibly alike aids Josh of Agartha
Madrid Authority what's going on
everybody and this is the Samsung Galaxy
s4 versus the lg optimus G pro the
differences and similarities definitely
begin with the design from a first
glance you'll see that the Optimus G pro
is quite larger than the Galaxy s4 while
the s4 might span just about 5.3 inches
tall the Optimus G pro takes on a
profile much like the samsung galaxy
note 2 and gets almost up to 6 inches
tall and is about a third of an inch
wider once you get either phone in your
hand and get past the size difference
these two phones end up being incredibly
alike the first thing you'll notice is
the plastic material that both phones
employ button layouts are very similar
to the only real difference is the cue
button found above the volume rockers on
the Optimus G pro that can be programmed
for a number of shortcuts obviously the
Optimus G pro is much harder to handle
with one hand than the galaxy s4 due to
its larger and heavier size while the s4
is the best handling five-inch screen
device available right now the G pro is
a five and a half inch screen device
definitely meant to be handled mostly by
two hands with such similar looks and
button layouts it really comes down to
size here ultimately if you want to keep
the handling as easy as possible then
the Galaxy s4 is probably the one for
you should you really want a bigger size
though then obviously you can go for the
G pro but the device you choose will
very likely be influenced by factors
outside of just sheer design and one of
those factors will indeed be the
displays while there is a half-inch
difference in the size of either screen
both sport about the same specifications
the Super AMOLED display of the samsung
galaxy s4 is a 1080p display rated at
441 PPI it is a great display with very
saturated looks that compliment the
looper colorful motif of Samsung's
TouchWiz UI it's no surprise that this
is one of the best examples of how much
fun you can have on a 5-inch display
with that in mind however imagine if
that screen was even larger the less
saturated 5.5 inch true IPS display of
the Optimus G pro is
so capable of 1080p resolution but is
instead rated for 401 PPI this lowered
pixel density is honestly a very small
difference though text is thus rendered
very well either way and videos pictures
and games are undoubtedly enjoyable no
matter which device you use in practice
the main difference again is just the
size if bigger truly means better for
you especially when it comes to media
then the G Pro will definitely fulfill
your requirements otherwise five inches
has proven to be a great size for a
smartphone display and can still prove
very enjoyable for your viewing pleasure
once again we see just how much these
two devices are alike through their
performance we are speaking specifically
of the western version of the samsung
galaxy s4 and thus we're talking about
the snapdragon 600 clocked in at 1.9
gigahertz and backed by the adrenal 320
and two gigabytes of RAM it is certainly
a wonderful performer that allows you
super-fast experiences and multitasking
while the optimus G pro did come out a
little before the s4 it was one of the
first devices to support the snapdragon
600 and it rocked it quite well clocked
in at 1.7 gigahertz it is also backed by
the audrina 320 and two gigabytes of RAM
thus you get very similar and still very
fast performance in the G pro while it
does score lower than the s4 though no
one can deny that the G pro is a very
similar performer to the s4 performance
is just another category that fails to
make any real separations between these
two smartphones luckily that just means
you won't be slowed down no matter which
of these two you choose LG and Samsung
put a lot of work into making these two
phones offer as much as possible well
start with the Samsung Galaxy s4 and
underneath its removable cover there is
a removable battery that allows for
replacements when power gets low and the
16 32 or 64 gigabytes of onboard memory
can be bolstered by the microSD card
slot an IR blaster allows the s4 to
control a host of different devices like
TVs or set-top boxes and finally its
unique bits include a host of sensors
used for navigation and some unique
applications going on to the back cover
of the Optimus G pearl you'll see that
it also sports a removable and
replaceable battery though it is a
larger one more on that in a bit it's 32
gigabytes of onboard memory is also
bolstered by the inclusion of a mic
SD card slot the G Pro also comes with
an IR blaster for controlling TVs and
related devices when it comes to sensors
unfortunately the G Pro doesn't have as
many as the s4 it sports the standards
like the gyroscope and the accelerometer
Eastern versions include a long antenna
for viewing broadcast television but
after that this is pretty much it while
the galaxy s4 brings more to the table
than the G Pro their applications depend
entirely on whether or not you will
actually use them as far as the actual
required bits for smartphone usage go
the G Pro has them all covered if you
want to take advantage of the unique
things the s4 offers then you can go
that route otherwise the G Pro is like a
standard smartphone on steroids it does
everything we're already used to in an
obviously bigger way as I mentioned
before the Optimus G pro sports a larger
battery to compensate for its larger
screen and body and it really is an
increase compared to the 2600 milliamp
hour battery found in the s4 you get a
whopping 30 140 milliamp hour unit in
the G Pro this big jumpin capacity
should allow the G pro to outlast the s4
when it comes to battery life
unfortunately this is only partially
true battery test showed that the
optimizations and power saving features
of the galaxy s4 helped it outlast the G
pro especially in media consumption
luckily a spare battery and charging
dock are included in the G pro package
while you could certainly buy a spare
battery for the s4 and have it handy at
least it comes as a standard with the G
Pro and now we come to the cameras the
Samsung Galaxy s4 sports a 13 megapixel
camera and the picture quality from it
is very good what details more than
adequately reproduced and colors given a
good level of saturation to make just
about any photo pop what the S 4 offers
most of is in the application itself or
many different modes can be used to make
your smartphone photography more fun
there are drama and eraser modes for
adding or subtracting subjects from your
pictures as well as dual recording modes
that to be fair or first shown in the
Optimus G pro dual recording on the s4
it does bring more borders and filters
however speaking of the Optimus G pro
camera it's 13 megapixel optics also
bring very good picture quality though
in this particular picture you can see
that it does not manage a depth of field
that the s4 s did details are captured
just as well though and the color
reproduction is also quite good the
application does
not offered quite as much as the one
found in the s4 but it does do HDR dual
recording and it's own version of
photosphere quite well once again the G
approach shows itself as a standard
smartphone on steroids doing what it is
expected to do very well while the s4
brings some unique features for those
who are looking to be more adventurous
either way you'll have a great photo
companion despite the G Pro not being
quite as pocketable as the s4 and
finally we have the software given that
thus far both LG and Samsung have
managed to pack a lot into their
flagships
this category is pretty much no
difference we'll start with TouchWiz the
all-too-familiar UI with new navigation
features gesture based sensors allow you
to move about browsers and galleries
with a wave of your hand and hovering
your finger allows for quick previews of
text or albums there are new
applications like s health and s
translator made to make your life easier
these all bolster included features like
the split screen which is a great
multitasking tool you either love or
hate TouchWiz though the new additions
definitely give it a freshness that it
has needed the Optimus UI is not as
bloated or colorful as TouchWiz but
packs a similarly large amount of
features while it does not have the
sensors the s4 has for a navigation many
little tools have been added and that
help with multitasking cue apps are
small applications like cue voice and
cue memo that you can put over your
current workspace for quick small tasks
you can for example browse the Internet
in one and take notes in the other the
cue button at the top left of the device
is another unique feature of the G Pro
which can be programmed as a shortcut
for opening applications or cue apps
ultimately what the Jeep relax and
sensors for navigation is made up for in
the cue button and the small overlay cue
apps you can't go wrong with
multitasking or customizing your
experience no matter which phone you get
so it comes down to whether or not the
new ways of navigating in the S form
makes it more attractive to you when
looking at these phones unlocked the
larger Optimus G pro comes with the
larger price tag as it is found for
close to $800 u.s. the galaxy s4 on the
other hand can be found for up to $700
u.s. when unlocked as far as contracts
go we'll use AT&amp;amp;T as our measure as both
phones are found on that carrier and
then both come in at $1.99 for two-year
contracts
and so there you have it these two
phones offer the most and the best that
their respective manufacturers have so
far managed in the smartphone market
it's really hard to argue the main
factors like display and performance
because both phones give largely the
same great experience it comes down to
software offerings and the sizes the s4
does bring a few more unique features to
the table and it's smaller size may be
more appealing to general users however
some really want the larger screen and
the G pro handles typical smartphone
usage with ease in the end it is up to
you which phone will better complement
your lifestyle the takeaway here though
is that Samsung's Galaxy Note 3 is on
the way with the Optimus G pro crowding
the space it once reigned over we could
be seeing great things from the next
