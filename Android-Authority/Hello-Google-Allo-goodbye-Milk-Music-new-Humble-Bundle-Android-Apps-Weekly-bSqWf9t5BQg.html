handy the Android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly this
is episode number 159 so let's get right
into those headlines Samsung's milk
music was finally put to rest this last
week as of September 22nd this service
will no longer be available for download
or for use it shouldn't surprise anyone
because this was announced a couple of
months ago prior milk music users will
get a 14-day free trial to slacker radio
since that was the service that
originally powered milk music it's still
available in China and South Korea for
now but it won't last forever there
either
a study was released late last week that
showed that only 13% of all users
downloaded 50% of all of the apps this
makes a lot of sense because US early
adopters can and will frolic from one
application to the next to see if it's
any good another interesting stat is
that 49% of people in the survey didn't
actually download a single application
during the survey period on average
people interested in applications
download about 3.5 per month I tackle
that about every other day Google is
formerly blowing out amp for accelerated
mobile pages to everyone all around the
world starting this week for those who
don't know amp is a project to help web
pages load much more quickly and take up
far less data than their non amp
counterparts Google boasts that they've
done up to 600 amp sites already in 232
regions the only other thing of note is
that this won't change the search
results at all so you'll still see the
same searches now as you did last week
Yahoo sent out an email this week to
tell everybody about a data leak that
happened all the way back in 2014 on top
of being massively late to the party
Yahoo also revealed that they believed
the culprit behind the hacks was a
state-sponsored
actor and that it was more than just
account passwords that got taken they
didn't mention which state or country
the attack originated in but there are
really only a handful that target
us-based companies like Yahoo anyway of
course that also doesn't explain why it
took them two years to tell us about it
the latest Humble Bundle is now live and
this time around the bundle is based
around art effects movie games for both
PC and mobile you can pay whatever you
want and get three of the games beat the
average and get six total games or pay
more than $5 and get every game in the
bundle there are some good titles here
and it's also a great way to
to charity and play some awesome games
at the same time Paper Planes is a cute
little application where you can make a
paper airplane and then throw it into
the Internet it is then eventually
retrieved by somebody else
likewise you'll be able to catch planes
thrown by other people stamp your
location stamp on there and then throw
it back out again there is really not a
use for an app like this one and it
doesn't provide any functionality but it
is kind of fun to see how far your paper
airplane flew before it was caught by
somebody else it's completely free and
again it's not overly useful but it's
their construction crew 3d is a fun
little time killers that'll have you
driving around and using various
construction vehicles that includes
things like cranes dump trucks and other
various vehicles and you'll have full
control over their various implements of
destruction at its core construction
crew 3d is a puzzle game that'll have
you solving various puzzles in order to
progress to the next level it features
over 90 missions 15 vehicles that you
can drive and a whole lot more the free
version is ad supported and you can buy
the pro version as an in-app purchase
Google trips is a new application that
helps you plan your trips the central
idea is that it gives you a one-stop hub
for things like your itinerary
places of interest restaurant
reservations and other kinds of things
that you generally need when you take a
trip it'll also help you find stuff to
do if you're not 100% certain of what
you want to do once you get to wherever
it is it you're going it's fully
featured and it can even be accessed
offline in case you end up somewhere
without an internet connection you can
get it for free right now so flux is a
minimal puzzle game that a lot of people
seem to be enjoying right now the basic
premise of this one is that you have a
couple of waves that you need to line up
in order to make it look like the third
wave it sounds easy when you say it out
loud but it does get rather difficult
rather quickly it's a great little time
killer for those who like puzzles
perhaps the best part of the game is
that it's completely free to play with
the in-app purchases being for developer
donations if you feel like you want to
give them a few bucks
Google alo was perhaps the most
anticipated application of 2016 and now
it's out to the public the application
features goofy little things like
stickers emoji and location messaging
while also providing a clean look and
feel a Lowe's main feature is Google
assistant which you can ping in its own
chats or in any chat where everybody is
using a low it's not amazing just yet
but word is that new features will be
coming rather swiftly you can pick it up
for free and if you want to learn more
we'll have
QuickLook video linked up in the video
description below this week's edition of

little social application that lets you
express your random thoughts and ideas
