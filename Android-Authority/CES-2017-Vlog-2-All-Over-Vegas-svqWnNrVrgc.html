let's all point of bringing a big team
right and you'll see the entire team at
some point at a municipal it's actually
pretty awesome that we have your own car
because we were able to go and do stuff
like this you don't have to rely on
taxis and cap and all that stuff and if
we I do have to drive some of the team
then that's fine I just don't to do that
too often we have a huge van that we
usually use you can have your 12 places
but in a pinch at nighttime your car
like right now we're about to go get
lunch everybody else is already house

people's internet is going to have to be
good enough to be able to take an Amish

data to take it like you're gonna have
to have gigabit or something if you want
