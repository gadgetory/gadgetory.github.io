made the commute into London to check
out the latest launch from Huawei under
the promise of free snacks they did not
disappoint there was shortbread biscuits
and alcohol there's also a ball pit
because of course there was phones are
predominantly marketed towards
Millennials now after all there was also
the honor nine light and with a total of
four lenses and a great price that
didn't disappoint either the other nine
light is a light version of the flagship
phone on a nine except from what I can
tell it's not that light it weighs
pretty much what you'd expect from a
smartphone lols that's my little joke
the honor nine light is light in the
same way that yogurt is light this is
your low fat on a9 meaning slightly
powered down specs for a more wallet
friendly price except it's not that
light in that sense either there's still
a lot of bang for your buck here specs
wise it's similar to the excellent on a
7 X with the 16 nanometer
octa-core keren 695 chipset so that's
still plenty nippy for general Android
stuff you'll get three gigabytes of RAM
and 32 gigabytes of storage around the
front there's a 5.6 5 inch edge to edge
IPS LCD display that's a to 160 P by
1080p resolution and an 18 by 9 aspect
ratio in keeping with 2018 design trends
in fact it's very similar to be on a 9
in its overall design and it feels very
premium in the hand there's that really
shiny back panel achieved with 2.5 d
glass that you'll find on all honor
devices and it comes in three attractive
colors while waste calling this
affordable premium sounds like a
contradiction in terms but it's actually
pretty hard to argue in this case
there's also a 3000 milliamp hour non
replaceable battery which should provide
some decent longevity a fingerprint
sensor located around the back for
secure access control and Android 8.0
Oreo for the operating system and that's
got the nui 8 skin on top of it which
has some smart memory management
features a little backwards facing
though is the notably absent USB type C
we get micro USB in its place which is a
shame there's no mention of water
resistance either but saving the best to
last the least delights part of this
phone is in the camera department you'll
get not two not three but four lenses
for your money
both the front and back cameras feature
a 13 megapixel primary shooter backed up
by a 2 megapixel secondary lens for
depth information that means boquete in
both directions from more glam
selfies and blowing your friends out of
the background of your shots there's
also better beautification which of
course I won't be needing in all
seriousness the portrait node is a lot
of fun and looks like a marked
improvement over the feature on the 7x
from my brief time with it in general
the cameras performed very well and even
in low-light settings on has been
packing all kinds of cool features into
their cameras for a while now actually
so you'll be able to play around with
the other things like aperture and
exposure that means silky looking
waterfalls and star tracking I loved
this feature on the 7x and that manual
control over the aperture can be set
anywhere from F zero point nine five to
f/16 which is pretty impressive so many
budget phones cut corners when it comes
to the camera but that is clearly not
the case here now of course is where the
ball pit fitted into the equation
providing the perfect opportunity for us
to tweet pictures and hashtag be our
selfies fun but very dangerous do not to
lose your keys in one of those things
overall this is potentially a very
affordable device for content creators
and Instagram lovers especially with
real-time headset monitoring also thrown
in for good measure for anyone there who
wants a phone that looks premium at a
more affordable price this will be a
strong contender at 199 pounds here in
the UK this is perhaps the most
affordable way to get on that portrait
mode bandwagon there's no word yet on
whether it's just coming to the US or
how much it'll cost if it does refer us
Brits it will be available on Friday and
