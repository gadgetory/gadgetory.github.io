the first google+ hangout show about
android stuff I am Scott Anderson and
this is dan Carlton Darcy I do use your
left hand it's a lack of a lot cuvee i
always put through that that's all right
Johnathan Franklin how you guys go today
good nice to be here good stuff good day
okay so damn what we got on the docket
for tonight so we got some app updates
tonight we also have a contest for in
nexus for an international giveaway
Darcy's going to talk a bit more about
that later on how to win we've got some
big news in patent wars as well as new
carrier news as always some advice news
and device updates as well as a little
bit of written and ramen noodles cool
cool well to start out with a pup dates
we got a titanium backup that got
updated basically the big feature and a
feature that people have been waiting
for is you can create a flashable zip of
selected apps and their data um this is
really nice so you don't have to make a
nandroid and have to flash it all over
and have to get the data and everything
I mean it'll save a lot of time oh
absolutely i mean this is this is
something that it should have had that
ages ago I mean it's yeah it's wrong
card of software features for a backup
application yeah I mean yeah it's
difficult and it's mean it's Curtis them
for being able to implement it but it's
certainly something that I think people
have wanted for a very long time it's
especially for people that flash roms
all the time it's a huge time saver yeah
also they added the functionality of
having the ability to upload to dropbox
files that are bigger than 150 megabytes
so that's nice as well to get your app
updates and all of your backups in the
cloud and not being limited by how big
the file sizes is really nice next app
update is Google Shopper basically it
has a brand new UI it kind of reminds me
of Google Plus on a tablet with their
tile features
it's a nice nice UI it's mostly picture
oriented so if you think Google Plus
pictures and also you have some ratings
from google guide it's basically more
streamlined app and interesting and you
also get some notifications that are
built into and then app a rumor
microsoft office for android and iOS is
rumored for may 2013 release i like the
fact that they're coming to android what
do you guys think about this do you
think this is going to be an app that's
going to be used widely or is it
something that too little too late i
think it's definitely going to be used
widely i mean i think there's a lot of
people that are are very locked into
microsoft especially microsoft office in
a way where you make sure they're there
are bunches of apps that you can use to
work with office documents on android
and iOS right now but there's a lot of
people that just are very locked into
the I need Microsoft in order to work
with this right it's the leftover relic
of the 90s where you had to have
microsoft office to work with the
microsoft office document words you know
no it is you can work with it with libre
office or you know I work or Google Docs
or zoho or any number of others but
people still think I need office it
needs to come from Microsoft for it to
work and especially in enterprise I
think that this help android in
particular get its foot learning to the
door of a global enterprise in a way
that you know I t in enterprise we're
willing to accept when it's back with
the same microsoft security and software
assurance and integration with all the
other services um they're trying to
legacy support base region central yeah
and they're tying it very heavily into
their office 365 and their SkyDrive
platform which makes sense because the
you know the standalone office 2013 for
for desktop is time very heavily in
SkyDrive as well so trying to unify that
across across everything this is this is
Microsoft's new big thing is pushing for
unified everything across mobile and
desktop and make it all the same oh um
it's a bit limited though because it
doesn't have editing ability unless you
also have a 365 subscription
though with the new sort of subscription
model for office 2013 I'm sure that'll
become less of a problem um for a lot of
people though that don't have 365 or
kind of turned off by the subscribing to
desktop client software uh I think that
they're going to go past this and get a
little turned off by the fact they can't
actually yeah I think Google really has
a big opportunity here to actually you
know keep innovating in Google Docs and
all of their online suites of tools that
people use every day and offered for
free and I think it'll be interesting to
see what how Google respond to this and
there's been so many competitors that
have come into this market segment but
yeah yeah I'm excited a little bit of
foresight buying a quick office as far
as a fan thing that realize how
important mobile office features I'm
going to be in the future so yeah yeah
the Microsoft is obviously that the
player in office suites I mean there
there are other players but when it
comes to especially to business
microsoft office is it it is the
beginning in the end so I don't
recognize even if it does the exact same
thing is another client right right
right after yeah even if there are
competitors people always go to office
first so I think it'll definitely get a
lot of use how good it's going to be I
think remains to be seen okay so let's
move on to some Google Wallet goody
myths the Google Wallet physical card
that is confirmed to work on the support
page it was confirmed that non NFC app
compatibility will work with 2.3
Gingerbread Plus which is exciting and I
like the legacy roots support here yeah
it's also a way for them to get google
wallet into sort of consumer use without
having to deal with all the carrier and
I've see blocking it bullcrap right so
if unit verizon or tmobile or AT&amp;amp;T says
though you can't use google wallets and
of c ab you'd still be able to get the
non out of c version the molecular very
least control the physical card control
your
the new mobile wallet stuff and you know
pick which card is LinkedIn is the
primary car and all check out your
balances do all the management and stuff
like that and you know get around the
carrier blocks mmm those you want that
are wondering where Derek is derrick is
in Mountain View and he is at Google for
a google TV ambassador meeting so he's
having fun there and just want to give
you as an update of where he is okay
let's move on to a Verizon Verizon is
completely closing their V CAST app
store thank goodness yep unless thing is
about 19 other bloatware apps to go and
they were in the clear so yeah ballston
to take a lot yeah especially like the
easy navigator come on but yeah but I
mean with a monthly subscription of like
8 to 16 bucks they're probably
definitely making bank on it so oh yeah
only how much it cost them up yeah
that's a good point I wonder how the API
that they tap into to get this
navigation to probably google maps yes
all yes I mean small steps for verizon
any progress from them i think is good
for consumers but we have one less and
we just added the amazon suite of
applications to most verizon devices so
it's one one step forward and by the
lives back without yeah so some rumors
suggest that google maps for iOS may get
blocked by Apple interesting and lightly
built the longer that Google goes with
it not being on iOS the better for
google hmm yes and no mean people not
using their services not a good thing
but to sort of built up anticipation is
is sort of the same thing Apple was
raving about with verizon before it had
the iphone right like once we bring the
iphone to verizon everybody's going to
love it and everybody's gonna rush out
by it so once i'm
like get it there it's going to be huge
but I'm looking at it like if you're on
iOS and you don't have something like
Google Maps that is a deterrent for iOS
making people deep you know deflect to
Android yeah so and that's the way I'm
looking at it yes they lose the searches
initially but the thing is they may make
up for it when they have a huger you
know market share and ultimately more
reliable and trustworthy customers yeah
I mean part of the problem here is just
apples apples strange approval process
and they're very hitter attitude towards
Google I mean I get that the two are
fighting each other all over the place
but when it comes to app approvals they
really really target at Google in a very
specific way I mean we saw the the
updated voice search app just came out
I'm shocked it even made it through like
that but it took a long harlot yeah
google I talked about it months in
advance it was just sitting in Apple's
approval q now there's some rumors that
suggests that the recently let go apple
senior vice president was head of iOS
with the sticking point on that and it
was the day that he was let go that it
finally went into the App Store so there
might be some truth to that but what is
this isn't new behavior from a low right
they did the same thing with google
voice their big thing is oh well it's
conflicting with built-in functionality
it's not even just Google um a recent
Google purchase sparrow email the
popular iOS email client is going to get
blocked in iOS version 5 because they
bring in some feature I think it's true
type text that's new to iOS 6 and they
basically trick it to work on iOS 5 but
that breaks apples terms of service how
dare you build an application that does
something better than what Apple can
yeah and so it's just not good for
consumers this is really the bottom line
and it's unfortunate they've blocked
third party developers and used their
ideas on the turned it around on going
base filed patents for it yeah without
acquiring the company
but without my exact file patents for
someone else's idea that they blocked
from the store it's sad I'm a flip side
you got a google that acquires and
implements but you know forgets that I
feel better argument for another great
artists do all right okay let's go move
on to Dan's favorite section we got some
patent wars information yes of society
the big development in the the motorolla
cases so both Apple and Microsoft have
been suing motorola um this these cases
are a little bit different from the
Samsung ones these aren't actually about
infringement these are specifically
about licensing basically both Apple and
Motorola or excuse me I'm Microsoft her
accusing Motorola of violating their
fair reasonable and non-discriminatory
obligations on patent licensing saying
that they're demanding unreasonable
licensing fees well they're demanding
tuna quarter percent which shakes out to
about six dollars a device for
perspective apple says that their
standards essential patents are worth
thirty to forty dollars per device
though their argument already seems a
little weak um but the the case against
Motorola from apples specifically get
tossed out with prejudice and for pretty
much the same reasons that the last
Apple Motorola case got tossed out by
Judge Posner basically the judge ruled
that among other things there's there's
no win here no matter what the outcome
of any kind of licensing trial is nobody
actually gets any kind of remedy right
like if you want to file a lawsuit in
America there has to be a problem and
filing a lawsuit has to be able to lead
to some solution if there's no actual
solution it you can't file a lawsuit
it's pretty much what the ruling says
there are a lot of other problems with
it too like Apple pretty much saying
well you know we're submitting to this
this case to set a fair reasonable and
non-discriminatory rate but if we don't
like what that rate is we're just going
to ignore it so the judge was a little
bit pissed off that Apple is basically
saying we want you to waste all of your
time to give us a advisory opinion well
yet the courts not really there to give
you an advisory opinion they're there to
give you a legally binding it again
that's what the court does
so yeah the the judges were pretty
pissed at Apple and threw it out pretty
pretty strongly um epple really really
trying to get back and do it by making a
lot of compromises and if you even still
just didn't get anywhere with it uh
meanwhile on that front the motorola
case from microsoft is still proceeding
this one's in seattle so microsoft's
home turf and the judge is i'd say more
than a little bit biased mmm this this
judge has ordered the two parties to
ignore the findings of other judges from
other nations and to not in not
implement those other judges you know
court orders because apparently this
district court judge in seattle thinks
that they had jurisdiction over the
Mannheim court in germany I don't really
know where they think they get that
authority they definitely don't have it
legally but here we are with you know
judge in Microsoft's backyard ruling
left and right for Microsoft so this
case is not getting thrown out um it is
getting shrouded a lot of secrecy on
google seems to be taking a lot of flak
for that the press but really it's a lot
of joint motions to suppress we're both
Motorola and Microsoft are signing off
together and going to the judge and
saying what all of these filings
redacted so it's not you know one side
trying to hide anything both sides
you're trying to hide everything which
is pretty standard especially for a
licensing trial right this isn't about
infringing this is about how do we
determine how you know how we value our
standards essential patents and so
that's a lot of really you know really
internal negotiations negotiations with
a vast amount of other unrelated
companies so there really is a lot of
confidential and proprietary information
um in other patent news Apple is going
to have to pay 368 million dollars to
what amounts to basically a patent troll
a company called vernet X for
infringement of facetime protocols
basically they have patents over a
technology that more or less establishes
a VPN in advance and oliver video
connection
uh they've been running around suing
Microsoft I think they got 100 million
from Microsoft they're also going after
cisco systems and a bunch of other
big-name video conference and type
software's so they've been they've been
winning everywhere they're filing so
they definitely of strong claims and
during the case Apple pretty much made
the argument that well this is such a
small feature of the phone that this
infringement really shouldn't matter
meanwhile rounded corners should be
worth thirty to forty dollars of device
all mall a round on are extremely
innovative and their guests what's been
out there yeah so apples pretty much
been been losing pretty rehabbing the
patents they even had to have their
senior vice president Phil Schiller go
back in for more questioning after the
first Samsung trial this for the problem
is things that he said under oath in the
first trial are not quite matching up
with things that he said in sworn
affidavits that for the second Samsung
trial so there there are definitely some
questions there and it's highly unusual
for witness to be called back in for a
case especially after the verdict is
already come back on that case um so I
mean they aren't saying it's perjury
outright and they're never going to have
enough like actual evidence to do that
but there's definitely substantial
suspicion over to the validity of his
testimony the spouts speaking of losing
duh you guys checked out Apple stock
lately oh yeah yeah in the last month i
think it's dropped at least a hundred
points yeah yes like twenty percent down
from its peak yo yeah that's like a
hundred billion dollars of value get
lost yeah and yet people this brokers
and other people are still quoting it as
a potential nine hundred dollar stock
which 11 line develops document yeah i
mean it's ridiculous the most famous one
is that Brian White from tobeco capital
apparently needs like vemos zeroed in on
Apple's business the supply line and
everything and he says now it's never
been a better time to buy yeah it is
true keep right now my BS but I mean so
could Google I mean you could look at
Google 20 years from now that could be
three thousand dollars so oh yeah I mean
I've seen lots places that are saying
Google's worth a thousand dollars
Microsoft's worth 500 it's at 30 right
now so that's a huge difference in
higher exactly right the market is a
finicky thing but I mean everyone has
such high expectations towards Apple
that even a slight misstep with Foxconn
not being able to produce enough iphone
so they don't produce an extra 5 million
iphones for the quarter that's coming on
a slant present to get beaten up in the
market yeah slake my steps like selling
5 million iphones in the opening weekend
your house is your stock to tumble and
having raining sales is it as well yeah
and having ipad mini sales that are not
in a little bit lackluster boom you mean
I've had many sales that are so
lackluster that they don't even actually
mention them they just lump them
together with the sales the ipad 4 I
didn't I did it with all of their same
type devices oh yeah they did okay so
like all iphone sales belong together
pretty much yeah yeah okay no no usually
on launch weekends they'll say we sold
this many of the brand new one this week
yeah but you know on earnings calls and
stuff they're not going to say anything
they're saying iphones this is how many
we saw riven right but no for the for
the opening weekend announcement it was
just iPad so long together which is a
little unusual travel ok they doing on
earnings Kosta yeah yeah let's move on
to some carrier news oh we got some big
carrier news sprint buys 480 million
dollars of us sell your cellular and
then do they do this for customers only
did they do it for a spectral probably a
little bit of both um they're picking
about a little shy of six hundred
thousand five hundred eighty-five
thousand customers which that's a lot of
people but sprint has many things like
40 million customers it's not really a
big difference when you're talking about
companies that size um really what the
picking up is 20 megahertz of PCs
spectrum across midwest we got illinois
indiana chicago area st. louis area so
it's just the whole Middle swath of the
country there and this is where they are
currently deploying LTE on their plan is
to use it for LTE the 20 megahertz block
of it means that they're going to be
able to build out their LTE
substantially more than
what they're giving right now no other
building it on a five by five blocks and
so it's you know for anybody has sprint
LTE you know it's a lot slower than
verizon or AT&amp;amp;T reason for that it's not
a five by five connection instead of 10
my tab now these blocks of spectrum how
big is 20 makers I mean it is at a
substantial piece of spectrum can they
do a lot of damage and offer a lot
better service with this spectrum yeah
yeah the smell out them to put 10 by 10
ltd in these markets okay that's that's
a huge difference versus the five by
five that they were looking at before um
usually you'll see blocks of sort of ten
at a time going so they're getting two
chunks of that and a black of 10
megahertz across a market is enough to
cover that market at least minimally so
20 mega 20 megahertz of spectrum in that
band is a is a big chunk so they're
gonna be able to put LTE there which is
definitely good for customers in those
regions once I can get it up and running
okay and on tmobile turns on iphone
friendly hspa+ on pcs e baltimore and
houston yeah so this is the 1900
megahertz the pcs band which t-mobile
has always had service on they've just
had edge coverage which is why the
iPhone that doesn't have t-mobile's AWS
where their hspa+ has been in the past
it's why the iPhone only gets edge data
is very slow 2g data t-mobile is there
their brief framing their 1900 megahertz
their pcs deployment and moving a lot of
the edge up to hspa+ and this is the
same hspa+ that they already have the
same 42 megabit so a lot faster than
ITT's so people have been checking out
the speeds with their iphones in those
areas and they're getting two to three
times but you can get on a tts so
definitely a huge improvement for for
t-mobile's 1 million iphone users um
just three markets for starters but it's
going to be a lot easier for them to do
this rollout than it is to do the LTE
rollout that a lot of other dumplings
you're doing because the reason less
expensive yeah the difference between
the the you know the edge g-pen GPRS or
GPRS
GM or UMTS tax just not that much
different from HS no it's a very glenn
HS your existential yeah where's the
jump from that to LTE requires a whole
new set of technology lay ahead okay
Allison moving on to AT&amp;amp;T I mean AT&amp;amp;T is
trying to join the big boys with their
LTE rollout they're investing 14 billion
dollars into network build out now
that's not over there just their
wireless but a roll out that is actually
their wireless and their wireline yeah I
have a back haul you know so they're
doing a lot of fibre rollout for
businesses and wireless they're doing a
lot of the LTE investment that they
should have been doing before but
they're you know they have the hspa+ to
fall back on which is good it's a better
fall back than cdma or three yeah it's
better than what yeah it's doesn't
better than cdma yeah so um it's a huge
investment that I think the and their
plan to have LTE for 300 million by 2014
I think that they'll hit that towards
the end of 2014 yeah but they're like a
year behind um when it comes to LTE
rollout I mean yeah yeah they're it's I
think it's seventy seven or eight
markets right now and verizon said
something like 400 yeah it's ridiculous
verizon I think covers runner-up 215
million people right now he's not going
to be to that point until like the end
of 2013 so because i tend to use
revision ators of revision nine i think
its nine and t-mobile's is actually edit
at so that does kind of give AT&amp;amp;T a
little bit of an advantage over verizon
for not having to go back upgrade as
much think that but really the only
difference in revision nine verses eight
is the addition of support for the bass
that ate that ATT is used otherwise it's
the same tech yeah
Tim Tims computers Terry yeah okay and
uh also eat EMTs offering like a hundred
dollars off for tablets on contracts so
they're trying as much as they can to
get people on their network and it's a
more parent in even more than before and
also 18t was fined seven thousand
dollars for overcharging customers and
that was kind of interesting yeah yeah
individual customers are going to get
twenty or thirty dollars off on a future
bill it has to do with some like weird
snafu that they had where they were
randomly moving people from one plan to
another without telling them this is
yeah seven hundred thousand dollars is
really very much a slap on the wrist for
a company like a that's nothing that's
not a lot of money um but their else
this was a relatively small case it was
this relatively small group of people
that were affected by some clerical
problem they had and then we have
verizon to complete their LTE rollout by
mid-2013 and their coverage will be 300
million people currently around 250
right mm-hm and so I mean more rural
areas will get it and I mean all the
main places have it now um Derek doesn't
have it thank goodness um yeah and he'll
tell you about it ah oh yeah yeah people
um but this is big 2030 mmm um it's
ahead of projection oh yeah oh yeah
they've thrown a lot of money down yes
they are yeah they're about six months
ahead of schedule when they stay
complete they mean basically their LTE
footprint will match they're cdma
footprint so if it once once that
happens is really when we'll start to
see the real transition LTE it's right
now everything real realistically still
works on cdma and gsm and that LTE is
kind of a bolt-on extra and there's some
inherent problems with that once we
progress the point where things are on
LTE and then cdma or gsm is the bolt on
back mm-hmm as opposed to the other way
around we'll see devices sort of strict
to develop in a lot more interesting
ways you know metropcs is probably gonna
be the first carrier that actually goes
that way they're planning to shut down
their cdma network by the end of 2013
regardless of the t-mobile buyout um for
this is verizon saying that they're
going to complete their LTE network
doesn't mean that they're going to touch
their CVMA they won't even think about
starting to roll this down for four
probably three to five years after that
because they have to make sure that they
get every single person on their network
off of a cdma only advice on to an LTE
device then once they get everybody
using you know dual-mode LTE ctmas then
they can start dialing that back and
they have to wait until they get ever
going on to LTE only devices before they
ever start shutting it off though so
that's the best case there's just two
hope you're able to get voice over LTE
across the country yeah and I mean
Express bleed off all the legacy devices
all together and hope people upgrade so
yeah and and and I know we've talked
about this in previous episodes but the
let's say they get their full rollout by
mid-2013 and they want to take their LTE
to the next level how easy is it for
them to upgrade their existing towers is
it very you know it is it cost-effective
is it is it cheap is it hardware is it
software you know I don't know enough
about verizon's network architecture to
a really detailed answer in lab um it
can be set up in a way that it's
relatively easy where you just make some
software changes and maybe potentially a
couple of minimal hardware changes and
then flip a switch it can be it can be a
lot harder we have to flavor place
everything which tends to me that you
don't actually replace it you bring up
the new thing alongside get to transfer
everything very slowly from one to the
other do a lot of testing on it and
fries and lots to do lots and lots and
lots of tests on testing yes that you
finally start to decommission the old
line so for for example the move from
ltd to lte-advanced could be a lot more
problematic for some carriers okay and
then the shoulder moved lte-advanced
might be problematic how about the move
to voice over LTE will that be a simple
switch um that has to do with the spec
Jonathan I mention this earlier LT a
spec 9 vs 10 versus the different
specifications of an LTE is very much to
like developing technology it's not as
as firmly standardized as gsm there's
something like 17 different revisions of
LTE and voice over LTE doesn't come into
it until some of the later ones so for
verizon for example they don't have
voice over LTE at all implementing it
and theory should be relatively simple
and should be mostly software side but I
mean we've seen verizon stroll with a
lot of their network in plantations and
they're still having a lot of problems
with the LTE to cdma handoffs so giving
voice over LTE to hand off to see the MA
was only done for the first time and
demonstration just at last year's CES by
qualcomm it still isn't really widely
used on metro pcs has voice over LTE but
they I don't think they actually do a
cdma hand off of that a poner right like
if you're on a voice over LTE connection
you drop your L to eat you drop your
call ok i would so move on to from
carrie renewals move on to some devices
jonathan yet some information for us
yeah first on the table is the HTC droid
DNA which if you've been following this
particular device it's been previously
rumored to be the DLX like the deluxe or
the droid incredible x of the dicks so
whichever one you were hoping it was
going to be the droid DNA appears to be
your final name there's a November 13th
event that is a joint event between HTC
and Verizon in new york city that will
announce this device that's this is the
nexus devices right same day that the
nexus 10 and the others will being
released and it has gotten FCC approval
for verizon cdma and lt so this device
is coming now is this going to be HTC's
i'm coming let's face the facts HTC has
been torn apart as a company they are
losing lot
me you know a lot of money it is this
going to be a device that people are
going to swap up I mean on paper good
very wealthy it's got its got it
operates let's hope they market it well
but you know they're they're beating
Samsung and others to a 1080p screen to
a quad-core processor on a newer
architecture than what's there they're
beating them to a lot of different
hardware specifications and the battery
life is a little bit of a question mark
but it's got it where it counts though
display the display on the One X is
beautiful and it's this is going to be
you know a step up from that I mean I
don't know it's like a 440 pics ppi
pixel this so you're not gonna be able
to see that but this should be some
improvements I mean it's well beyond
what you're going to see with the naked
eye yeah it is the best panel on the
market right now for a mobile but a lot
of stuff that's not talked about with
regard to those panels toshiba ng Japan
display and they both demonstrated no
1080p displays of this caliber so
apparently though there's going to be
two revisions of the panel that's used
some tennis it felt itself is going to
come from Toshiba which is the one
that's going to be on the devices headed
towards the states and the other panel
is going to be destined for
international markets so there will be a
little bit of difference probably with
regards to brightness but either way I
mean they hit it out of a Part B on
second thought is I think at this point
with these type of display the pics on
this the only the biggest ? now it's
just the color balance it's getting that
right because you're not going to get
individual pixels on a 5-inch screen or
even a even a larger screen you get in
1080p resolution you're not going to see
the pixels you're going to see the color
balance and accuracy of that make it up
maybe you don't mention the data you
don't just for being able to fire to
actually fully take advantage of that is
just absolutely take advantage like an
ALICE it's the arguments are going to
come down to color balance and
visibility in daylight and viewing
angles and yeah that nature at this
point then than it is seeing individual
pixels anymore yeah likes to use their
retina branding for marketing purposes
and the
sort of the definition that is supposed
to be more pixels than what you can see
with the naked eye um realistically
there are 3 26 in the iphone in the
iphones anything about 260 it does not
mean for for most practical people yes
it is more than what you can distinguish
for somebody with perfect 2020 vision
you can distinguish pixels at that
density it has to be over about 350 to
actually get that far and we're talking
about something that's into the 400
range this is well beyond what the human
eye is Kate way distinguishing I
wouldn't think the real question is is
this device you know along with verizon
massive marketing push that setting up
is it gonna be enough to reverse HTC
fortunes on the other words kind of
rooting for HTC we know we want to come
need to succeed to produce great party
okay yeah I mean it certainly could be
they they built their brand on the back
of the droid incredible had the HTC even
the any Motorola no I let's not be good
i'm sure i think the back to that i've
heard with those two devices and built
up and then the desire series in trash
they mean they've got it they've got to
recapture that if they want to get back
on their feet verizon they really kind
of shot themselves in the foot with the
thunderbolt in the result and they were
bound to the Thunder ball gets a lot of
hate but realistically the Thunderbolt
wasn't the droid charge which is was a
disaster T worse it was much worse than
a thunderbolt you know now now the
Thunderbolts usable the charges just had
so many hardware issues and yeah in a
long streak of this horrible devices the
the x on it was probably the only you
know but that was Motorola's first shot
as Elton that was probably the only one
that didn't have major major it still
had signal issues but you know HTC got
better with the resound as far as
implementation and not your own 2nd gen
LT hardware these arguments are out the
window ya heard what the thunderbolt and
and there yeah the problem there was the
tech and like you said I mean verizon
just had this string of crappy devices
because the tech just wasn't there to
back him up in all the cross they were a
little fuzzy up to you HTC all of them
were just cracked devices just they were
pretty bad
and even the incredible 4G LTE is you
know verizon's cheap and down Verena
would have been a one ass it really just
should have been what a semi these
things aren't really helping HTC's
reputation but now Oh HTC really just
gets burned basically because there they
own pretty much every major u.s. care
did the first one to introduce a new
network technology they've just gotten
burned for they had the what the heavily
to attend imax the first LTE device on
EMTs the higher AT&amp;amp;T the first hspa+ 42
device on mobile I mean they work with
carriers closely but sometimes it just
becomes meant to get you you know the
fact that they innovate like that and
our first to the you know to the game I
think that's why people are rooting it
for them and the fact of the matter is
we want more competition so I mean I
hope that they pull out of it we don't
want to see a two horse race between
said oh yeah I mean we already are but
it's just standing so close able to see
some how to care should be taken up by
two players in the market yes let me
just tell me to see Linda Linda if we
look at the role of you know he has
three this time it represented like the
first time that you know internet for
pumping like Samsung was able to have a
pretty considered bullet on a global
basis and it was only a month you know
after the actual events in London at the
st that it went on sale international
and then a month later he looks on say
on the state's about a month depending
on the carrier that's helps your
marketing substantially because you can
pop online Sam something with the
Olympic Games and galaxy s3 whatever
carries your own Otranto get yourself a
little basis right yep yeah you don't
need that if rehydrate CN a stalker so
so speaking of Mexico so speaking of the
motorola razr HD is going to be Mexico's
first LTE smartphone via tell cells so
yeah not a bad device to start yourself
off with its mmm the razr HD wait around
with one and Verizon assalam
she really saw the phone well built has
a good feel in the hand and then just
lead over for customer south of the
border finally getting LTE yeah
definitely hungry sauna it's a good time
for them to get an LT so long as the
carrier holds up their end of it yeah
definitely it's definitely especially as
a lot of newer places are rolling out
LTE and Europe is kind of coming to the
day anyway again a lot of HS still just
now getting on over three months through
now yeah it's I mean there are a lot of
advantages to that because it's it's
more established now and so they kind of
know how to do it right learn for US
military saints yeah verizon I heard I
heard from some people that work with
Motorola out of Asia that they typically
don't really prioritize devices outside
of the United States we've always known
that you know motor oil has been very
much a North American focus um but
Google is making a big push you know to
expand their reach on an international
basis so I think we'll see a lot more
device off yourself and actually to know
the road soon there is land outside of
the United States ya know I realize it
more a lot more people live was def
assignable look a lot harder it focusing
on the international community in terms
of device purchasers and wireless
thumbing their noses at verizon and AT&amp;amp;T
and sprint as device purchasers it's so
much easier to hit an international push
to to hit so many young users because
i'm a technologist so i get the device
updates so much match they don't ya know
and they're they're targeting their
consumers to be consumers not yet
companies that then turn around and
resell to the consumers yeah ok so
speaking of germany oh yeah german
galaxy note 10.1 is going to be dealing
jellybean 4.1 all that rolling out now
is that rolling out that's one out now
growing up so just being is this jelly
bean is to be had on the more clearly
being goodness that stuff we see nice to
feed that market or go up of that bump
it up I don't get another half a
percentage point or so on that is a big
improvement over I CSI oh man
really is you know you know you don't
realize until they use a device on a
daily basis and they just kind of hit
hit you just how much yeah and in
addition to the notes s-pen I think it
also has the samsung picture in picture
mode so it doesn't especially in a
tablet i think that gets a lot more use
than aneya yeah okay modified the great
a multi window mode if they fix the
multi window mode issues that's worth
the upgrade in itself because the first
time you guys have used better the over
screen browser before i'll give you use
that real find that they actually have
an updated it to to jelly bean you know
and if you look at some some sort of pop
up play which they have you know in all
the places the reason once a week jelly
bean doesn't work with over screen you
know but they're for browsers living in
functionality you can't resize if you
can't do a lot of things with it so
Samsung basically just forward the idea
made it less functional and the
developers have enough data yet let's
give a little taste yeah yeah more to
come not exactly where we go multi
window it's inherently limited and you
can only using you know a small set of
circumstances person knows mambi HTC one
sv another one s variant is a coming off
Australia Singapore and maybe Europe as
ice itself is very similar to the one s
and kind of like almost closer between
a1 S and an incredible 4G yeah it
doesn't have the debt image sense super
camera processing stuff that the 1s and
the ex have which is pretty good pretty
soon why the HTC shots and then the
expert on the cameras and yeah it still
has the same camera sensor so the actual
like the quality films were the same it
just cannot do the fancy processing that
the others can be with them um and it's
also got the same down clocked one point
to hear its dual core Krait that the ink
for jihad as posts the 1.5 that's and
the others so definitely a mid-range
device um I think it's 4.3 inches and
qhd so definitely not yeah not anything
to write home about these days but yeah
is associated technology has come to the
point that we're saying this yeah yeah
definitely where this is honey you're
shining a device with a you know pretty
solid processor in a qhd screen and just
labeling it as just run-of-the-mill than
this I'd say we're in a much better
place and we're two years ago so okay
and then even when Erica yeah yeah M&amp;amp;S
is going to be available in ceramic
black for free t-mobile USA yes that's
the fancy international arc welded
ceramic were they like flesh well lit it
some ridiculous way basically strike it
with lightning to ceramicist this metal
so I a lot of us make someone and earth
to go to that trouble if they couldn't
just powder coat the metal yeah that's
it doesn't sound it's cool yeah it was
nice but you can look at school you can
hit powder coating with a hammer ooh not
even chip it but I guess how long too
much of a shock I fog out in the details
and brings me on to the fact that colors
and being carrier exclusive is pissing
me off the fact that some cash maroon
colors some carriers have black some
here garnet red ridiculous yeah it is
get a case make it whatever color you
want make a thin case because cases are
annoying yes but you want you to color
get case yeah the last little bit for
devices Motorola has added the electrify
m to their device unlocked program so if
you're on US cellular then you can get
an unlockable motorola device now yeah I
think that's basically a clone of the
razor ab just yes very slightly it's
honestly shocking because most of the
smaller carriers like that don't even
get phones they're that good so yeah a
lot of a lot of the smaller lot of the
smaller carriers are still getting new
phones with Gingerbread and two year old
hardware so yeah it's kind of that's
what they make their money they make a
ton on it yeah so I the first time good
tell us a little bit more about
nexus 4 giveaway right yeah absolutely
yeah so obviously uh thanks for checking
out the Hangout guys you know for
visiting android authority this is all
we do you live to serve you guys trying
to make the site as good as possible you
know make youtube or production our
device reviews the vs and really cover
everything about the android ecosystem
because we're really passionate about it
so with that in mind we always love to
get back and we're going to be giving
away nexus 4 for international audience
and so obviously for those of you guys
who have tuned in right now you've
probably been waiting for the secret
code anyway so the code for the hippos
extra point for this time around it's
going to be a a loves nexus 4 and so
that's a a lov es n e x us for just
remember to punch that in on the
rafflecopter little widget there and the
article and you will get those points no
gainers to know does capitalization
matter on that it doesn't matter though
okay so we're just going to go to join
so basically you'll just see at the top
of the sites go to android authority
calm and there will be a nexus for
international giveaway just there for
talk we've made the post acquisto no
matter what day or time you go you'll
see it there you just scroll down about
two thirds down the page and you'll see
the rafflecopter widget and from there
you can just enter the secret code and
you can't just like people that i gave
you and there we on our end will see
that you've entered the code correctly
and you'll get those extra points which
will increase your chances to win that
particular device nice so do you have to
do anything else like shared on social
media or followed you want Rihanna I
mean there's a lot of different chats
doing if you really really want it to do
it the best way you know your circle us
just subscribe to our YouTube pick up
liking Facebook unfortunately the news
you guys I don't like its I like that
you can comment you can plus the article
itself you can like the article and then
you can enter that boat and if you
listen for next week's hang out you will
have a different book for that and so
that will just give you the best chances
of winning which are still really good
right now only about 500 people have
entered the pontiff so you still have
actually compared to lotteries and stuff
like that you have move your resume logs
yeah especially you can get multiple
shots at past exactly yeah we also I
should mention our for our Indian
specific listeners
you also have an Indian version of
android authority which is just I end on
android authority calm when we cover
Android news android device releases and
all that other stuff related
specifically to Indian market where we
actually have another nexus point
giveaway there too you know we don't
want you guys to get infected so we have
a separate giveaway for you guys said to
you sir check out that site also
excellent sweet so again the code is AAA
loves nexus 4 that's right that is the
code okay loves nexus for that all right
so let's move on to rootin and ramen and
then with wrap up here so cyanogenmod
they built in a root root capable file
explorer yeah that's that's def I huge
fur for people that especially for
people they're doing testing I know
personally one of the biggest annoyances
I have is I flash gapps on something I'm
just putting it up to test and I can't
get access the file system because I
have to download a file browser I know
senator mud used to package a file
explorer that was kind of mediocre uh
this one definitely looks a lot nicer
plus it has built-in root capability
that's all integrated with the last rest
of their development options so you
don't need to get root explorer or solid
explorer beta or any other route capable
I'll explorers it's just built into the
realm right there for you which
realistically is how it should be it's
Italy it's nice but the fact of the
matter is that a solid explorer beta 2
it has a you know you you know root file
explorer that's fine that's great but it
also has dual windows that you can
initiate your cloud services and
literally copy and paste your files your
cloud into your device it is the easiest
way to view files and copy stuff and oh
it's great yes I like science and by the
signs it kinda has an obligation to know
people still don't really separate the
difference between AOSP and Google
proprietary applications and
they have somewhat of an obligation to
have a phone that could stand by itself
usage wise without having the Play Store
tied to it so right you have
applications like that it's pretty
useful that to have something that's
usable and you don't have to you know
you don't want to flash the software on
there just desperately have to track
down apks online or something to be able
to to get something that's fully
functional so I think their biggest kind
of like the Apollo music versus having
google play music you know they
accomplish the same functions but one of
them is open source and you don't have
to tie in technical services to use it
so right and then the jelly bean for not
to core app updater Dan well yes so some
different organizations or I guess
individuals and the latter community put
together basically a flashable zip with
all the core jelly bean 4.2 applications
um so it lets you flash the new
swipeable keyboard together with the new
pinch to zoom enable the total email the
video camera and gallery that's all
built in it I think there's a couple of
other tweaked applications and there as
well bundle them all up and flash them
together I've heard those issues with it
it's apparently still using an older
version of the new gmail that doesn't
updates for the icons and still has some
problems is actually associated with the
Play Store ah yeah because I'm running
the photosphere and the new keyboard
keyboard has been great and had no
problems with it but photosphere I
gallery crashes probably a couple times
a day yeah I've heard that the the
packaged app the the flash before it is
using some older versions of the
keyboard and smaller versions of the
camera in the gallery so it might not be
the latest and greatest fixed up once
but obviously this is all still moving
target is 4.2 is not even really out yet
when is Google going to release it well
there I mean the I don't know if the
device is go on sale or just go up for
pre-order on the 13th I guess we'll find
out in five days um but my guess would
be that the code will go up on
for the devices probably almost
simultaneously before and you know it
the latest usually the latest had been
is probably what two days later or so
yeah i think that i may just about it's
like two days after they were in
customers hands yeah okay well um so for
those of you guys watching you guys can
watch us on youtube you can subscribe to
us on youtube you can subscribe and
listen to us on soundcloud if you don't
want to deal with the video bandwidth or
if you just don't like looking at us I
understand dan sometimes i just cannot
look at him but a soundcloud also we
have an RSS feed were available on
podbean we are available on itunes also
stitcher radio and if you want to find
all the posts we do a post after every
show the day after we have all the
streaming content up the night of and
the next day we have the article if you
go to android authority calm and scroll
down to the bottom right there is a
section on the bottom called on here and
you can get all that good eNOS stuff and
figure out how to subscribe on there
well guys thank you for joining us
tonight and hopefully you guys enter
that code the AAA loves nexus 4 right
that's right that it I you guys have a
great night I thanks a lot take these
