Authority and a soos made quite the
splash a couple of years ago with the
zenfone 2 mostly because it offered some
rather impressive specs at an extremely
low price point but nowadays phones with
high in specs and good build quality at
an affordable price are a dime a dozen
so what does a Seuss's latest flagship
do differently to make it worth
considering this is the zenfone 3 deluxe
there's a lot better phone has to live
up to especially when it uses a word
like Deluxe in its name and in most
aspects the zenfone 3 deluxe does
deliver just like you would expect from
a flagship phone the build quality is
fantastic it's an all metal unibody
design that both looks and feels great
you have chamfered edges going around
the front and back a sloping curve back
and rounded corners and sides that all
combine to give this phone a very smooth
and comfortable feel in the hand it's
fairly thin at seven and a half
millimeters giving it a very sleek look
but the most impressive part about this
metal build is that it's completely
metal all the way around so no seams or
breaks you won't find any plastic
antenna lines that you typically would
on most phones made of metal Asus claims
that this is the first metal phone to be
able to achieve this and it doesn't seem
to in any way inhibit the phone's
ability to pick up a wireless signal it
makes you wonder why we haven't seen
this sooner especially from much larger
companies but hopefully this will be a
trend we see with other manufacturers
going forward like previous design phone
devices you'll notice a Seuss's
signature concentric circle patterns on
the top and bottom chin and along the
power and volume buttons which are both
located on the right side it does indeed
have a headphone jack which is up top
and on the bottom is the USB type-c port
and a single bottom firing speaker it
sounds fine and gets decently loud but
it's not going to compare to a phone
with stereo or front-facing speakers and
like all bottom firing speakers it's
very easy to cover up with your hands
when holding the phone in landscape on
the left side is the SIM card slot which
has dual SIM support or you can use the
secondary slot to expanding phone's
memory with a microSD card it uses
capacitive keys for all your Android
navigation needs but unlike the majority
of recent Android flagships that use
capacitive keys the home button here
doesn't
double as a fingerprint sensor instead
the fingerprint sensor is on the back
and it's got this odd rectangular
pillars shape and not a circle or square
that were typically used to seeing it's
very accurate and unlocks the phone
every single time but the speed at which
it unlocks doesn't feel quite as fast as
some other fingerprint sensors and I ran
into a couple instances where it took a
good two to three seconds from when I
put my finger on the sensor to the phone
waking up and unlocking I'm also not a
fan of the fact that it doesn't have any
haptic feedback or vibration so there's
no way to tell that you're actually
unlocking your phone when you're just
doing it blindly on the front you have a
large 5.7 inch Super AMOLED screen with
1080p resolution it's not going to stack
up to a quad HD screen in terms of
sharpness especially for VR since the
resolution is being stretched out on
such a large screen but it's perfectly
fine for everyday purposes and looks
really great for a 1080p AMOLED display
it's very colorful vibrant has excellent
viewing angles and great contrast with
the deep blacks that you'd actually get
from an AMOLED screen it's a perfect
size if you love playing a lot of games
watching YouTube or movies and it comes
with some handy features that are
starting to become more common like a
blue light filter and the ability to
tweak the colors of the display to how
you want the screen to look having fewer
pixels to push on the display also helps
out a lot with the phone's performance
but that doesn't necessarily mean that
it's ooh skimped out on any of the specs
it's got the Snapdragon 820 processor
that virtually every flagship shipped
with this year and it's got a massive 6
gigabytes of RAM it's very safe to say
that performance on these end phone 3
deluxe has not been an issue whatsoever
it's extremely quick with everyday tasks
like launching apps or web browsing has
excellent touch response and it's no
surprise that this phone is very capable
of multitasking with a ton of apps open
in the background including a couple of
games without ever showing any signs of
slowing down despite a soos is very
heavy skin on top of Android it still
manages to provide a very fluid
experience a soos is Nui sits on top of
Android marshmallow and while a lot of
companies have gone the way of trimming
down and streamlining their user
interfaces a soos has gone in the
opposite direction the Zen UI changes a
lot of the Android experience and comes
jam-packed with a ton of features some
of which
you may or may not find to be all that
useful and if you prefer a more
simplistic experience this can feel a
little overwhelming some of the elements
also feel slightly outdated like the app
drawer for example still houses all the
widgets which we haven't seen on stock
Android since the Ice Cream Sandwich /
jellybean days the out-of-the-box
experience is very animation heavy and
while they do look pretty and flashy
some of the animations are quite long
and can make something as simple as
opening an app from a folder take more
time to do you do have the option to
change some of these animations like a
home screen scroll effects and folder
animations to something more standard
and shorter but you stick with these
longer animations it will make the
experience feel a lot slower the Zen UI
is very reminiscent of samsung's
touchwiz from a few years back
it's very bright colorful has a lot of
very cartoonish looking icons and comes
pre-installed with a handful of Asuza
zone bloatware applications although the
experience can feel in cohesive and
bloaty it certainly isn't all bad there
are some features that are useful such
as double tap to wake and sleep a
one-handed operation mode and an
integrated theme store that has a fairly
good selection of themes to let you
change the look and feel of the OS
inside it's got a decently sized 3000
milliamp hour battery with support for
quick charge 3.0 and battery life in my
experience has left a lot to be desired
it can most likely last a full day if
you're a lighter more casual user but if
you're someone like me who likes a game
and watch YouTube for several hours a
day on their phone don't expect it to
last all day gaming can drain any
phone's battery rather quickly but I
noticed that gaming on the zenfone 3
deluxe drains the battery significantly
faster than many other phones that I've
tested and used on a daily basis like
the s7 edge 1 + 3 T and Google's pixel I
always found myself charging it at least
once during the middle of the day and
the phone would typically only last
eight to nine hours off the charger
before having to be plugged back in
which is a good three to four hours I of
what I would normally expect in order to
get a full day's worth of use with the
camera you're looking at a 23 megapixel
camera on the rear with f 2.0 aperture
optical image stabilization and laser
autofocus on the front you have an 8
megapixel shooter also AF 2.0 and if
you're entertaining selfies it works
pretty well for that and it has a bunch
of beautifying settings that can hide
glum
is change your skin tone widen your eyes
or thin out your face to help you take
better selfies just like the Zen UI
itself the camera app is packed with a
ton of features and comes with 20
different shooting modes such as
beautification low-light a depth of
field mode time-lapse etc so there is a
lot you can do here with this camera the
built in manual mode is surprisingly
very well fleshed out
you've got the typical controls for
white balance exposure ISO shutter speed
and focus but it also features a
built-in histogram and a horizon leveler
so you can get a perfectly straight shot
every time with 23 megapixels you might
expect these photos to be very well
detailed but that just hasn't been the
case it's got good color reproduction
and pretty good dynamic range but the
images lack a lot of detail and
sharpness even in daylight shots they
look fine if you're looking at them as a
whole but once you zoom in you can
really see the photos starting to break
down and everything just appears rather
soft in well-lit situations the shutter
is nice and fast but once you're in
low-light it slows down drastically the
image quality really starts to fall
apart and despite having optical image
stabilization it doesn't seem to help
out a whole lot here there's a lot of
noticeable noise and blooming in the
highlights and again the overall image
is just soft and lacking any sort of
detail or sharpness it takes a good 2 to
3 seconds for the cam to capture a shot
in low-light and because of how long it
takes it became really difficult to get
a shot that was in focus there were
several instances where I took a photo
brought the camera down to look at it in
the gallery thinking that the camera was
done taking the shot only to wind up
with a completely blurry photo simply
because the camera was still in the
middle of trying to capture it it's a
great camera in terms of all the
features and shooting modes that it
offers but the actual experience of
using the camera is a little
underwhelming to say the least the
zenfone 3 deluxe will run you five
hundred dollars should you decide to
pick one up which isn't a bad price tag
but there certainly are several other
smartphones out there like the axon 7
and the new one plus 3t that undercut
this price and offer very similar
experiences it's got a beautiful metal
design a great looking display and comes
with a ton of features but so do a lot
of other smart phones and the zenfone 3
deluxe just fall short into many key
areas to really make it stand out as
always thank you guys so much for
