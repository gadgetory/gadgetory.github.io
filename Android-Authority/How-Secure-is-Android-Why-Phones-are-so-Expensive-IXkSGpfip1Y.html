Jace and this is where we try and answer
your most pressing Android questions now
the first question isn't very pressing
but surprisingly enough I got it more
than half a dozen times why do you have
the first Galaxy Note if you're so deaky
and up with tech wouldn't you have
upgraded by now are you challenging my
geek cred are you questioning my level
of decrease oh here we don't game let me
tell you something anyone can take a
Galaxy Note 3 and look slick and sexy
but the fact that I can take this old
clunky slow heifer of a phone and make
it do my bidding is a testament to my
level of degree what are you calling her
and if she decides to misbehave and be
slow crash or misplace my widgets again
you really don't want to do that I keep
her a line with a hard reboot yeah what
do you think now Google now chase we're
still listening oh you're good you're
good so to start off let's talk about
just how secure is Android Dante asks
hey Jase one question for you just how
secure is Android at a major conference
the former CEO of Google Eric Schmidt
claimed that Android was more secure
than the iPhone the audience's response
they laughed a lot now although that
wasn't the response that Eric Schmidt
was looking for it does testify to the
fact that there's a general consensus
false though it may be that Android is
somehow less secure than other mobile
operating systems so where does it all
come from and is it true in general the
Linux kernel for Android and the Darwin
kernel for iOS are equally vulnerable to
bugs which when exploited allow hackers
to gain unauthorized access to parts of
the system that should be off-limits
while linux and darwin are very mature
systems and all of the obvious bugs
should have been found both systems are
always changing and growing they are
dynamic and as such they will always be
security vulnerabilities so the bottom
line is that Android is not any more or
less secure than the iPhone there are
multiple layers of security built into
the OS and if you're not engaging in
high-risk
angers and restricting your apps to the
Google Play Store you should be able
enjoy your Android phone with no problem
chai asks I have to Google accounts for
some reason can I merge the two accounts
into one
yes chai you can and I watched a number
of videos on the subject that were far
too complicated but I found one right
here you can see that link or you can
click on the link that I have in the
show links that's very straightforward
and will set you straight
good luck and Tana sconul asks Jase why
are our phones a lot more expensive than
tablets most phones are about 600 to 800
dollars why are tablets only 2 to 300
dollars that's a great question Anton
I've had that question myself and I
found an answer to that that Asus gave
to CNET here it is with small devices
Asus regional director Jonathan sound
table said often there's more
engineering development and testing
required to shrink down the components
without affecting the heating for
example and still offering the best
performance I also think the development
and tooling costs are slightly higher
and you know what Asus regional director
I don't fully buy it I don't doubt that
it is a contributing factor but when you
take manufacturing and the economies of
scale I think that has much less of an
effect than the other two aspects that
to me are pretty obvious one is supply
and demand there is much more demand for
smart phones nowadays than there are
tablets and the second is just simply
perception if a tablet is regularly
eight nine hundred dollars people going
to be wondering why would I spend $800
for only a little bit of increased
mobility when I could get a notebook or
a small tablet that's much more powerful
for the same price or cheaper so it
really comes down to supply and demand
and perception good question them thanks
