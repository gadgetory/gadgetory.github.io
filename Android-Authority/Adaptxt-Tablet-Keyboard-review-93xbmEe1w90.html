this is clayton coming at you once again
from the best android site on the web
android authority calm today we've got a
complete overview of the adapt x
keyboard now this is the beta version
for tablets and they've gone through
redesigned the entire UI added some new
features and giving it some spice and
we'll check it out right now so we've
got it installed after you go through
the initial installation going to have
to select an add-on pack that's what
this little icon is made on installation
is done and the cool thing about the
add-ons is that they are industry
specific so you have your medical
industry your I team you've got business
and you can just choose any one of them
I'll go through the settings right there
and show you in a minute anyways this is
the user interface just like this you
have a few different options but I've
chosen this one for the sake of the
video anyways we can access our settings
just by clicking the quick settings
that's where we can go to our languages
our layouts our suggestion control and
then our full settings so let us go to
our full settings really quick here we
have our personalized suggestions where
adapt ex can learn from social networks
messages or contacts we could import
them from the phone book facebook
android dictionary well we can learn
from anything we can also learn from
Twitter um we can go to the my
dictionary where you can see the words
that is stored that it's learned from
your typing next we've got our add-on
manager now this is where all of our
different add-ons are located as you can
see we have our industry specific we
have our business us we've got business
UK we have IT industry medical industry
English Spanish a bunch of different
languages just endless possibilities
with the adapt X keyboard anyways we can
go to our layouts manager here where we
have the option of the full keyboard or
the split keyboard which I love the
split and then for the landscape mode we
also have the options of full or split
now we also have our handwriting
interface which I'll show you here in a
minute and demo okay next we have our
ATR which is the automatic text
replacement what's really cool about
that is that automatic text replacement
you can type in three letters and when
you typed it in on the keyboard and like
span to a forward let's get into the
inner workings of this keyboard and demo
it for a second so starting off we can
just type a sentence a you can see our
prediction is a kind of coming up with
some stuff we could put in for the Sen
after we put a team we can actually
choose sentence we can choose whether or
not this is located on the top or the
bottom of the keyboard through our
settings through the quick settings on
the suggestion control all demo below
the keyboard that's kind of nice so now
we'll just demo our little ham writing
utility here we can just write our
initials got that is this experimental
so it's still learning after we actually
type something we can also share to a
network just by holding this we can
share to Facebook or any other account
to have synced up to the adapt X beta
going into here is our different numbers
and punctuation we have two pages of
such and then we have our voice control
if we tap and hold and we have our voice
android authority is the best website
ever and it got it dead-on so anyways we
can also choose navigation where we can
just use our arrows and whatnot so this
is a great keyboard you've got your
split layout you've got handwriting you
can post your social networks automatic
text replacement it learns what you're
typing text prediction and not to
mention you have almost a hundred
different languages you can put in
including industry specific languages so
this is just a really great keyboard
they've done an awesome job I think just
checking this out you guys we've got a
tablet will be available on the market
to date so stay tuned guys you'll be
updated on Android more than you can
