authority and we're taking a quick look
at Samsung's newly announced Galaxy S 9
plus and comparing it to the Google
pixel to excel so obviously the first
thing you're going to notice is the
design between these two phones are very
different the Galaxy S 9 plus is design
pretty much retains the same form factor
from last year's model it's made mostly
out of glass with a lot of curves and
rounded corners and it has a really
sleek and slender look to it the pixel
to excel is much more industrial with
its metal body and has a flatter and
squared off design so it isn't quite as
elegant looking as the s9 plus but
they're very attractive looking phones
in their own ways both of them have tall
18 by 9 AMOLED screens but the bezels on
the s9 plus are much smaller and Samsung
says they're even thinner than last
year's s8 plus so you're getting a
slightly smaller phone but you're still
getting the same 6.2 inch screen the
other major Hardware difference with the
s9 plus is the fingerprint sensor has
been repositioned since that was one of
the biggest complaints with last year's
s8 it's now centered on the back similar
to the pixel 2 XL and it's much easier
and comfortable to use without smudging
up the camera
there's no headphone jack on the pixel 2
XL whereas there is a headphone jack on
the S 9 plus and Samsung has implemented
a second speaker into the earpiece to
complement the bottom firing speaker it
most likely won't be quite as good as
the two front facing speakers of the
pixel 2 XL but it's still nice to
finally have stereo sound on a Samsung
phone samsung also added dual cameras to
the Plus model this year you have two 12
megapixel cameras with a mechanical
aperture which means it's hardware based
and this lets you switch between an
aperture of f 24.70 or you can change it
manually within the pro mode the
secondary lens allows for background
blurring effects and the ability to
optically zoom into subjects without
losing detail the pixel 2xl keeps things
much more simple with just a single 12
megapixel shooter but it's proven itself
to be one of the best cameras on the
market and it's still able to achieve a
portrait mode through machine learning
they're both powered by Snapdragon
processors in the US with the newest 845
in the s9 plus and the 8:35 in the pixel
to XL which was the most
powerful Snapdragon processor last year
plenty of RAM on both of them as well
with six on the s9 + and four on the
pixel so there shouldn't be any issues
with performance and the 845 is not only
a faster chipset but it's also more
power efficient across the board on the
software front they both have Android or
EO but obviously the s9 plus is skinned
with Samsung's UI which is very
different from the stock experience of
the pixel and if you've used the SI or
note 8 you should feel right at home
there are some software changes with
improvements to Bixby the addition of ar
emojis and the camera software has been
cleaned up and easier to navigate but
otherwise it's a very familiar
experience so that about wraps up this
quick comparison between the samsung
galaxy s 9 + + google pixel to excel let
