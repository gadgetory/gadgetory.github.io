handy the Android authority app guy and
it is nearing the end of November which
means it's time to round up the best new
Android games from the last month if you
want to try out any of these games for
yourself you can find those links in the
video description below as full extreme
is the latest game in the asphalt
franchise unlike the prior game where
you drive cars over tracks Xtreme has
you driving off-road vehicles over
various off-road courses you'll have
about three dozen vehicles to unlock and
play with and it also includes a rather
lengthy campaign mode that includes
various challenges to help keep things
fresh there is also an online
multiplayer mode if you want to play
that it's a good-looking game with
decent mechanics the only caveat is it's
rather aggressive with its freemium
content
Astro frontier is the latest game out of
Khem Co a developer known for its mobile
RPG titles it plays like a classic JRPG
from the 1990s you'll be exploring
various places fighting bad guys and
trying to save the world it also
includes an elemental stone mechanic to
help liven things up a bit players will
notice that it is a little dry and there
is tons of dialog otherwise it's a fun
experience for those who like a retro
feel to their RPG experience it's $4.99
but there are no in-app purchases
Batman the telltale series is an
episodic adventure game about Batman
from Telltale Games this adventure
follows Batman through a new storyline
that promises to be as gritty and
violent as the Batman series can get
you'll also meet a number of characters
from the Batman universe this one is
having more issues than usual for a
newly released game which is a bit of a
bummer
however telltale is known for their high
quality gameplay so we imagine that
these issues will be worked out
eventually for now keep this one on your
radar eisenhorn xenos is an adventure
game that takes place in the Warhammer
40,000 universe
it's also based on a book by the same
name you'll play as Gregor eisenhorn an
Inquisitor that has some stuff that
needs to be done you'll be fighting bad
guys and exploring the world under this
premise it has pretty decent graphics
and gameplay along with some special
powers to help you along the way it's
also fully voice-acted if that matters
to you it's $5.99 with no in-app
purchases
dear club is a new racing game that
tries to focus more on realism it boasts
same mechanics engine that adheres to
realistic expectations of what a car can
do it also has some pretty decent
graphics on top of its looks you'll be
racing through various courses upgrading
and unlocking new vehicles and there is
an online multiplayer mode that you can
engage with like the Batman game
mentioned earlier this one has a few
more issues than what would be
considered normal for a new game it's a
free download if you want to try it out
Jade Empire is actually an old xbox game
from Bioware that has been officially
ported to Android this new special
edition contains the entire game that we
all know and loved from many years ago
along with additional content specific
to this mobile version the mechanics
have also been adapted for mobile and it
turned out pretty well this is a rather
large and epic game that boasts about 40
hours of gameplay it cost $9.99 but
there are no in-app purchases Microsoft
released their eponymous solitaire game
to Google Play the Microsoft solitaire
collection comes with a total of five
variants of solitaire including Klondike
which is the traditional version spider
free sell TriPeaks and pyramid the game
is entirely free to play and you can
replay them as often as you want you'll
have to deal with some advertisements
but otherwise the game is free you can
pop down some money for platinum status
which actually doesn't add all that much
but it will remove those advertisements
Necco collector is a port of the Easter
egg game in Android nougats it allows
most devices to play the game for a
little bit of fun truth be told there
isn't a lot to this game you laid out
some food a cat will show up and you'll
add it to your collection the goal is to
try to collect every cat it's a simple
game that doesn't take much battery and
it seems to work rather well it's also
completely free which is a plus pinout
is an arcade pinball game from the same
developers that brought a smash hit this
is an endless runner game with pinball
mechanics and you'll try to shoot the
ball through an infinite level to see
how far you can get it features bright
neon colors smooth gameplay and it
culminates in an excellent experience
that should leave you feeling elated
it's a time waster through and through
but it's free to play with no
advertising you can also throw down for
the full version if you want to which
includes a couple of extra features the
trail is a freemium game created by
Peter Molyneux for those who don't know
he's done a lot of work in the god game
genre including the mobile game godus
the tram will have you travelling down a
trail meaning travelers trading for
stuff and eventually
settling down to create your own town
you'll also craft stuff explore various
places and a whole lot more it has a
unique graphical style and it's an
overall enjoyable experience it's only
caveat is that it is a freemium game
with the usual pitfalls and that about
does it for this one folks if you want
