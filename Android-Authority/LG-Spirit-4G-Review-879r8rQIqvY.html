MetroPCS is the LG spirit 4G for you
find out in our review hey everybody I'm
Chris look now the LG spirit 4G
definitely has a lot going for it
especially for a phone that's only 200
bucks off contract there are some
downsides though so let's see if it's
worth your hard-earned cash
starting with the specs the LG spirit 4G
features a 1.2 gigahertz dual-core
Qualcomm Snapdragon processor 4.5 inch
qHD display with a resolution of 960 by
540 pixels one gig of ram and four gigs
of internal storage expandable via
microSD it has five megapixel and 1.3
megapixel rear and front facing cameras
respectively and is capable of capturing
1080p video all of this is powered by a
2150 milliamp hour battery the build
quality of the LG spirit for G feels
generally sturdy while still keeping the
phone light I'm normally a big fan of
the design of LG devices but this time
not quite so much maybe it's the
electric razor look of the textured
plastic the phone isn't ugly but I don't
love the look as much as I do with
higher-end LG phones the spirit 4G has a
nice feel to it and should fit easily in
most hands I did find the power button
on the right side was placed a little
too high for my tastes but this is a
relatively minor issue the display has
its share of pluses and minuses starting
with the negatives the 960 by 540
resolution is a little lower than we'd
like to see on the plus side it doesn't
look bad at all on the 4.5 inch screen
if we were looking at a 5 inch plus
display this would be a much bigger
issue than it is colors are vivid and
textin icons are rendered very sharply
we've seen better displays on high-end
phones of course but for the price this
is very good I know what to usually
expect from a combination of a dual-core
Qualcomm Snapdragon chipset and a lower
res display so I was expecting a
performance to be fairly good I
it's still surprised at how well this
phone performed while the average antutu
benchmark score of around eleven
thousand eight hundred isn't incredibly
impressive real-world performance was
very good scrolling through various
screens was always smooth apps launched
quickly and the games we threw at it
worked very well
running Epic Citadel in benchmark mode
was impressive especially the final
average frame rate of 59 frames per
second it's disappointing but the LG
spirit 4G runs Android 4.0.4 Ice Cream
Sandwich and as of right now there
haven't been any concrete announcements
of a jellybean update as usual LG is
running its own skin on top so don't
expect the stock Android interface the
usual Google apps including Chrome are
included and a bunch of other apps from
LG and metro pcs if you're like me and I
know I am you'll probably never use them
the five megapixel rear facing camera is
usable but not too impressive
it'll take a picture of whatever you
pointed at but chances are good that the
picture won't be anything too special
the front facing camera shares this
issue colors aren't especially vivid and
images tend towards the washed outside
the 1080p video capture is sharp and
motion is smooth but the video has the
same somewhat bland look as photos do
while the battery capacity of 2150
milliamp hours may seem on the small
side the combination of a low pixel
count and a Snapdragon chipset squeezes
quite a bit of life out of it during
testing I was running benchmarks games
playing videos and eventually even tried
to kill the battery by letting Epic
Citadel run endlessly and I still got
over seven hours the battery is
replaceable as well which is nice to
know if the power runs down over time
to sum up the LG spirit 4G is easily one
of the best options available in its
price range on metro pcs performance is
great so if you can deal with a few
minor issues it's a great pick for $200
contract free still haven't made up your
mind or just want to know more well we
