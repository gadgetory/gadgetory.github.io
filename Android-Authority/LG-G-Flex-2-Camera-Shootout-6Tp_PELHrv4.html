for this particular video but
nonetheless it's Josh of Agartha
mandroid authority what's going on
everybody and every photo and video that
you're seeing in this camera shootout
was taken on the cameras of the LG G
flex 2 why don't we get a couple of the
modes out of the way after all there are
very few here's a look at the HDR that
does lighten up the darks quite a bit
and adds a little bit of color
saturation to the photos but it's not
that pronounced of an effect the
panorama mode does stitch together the
photos quite nicely but I did not have
any moving subjects in the still photo
so we will probably see some stitching
if there was but let's go ahead and get
into some outdoor shots here you can see
here that the color saturation is
actually quite nice and if we go into
the 100 crops there we do have a good
level of detail despite a little bit of
smudging in the smoothness around those
details but nonetheless the photos do
look quite nice they do have the right
color reproduction with a little bit of
saturation not a very high amount as I'm
usually used to from other competitors
in the market today but nonetheless as
you can see in the 100 crops we are
getting a nice amount of detail
nonetheless you will see later that this
amount of detail does happen to go down
a little bit which is a bit of a bummer
but we're gonna get into that in a
little bit after these next couple of
photos I did want to talk to you about
the laser guided autofocus it is a
wonderful feature to have on the LG G
flex 2 and the flagship G lines but what
I will say is that because you have to
pinpoint the focus point you might have
a bit of trouble tracking your subject
if you have a small or thin object
inside of your photos you're going to
see that there are some problems keeping
it in focus as you are continuously
trying to tap on the screen just to be
able to get it and you can see that
effect happening here especially when
I'm trying to finally focus the shot but
of course the other benefit of this
camera is the OIS Plus which helps with
video just as much as it does with photo
you will have steadier shots especially
if you put a little bit of effort into
studying your hands and you will
compensate for what's left in your
shakiness for a video or a photo
now here unfortunately is where we start
to see some changes the indoor shots
here are going to show you how the
detail does get lost as you lower the
amount of light that is in your shot
these pictures of mega men as I go into
the 100 crops on his face make it clear
that despite there being a lot of detail
in the contours of mega man's face there
they just happen to be a little bit
blurred out or to smooth out is the term
that we're looking for here I'm taking
more shots indoors and you can also see
that the color saturation is starting to
go down a little bit especially when you
have multiple exposures in one shot
let's say a harsh lighting coming from
the left side or the right side whereas
everything else is a little bit darker
because we're indoors you'll see that
the camera has a little bit of a harder
time trying to get the correct exposure
and call a reproduction it's a bit of a
bummer and coupled with the loss of
detail in the sharpness we have some
problems with the camera already in this
particular situation and it will only
get worse when you get into much lower
lighted situations you can already see
in this low-light video just how much
the details get fuzzy and this is true
for both the photo and video in these
indoor shots we do see quite a bit of a
change from the outdoor shots in terms
of pretty much everywhere in terms of
these photos and their quality and in
these videos the only thing I can really
say is really great about these indoor
videos as the os+ helping with my
shakiness
speaking of shakiness I was trying to
get a good picture of Ichi the dog right
here and despite my pressing on the
viewfinder to make the laser-guided auto
focus really try to pinpoint the subject
unfortunately he was moving around so
much that I wasn't able to really get a
good shot off in the end I had to just
pick up the little guy myself and try to
get a shot that way but luckily he was
able to stand still for a second and I
was able to get a very nice looking shot
here with some actually pretty good
detail especially in his snout there
especially if you're dealing with the
minimalized user interface on the G flex
2 s camera we're pretty much dealing
with a simple camera experience here you
just have to tap on the screen in order
to get the laser guide out of focus to
focus and then you get your shot right
away it's a very fast camera to use and
it's something that I really enjoy so
what
focusing on here are the low-light
capabilities or the indoor capabilities
whereas the outdoor capabilities are
actually quite nice but now we're seeing
a lot of smudges around the details and
unfortunately it's a bit of a bummer to
see that this is the case with the G
flex 2 s camera I did want to take just
a couple of selfies here and I am going
to go away from the G flex 2 s camera
just to show you the effect that is
available here when you take a selfie
with this particular camera you can just
move your hand downward in a very
natural curved motion and you'll be able
to take a look at your self-portraits
right away it's a nice feature to have
an allows you to take a look at the
front-facing camera capabilities which
actually are still pretty standard as
always thank you guys very much for
watching and I hope you enjoyed this
camera shootout for the LG G flex 2 it
is an iteration that comes from the
original g3 that now comes with the
laser guided autofocus and Ã³as plus
both are things that make this camera
one of the easiest to use out there and
you are able to get some really good
shots out from it but unfortunately the
quality can be somewhat uneven as you
saw in my indoor line of shots even we
already saw some loss in the detail and
a lowered color saturation so you might
not be able to get a great shot every
single time but I do still think that
this camera is one of my favorites to
use mostly because of its ease of
handling and its speed but nonetheless
keep it tuned to Android Authority for
