excited to be able to go hands-on with
the Nvidia shield let's get some of
these cards out of the way some free
hands over there too anyway so we have
the actual I suppose we'll say here is
it's like a mobile console and you'll
see the reason why I say that a little
bit later on but as for our first
impressions basically it feels just too
just like any good quality
controllership because there are all the
bits and pieces in there especially with
tegra 4 and 720p display that we're
going to flip up in just a little bit
and all of the controls there is a bit
of a heft to it but that is definitely
to its advantage it has a very good feel
already from the beginning and then when
we open up the screen you'll see it is
Android jellybean through and through so
I'm just going to take a look at it
pretty much it's like Al and a
permanently landscape version of the
Android jelly bean operating system I
guess the good example to use here is
the updated not yet released version of
dead trigger 2 made for tegra 4
we're going to open that up I'll get an
exit over here and we'll start our own
missions for an android game and its
really awesome just how great this looks
such a nice looking game running around
using both analog sticks just like you
really should on a console gaming
machine suppose I canvas print but
that's okay and you'll come the zombies
tricks are for kids
oh oh oh it's getting wild cut tonight
so you can see just how awesome the
other behind me there behind me
back to the gun I'm even losing myself
right now in the game it just feels so
nice and if I lift it off of the display
here I'm about to die all right there
you go if I even lift it off of the
display it really does feel very nice in
the hand it's okay this is this is
pretty much the closest thing you'll get
to a full console especially considering
you'll be able to stream your pc games
to the display on the shield and it's
going to be a wonderful experience I can
tell you that much right now everything
feels really sturdy nothing feels too
plasticky to light everything just feels
really nice they said there were
improvements on the triggers and those
work really well I'm just killing all
these zombies coming my way see if we'll
do a quick knife fight one more before I
close this out
got nothing got nothing yeah all right
so that does it for our quick hands-on
at Google i/o of the shield I can tell
you right now it's a very very high
quality fielding device it already looks
great it's it's more than just an
android phone or android screen on top
of controller it really is some of its
all parts and it's a really good looking
device that feels really great at the
end sure they're really fun I'm about to
die again so I'm just gonna rage quit
alright so once again it's Joshua
vergara giving you a quick look at the
Nvidia shield here at Google i/o 2013</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
