with some of my first impressions of the
LG g2 one of the biggest deals in my
opinion is that the g2 is among the
first phones to use Qualcomm Snapdragon
800 chipset we were asked not to run
benchmarks a nice guy that I am I didn't
but that didn't stop others and from
what we've seen performance on the g2 is
awesome not really a surprise but still
worth mentioning I'm a little surprised
that reaction of the buttons being on
the back of the phone has been so cool
for one it's part of why the bezel is so
tiny plus it's a lot nicer to use in
person than people seem to be imagining
just being able to change the volume mid
call without fumbling around is pretty
neat like the Moto X we recently
reviewed LG says they based the design
of the g2 on analysis of the human grip
and like the X it uses a stepped battery
to help achieve this shape while the
3,000 milliamp hour battery is
definitely not small LG is taking steps
to provide even longer battery life by
reducing g ram power use when the image
on screen is still which on a phone is a
whole lot of the time from what I've
seen in the phones being announced the
past few weeks it seems like gestures
are about to become a big deal at least
for a while LG uses gestures for guest
mode as well as slide aside which allows
you to slide apps to the left to keep
them in a saved state and slide them
back to the right to get them back then
we have knock knock which allows you to
tap twice on the phone screen to turn it
on and tap twice on an empty area on the
screen to turn it back off another thing
that seems to be very popular lately is
using your phone as a TV remote so the
g2 has a built-in IR blaster and
accompanying TV app say what you will
but this is definitely handy and
something I really like seeing in
flagships one thing I wasn't able to
test was the camera unlike Motorola
using a different RGB see sensor to
improve low-light photography LG is
opting for using optical image
stabilization which should allow longer
exposure times without the blur that you
normally see with them now I've seen
this work on DSLR cameras and
is effective but it remains to be seen
how well it will work in a phone now
another neat touches that you can just
pick up the phone and answer it somebody
raised a good point though what if it's
somebody you don't want to talk to how
do you know who it is first LG has a
pretty cool answer for this you pick up
the phone and you see who's calling but
it's not until you hold it to your ear
that you actually answer it now this is
a gesture i could see misfiring quite a
bit but if it actually works it would be
really cool LG's promised us that will
see a review unit really soon so stay
tuned for the official take on the LG g2
I'm Chris Walken as always thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
