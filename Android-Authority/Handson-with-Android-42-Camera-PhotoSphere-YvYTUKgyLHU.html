Youngberg from Android Authority calm
today I'm going to be doing a review of
the brand new photosphere option that
comes with the camera in Android 4.2 I
actually installed this camera simply an
apk as you can see we do have our front
facing camera activated right now so
we're going to go ahead and switch your
back but anyways I did install the apk
you have to be rooted and you flash it
just like a ROM it's a flashable zip use
clockworkmod recovery or any custom
recovery that you want you simply
install the APK or you can just install
the APK if you have a Galaxy Nexus so
anyways this is the brand new UI that
comes with the Android 4.2 camera so you
can see here we have a completely
revamped user interface it's not really
too much along the lines of the holo
design that they were going with the Ice
Cream Sandwich camera and that they
retained in the early builds of
jellybean so anyways when we're talking
about the UI of this brand new camera we
can go ahead and check out our settings
menu which is this circle now go ahead
and press the circle we have access to
our flash our white balance our scene
modes and then our front-facing and
rear-facing camera configuration this is
our slider setting here we can access
our scene modes but we'll go ahead and
go back check out our front-facing
really quick of course I'm rocking the
Samsung Galaxy s3 what's up everyone go
ahead and switch it back I do have the
Verizon version by the way so let's try
out a photosphere once we're in the
camera just like this we can click the
camera icon and then simply click the
photosphere icon we can also click
panorama or video we'll go ahead and
click the photosphere now as you can see
that user interface of the photosphere
starts off with just one image but we're
going to be overlaying the images onto a
complete 360 sphere so we actually get
the 360 degree panorama and what it
wants us to do is align to start so
we're going to go ahead and tilt our
phone up until we tap that little blue
ball you can stop at any time as well
you can also move the camera to the side
in order to capture an image to the left
we do the same to capture an image to
the right top the diagonal going down
any direction you want actually got my
hand in there so that's kind of going to
ruin that image but we'll go ahead and
continue up here and we can basically
capture anywhere we want 360 degrees we
could turn it all the way around if we
want to do to where it's actually point
behind us and we get notifications like
too fast if we're going too fast other
stuff to warn us if we're not going to
get a good image but basically you can
track the creation of a 360 degree
panorama as you're creating it just
because you have it right here on your
screen really great you can click the
back if you don't want to continue the
photo or the physical back button if you
have one and you can click stop and
it'll actually render the photo and when
it's rendering the photo you'll have a
nice notification up here that it says
creating panorama and to view your
images of course we're going to want to
go into our gallery so our camera here
and here's our image I didn't get an
overly huge one but I did get a few of
the others so you can pinch in scroll to
this one a few other nice images I'm
going to go ahead and do one off camera
just because it's a little easier I
won't be able to show you guys the
entire 360 degree view but I'll do an
off camera ever so quickly and then come
back and show you guys alright everyone
this is the complete 360 degree image
that I actually took right here zoom in
this is in all four directions north
south east and west people complete 360
degrees this is behind me actually and
then we can go over to the left it
merges it in a nice panoramic view it
it's taking the 360 degrees and just
completely putting it on one plane for
viewing is my baby got my truck parked
right here doing the filming and we can
scroll through oh whoops actually went
farther in my gallery we can go ahead
and scroll through and this edge right
here is actually met up by this one 360
degrees it's a really awesome feature
Google baked into its camera plenty of
other awesome features come with Android
4.2 of course we got a coverage for all
the different phones that are available
including the Samsung Galaxy s3 check
out the apk for the brand-new camera if
you've got a Google Nexus and stay
