Android authority and HTC Desire lineup
has always been pretty popular but they
usually don't make it to carriers in the
United States but we finally gotten one
that many consumers can now get their
hands on let's take a look at the HTC
Desire 610 so let's jump right into it
starting with the design of the Desire
610 and it's very similar to its bigger
brother the desire 816 just in a much
smaller form factor it's entirely made
of plastic so it's not going to exude
the same premium feel as the HTC One m8
the back is glossy while the sides are
matte so the glossy back is prone to
fingerprints and light scratches and it
does feel a little bit slippery in the
hand but overall it's very well built it
is a pretty decent looking phone so I
don't think many people will have too
many complaints about the design but it
does have some really thick bezels on
all sides of the device which I feel is
making the phone bigger than it really
needs to be especially for its screen
size all the buttons and ports are in
their typical locations for an HTC phone
with the power button and 3.5 millimeter
headset jack up top volume rocker on the
right side microUSB port on the bottom
and your sim and SD card slot which
support up to 128 gigs is located on the
left side covered by a single flap even
though the desire 6/10 is a relatively
low end device that didn't stop HTC from
including their front-facing boomsound
speakers which has sort of become one of
HTC's signature design cues the quality
might not be quite as good as the One m8
but they're still front-facing speakers
and certainly sound better than any
phone out there with a back facing
single
taking a look at the display it's a 4.7
inch LCD with a resolution of 960 by 540
so it's a pretty low res display and
with such a low resolution pixels
definitely are noticeable when reading
text or looking at graphics and you're
not going to be able to watch content in
HD the color calibration is questionable
and the viewing angles certainly aren't
the best but it does get pretty bright
so outdoor visibility is an issue but
other than that this display doesn't
have much going for it for a 4.7 inch
screen I would have liked to see it come
with at least 720p resolution inside the
HTC Desire 610 is being powered by a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor with
one gig of ram which is pretty typical
specs when it comes to mid to low end
devices but the Desire 610 actually
performs quite well through everyday
usage I didn't run into any major
problems with lag or anything like that
swiping and scrolling is still pretty
smooth apps open relatively quickly
multitasking wasn't a problem and games
played on it just fine without any
issues it probably also helps out quite
a bit that the processor doesn't have as
many pixels to push around due to the
low resolution display around the back
you're going to find an 8 megapixel
camera with LED flash and as far as the
camera interface goes it's pretty much
the same as what you'll find on other
HTC phones it's a really simplistic and
clean interface and you've got all of
your standard settings like ISO exposure
value white balance HDR etc it is a
slightly more watered down version in
comparison to what you'll find on
something like the HTC One m8 there's no
you focus or any of that 3d stuff
obviously because the camera isn't
capable and if you want zoe's you'll
have to use HTC beta Zoe application the
picture quality however is pretty
unimpressive photos lack a lot of
sharpness they just appear very soft
around the edges and noisy colors look
washed out and you can pretty much
forget about taking photos in low-light
is this camera going to stop you from
posting to social networks probably not
but don't expect anything spectacular
out of this camera
when it comes to the battery life it's
got a 2040 milliamp hour battery inside
which sounds really small especially
compared to some of the major flagships
out there nowadays with 3000 milliamp
hour batteries but even with a battery
of just barely over two thousand
milliamp hours I was able to make it
through a full day of normal usage
without a whole lot of trouble
keep in mind the display is pretty low
resolution so it's not going to draw a
whole lot of power like it would with a
1080p display or a 2k display so whether
I was texting browsing the web checking
social networks watching YouTube or
playing a few games here and there the
battery life seemed to hold up pretty
well on the software side of things the
Desire 610 is running on Android 4.4.2
KitKat with HTC Sense 6 software and if
you use any HTC device as of late the
experience on the 610 will be very
familiar terra-tory you've got all the
same features that were used to by now
with sense 6 from the vertical scrolling
app drawer blinkfeed
on the leftmost home screen and HTC zone
customization options since this is the
AT&amp;amp;T model of the desire 610 there's
also no shortage of ATT bloatware
pre-installed either if you love HTC
devices and you're a fan of simplicity
and cleanness of the scent 6 software
you will definitely feel right at home
with the Desire 610 the Desire 610 is
available now on 18t for a price of 99
cents on a two-year contract or $200 if
you decide to buy outright and it does
support LTE connectivity as well which
is always good it's a pretty reasonable
price given that this is a rather low
end smartphone so obviously if you have
to have the best of the best this phone
isn't going to be for you but not
everyone out there needs the latest and
the greatest smart phone some people
just need a phone that works and if
that's what you're looking for or if you
know someone that would benefit greatly
from a phone like this the Desire 610 is
a great option without breaking the bank
but that is it for this review of the
HTC Desire 610 if you're looking for a
phone with HTC's signature features and
a budget-friendly pack
age the desire 6:10 is an overall very
solid option anyways thank you so much
