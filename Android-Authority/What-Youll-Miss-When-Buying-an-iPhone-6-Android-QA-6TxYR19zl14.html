you by HipChat wait wait before you go
to the dark side and buy an iPhone hear
me out you don't want to be known as
someone who follows the I she I'll right
oh right oh right so all joking aside no
really all joking aside we got to talk
about that dilly what are you giving up
when you move from the Android ecosystem
to iOS
you're giving up quite a bit you're also
gaining some things too but some ground
rules cuz things get stupid around here
when we start talking about Android
versus iOS number one just because you
own an iOS device doesn't make you a bad
person doesn't make you a nice sheep but
in some cases it makes you uninformed
and my job here is to make you informed
if you choose to pull the trigger so
here we go we're going to start off with
a relationship analogy iPhone is
possibly a gorgeous prospective partner
but iPhone wants you to be the way it
wants you to be whereas Android loves
you for who you are and let's start with
customization and choice this has always
been a major plus point for Android you
can mix and match apps and widgets any
way you like to create a truly unique
look on your home screen you can even
set up widgets and apps and shortcuts on
your lockscreen
you have a wide choice of different
unlock methods and customization options
by default but there's also a lot of
third-party apps and launchers that
allow you to customize every aspect of
the aesthetic including animations and
layout with the iPhone you have a list
of installed apps you can choose a
background photo and create folders of
apps but that's about it
Apple has added widgets to the
Notification Center
but that means opening it up and
choosing the today tab to found them in
Android widgets are all about being
glanceable so you can take a look at
your lockscreen or home screen and
instantly find the information that you
want they also come in a wide range of
different styles that can often be fully
customized in terms of size color font
and of course the data they display if
you spend time crafting the visual style
and functionality of your lockscreen and
home screen
you're definitely going to miss it if
you've spent time crafting the visual
style and functionality of your lock or
home screen on Android you're definitely
going to miss it if you move to iOS now
the second thing you're going to miss is
the tight integration with Google Apps
services there has been a Google
presence on iOS since the original
iPhone was launched though it has been
gradually replaced in recent years there
are a few apps like Google keep that you
simply can't get on the iPhone but even
the Google apps and services that are
present don't match their Android
counterparts if you want to get the best
from Google now chrome Gmail Google Maps
and many others then you really want to
use an Android device this is becoming a
bigger deal all the time as Google looks
to add more value to its version of
Android in the face of Android fork
systems Google apps and services are
improving faster than ever before now
the third thing you're going to want to
be aware of is androids drag-and-drop
filing system with an Android device you
can actually see the file structure
something which Apple deliberately tries
to hide you usually find a file manager
of some sort pre-installed on your
Android device but if not there are
plenty of them in the Play Store for
free there will be no consequence for
some people but a lot of Android fans
enjoy the ability to plug in their phone
or tablet and just drag and drop files
into the folder wherever they want them
now the fourth thing you're going to
miss is Android notifications and they
are far and away
much better than iOS notifications
you've got a list of incoming
notifications you can act on directly or
dismiss small icons in the status bar
indicate what awaits you and serve as a
reminder of tasks or items you still
need to deal with if you don't want apps
to notify you then you can turn off
notifications in the settings you can
also choose them to see them in the
lockscreen
in Android 5.0 lollipop you can even set
priority notifications so what's
important rises to the top now
personally this is one of my favorite
things about Android notifications I can
turn my ringer off or notifications off
indefinitely or for a set specific time
I can only allow priority calls in but
exclude everything else that is super
practical
fantastic job android/ios can't do that
now this isn't going to matter to
everyone but for those of you who really
want to unleash the power of Android we
got to talk about routing and custom
roms for a minority of Android users
with the knowledge confidence and
interest the ability to route your
device and install mods is unparalleled
you can access and tweak nearly every
aspect of your Android device and get
the exact setup you want there is a
lively modding community working on all
sorts of interesting options
xda-developers comm is the best place to
start if you've never explored this side
of android now yes you can jailbreak
your iPhone but even then you never get
the same freedom that you get with
Android now we got to talk about the
intangibles when it comes to Android
versus iOS and this is a big factor my
daughter for example loves her iPhone
primarily because a lot of her friends
have iPhones and that social pressure is
a big factor but if you're going to make
the decision make the decision because
the iPhone is best for you not because
your friends have done it but we got to
talk about one thing why would the
iPhone be good for you now if I were to
go back to the iPhone it's probably
unlikely but if I did it would be for
simplicity sake the reality is like many
of you I've had an iTunes account for
some 13 years and I have a lot of iTunes
content and syncing that content between
various iOS devices and Mac devices it's
just easier that's just a fact I use
doubleTwist to sync from my iTunes to my
Android devices but it's a little bit of
a pain in the butt it's the best
solution thus far but if simplicity
sheer simplicity is number one priority
for you maybe you want to go for an
iPhone but if you do you want to be an
educated informed iOS user now our team
