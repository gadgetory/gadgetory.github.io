this is clayton youngberg coming at you
from the one and only android authority
calm today we're reviewing two cases
from I talk online co dot UK you can
pick these up there or on amazon com
we've got our blue gel case with a
silicone exterior and we've got our
leather purple case here which is a
folder so anyways let's just open these
up put them on our pebble blue galaxy s3
because the dark schemes are going to
match is open this one you see most of
these uh gel cases come in little
plastic sleeves like that anyways this
is a silicone gel case it's going to fit
perfectly to the blue pebble blue galaxy
s3 now the blue background behind the
blue case looks awesome we have all of
our cutouts we have a micro USB our
small Mike of course our headphone jack
there got our LED our camera and our
speaker our power button and volume
buttons are easy to press the power
button is a little harder to press the
knee volume buttons but the volume
buttons Rock side to side nicely I love
the look of the blue one it does have a
little bit of a raised edge there just
in case you were to drop it face down
but it's not going to be a heck of a lot
of protection just a small small edge on
there anyways that's a great case let's
check out their other case here this
purple leather folder here what
intrigues me about this is that there's
actually cutouts for the LED speaker and
camera unlike most other peripheral
cases I mean a leather cases not purple
cases and this is also really cool we've
got a hard case that's situated within
the leather here I've also got some
credit card holders and whatnot here and
a nice little sleeve to hold stuff there
so anyways going to snap our galaxy s3
in here looks awesome we can shut this
we have access to all three of our usual
cutouts their access to our headphone
jack got our micro USB on the bottom
this is a nice magnetic snapping utility
right here we have a nice little ring up
here for like a little lanyard and stuff
and we can open it up and we'll use just
one of our little squeegees
screen protectors slide in there have
your credit cards and everything ready
all in one little business portfolio
thing here access to our volume buttons
power button and it's easy we can use
our phone just like this not hard to
hold the case with the top part folded
back and it's a just an overall really
nice case guys so check out these cases
from the I talk online co uk just
another great addition to the entire
extensive collection of galaxy s3 cases
