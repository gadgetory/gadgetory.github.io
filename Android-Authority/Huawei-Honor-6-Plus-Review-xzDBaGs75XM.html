their very well-regarded ascend mate 7
which is currently one of the best
selling phones out in the East but their
smartphone pedigree also includes a line
with an interesting and intriguing name
what does why we have to offer in a
larger version of the alternative
flagship smartphone well let's find out
because it's Joshua gar from Android
authority what's going on everybody and
this is my full review of the Huawei
honor 6 plus in a stark departure from
the metal construction of the ascend
made 7 the honor 6 plus takes
inspiration from a couple of different
places in order to make a simplistic but
very attractive device the metal frame
going around the phone is reminiscent of
the iPhone or even the Samsung Galaxy
Note 4 altogether making up flat sides
everywhere but the bottom moving
downward from the metal frame reveals a
curved separation that makes way for a
plastic bottom this is a design element
that reminded me very much of the Sony
Xperia line from which the honor seems
to get its dual glass panel choice as
well while the headphone jack in the
microUSB port are up top and on the
bottom respectively the button layout is
on the right side above to pop out trays
for the sim and microSD cards or if you
so choose a dual SIM setup and on the
back the honor logo is simplistically
shown in the middle underneath the dual
camera optics setup in the corner
there's something really nice about
having the word honor on the back they
makes me feel optimistic about this
phone almost who's simplistically
elegant design gives some idea of what
the experiences can be had underneath I
already had a good response to the
handling of the honor as the 5.5 inch
screen is helped by the flat sides and
thin profile making for a phone just
outside the comfort of one-handed usage
at least for me it's almost as if while
we looked at some of the best features
found on other greatly designed phones
and put a few of them on their
particular handsets and in the honor 6
plus I did see a black version of it
back at that media tour that I did with
Huawei and it looked incredibly sleek as
well but on the white version for lack
of a better term
it just looks simply clean the 5.5 inch
display provides 1080p resolution with
401 pixels per inch but what makes this
screen stand out is it's screen to body
ratio which comes in at around 73% this
ratio is one of the reasons why this
larger form factor is still pretty
accessible in the honor 6 plus and we're
always fans of
Bezos on our screens the IPS
construction brings a high level of
brightness to the phone even in broad
daylight and the viewing angles are all
great as well making the screen almost
look like a sticker on the phone because
the color fidelity doesn't suffer at
acute angles but it's in the colors that
I found a very enjoyable experience the
colorful emotion UI really comes out of
the screen very well with good if not
slightly high saturation levels and the
standard level of sharpness in text
contrast is where it should be -
especially shown when playing various
video games even with the occasional
hand gymnastics the honor 6 plus manages
a very enjoyable display experience for
both work and play as has become
customary for huawei phones the honor 6
plus does not use a conventional chipset
that you would find in many of its
competitors instead Huawei constructs
their own processing packages and since
the main 7 we've been pretty impressed
with what they put out and as such the
high silicon 925 makes a return here for
some high-end performance mainly
providing a very smooth and speedy
experience through the emotion UI indeed
scrolling through all the various
elements yielded no problems and the
three gigabytes of RAM allowed for good
multitasking I had very few problems
with hiccups or even stutters on the
honour and experience continued even
when gaming the recently released WWE
immortals moved along smoothly and
without incident giving the molle t-62
8mp for a few points in Huawei's
architecture in the graphics department
we learned from our media tour with
Huawei that because of their experience
in wireless communications and thus the
processors needed in order to make those
happen it only made sense for them to do
the same with their particular
smartphone handsets and if the ascend
made seven and now the honor 6 plus or
any indication high silicon is
definitely fulfilling that promise now
on a simplistically designed phone like
the honor you won't find much more than
the conventional additions but the
essentials are definitely there you
won't be finding extra features on the
honor like the fingerprint scanner from
the mate7
but then again Huawei does like to
distinguish among their various flagship
sets a microSD card slot is located
right under the SIM tray and it can
actually work like a SIM tray if you
want to rock a dual sim setup call
quality was where it should be though I
will admit that the call volume was a
little low for my tastes and in
connecting to the general networks here
in the West I wasn't surprised that this
Chinese version of the phone would have
some trouble connecting to my LTE
networks here in California but that
being said
on the ATT network the HSPA+ connection
was very reliable and I was able to rely
on it throughout most of my daily usage
the rear-facing speaker was a bit of a
letdown as its loudness was stifled by a
pretty narrow soundstage
now one thing that I did notice was a
lack of NFC which seemed a little
peculiar to me I realized it after I
tried to pair my phone to my car stereo
system and no matter how much I tapped
the back of the phone to it I got
nothing and battery life was a pretty
big deal for the ascend mate line but
with a larger form factor the honor 6
plus it did hope to be on par with its
bigger sibling and for the most part it
provided enough power to get through a
full day with some leftover with a
little bit of frugal usage the 3600
milliamp hour battery got a day and a
half with few problems but even on the
HSPA+ connection it struggled to get
anything more the honor 6 plus has one
main claim to fame and it is the dual
camera setup made in a similar fashion
to the dual camera from the HTC one as
such the optics are supposed to retrieve
depth information in the scene and
provide the ability to set a focal point
the result is a photo with DSLR like
depth of field but before we get to that
let's take a look at the app much like
other camera applications from Huawei
going between main modes involves swipes
on the viewfinder but other modes are
accessed via a button on the side these
modes include HDR best photo panorama
and a super night mode that does enhance
very dark scenes despite the loss of
quality and the grain that you would
probably expect and because this is
basically a slow shutter speed mode you
do have to keep the phone steady or use
a tripod HDR did a pretty good job
enhancing a scene as well owing to the
benefit of different exposures being
captured simultaneously but its effect
is not quite as strong as from other
competitors video modes include Full HD
quality recording which did look pretty
good but does suffer from the lack of
optical image stabilization so you need
to have steady hands pictures in general
look quite good I liked the color
saturation and the details were captured
well in the main auto mode the speed of
capture on this camera was also a plus
making this a pretty good everyday
camera companion but my problem happens
to be with the supposed effects and
benefits of the dual camera setup one in
the so called
wide aperture mode you can tap on a
focal point and adjust the aperture
which is the term that you're using for
what is otherwise a D focusing mode by
the way you can fine-tune the focus in
the gallery as well after the fact so
you're never really tied to the level
that you're chosen obviously this means
that the depth of field work is done on
the software side when used on that
point you can essentially blur out the
rest of the photo
other than that particular area
but while these effects do mimic the
same procedure on DSLRs the main big
reason for choosing low aperture in the
first place isn't even found here
improving that low-light performance
more than anything else my issue is just
with the usage of the term aperture this
dual camera setup is nothing new and in
the honor 6 plus it's actually a pretty
good iteration but using the word
aperture just bothers me a little bit
because it really is only half of the
truth when it comes to their usage of it
here in the honor 6 plus the emotion UI
is the OS of choice for Huawei and as
far as Asian operating systems go it's a
sleek and good-looking one in comparison
a highly colorful and clean aesthetic
makes home screens nice to navigate
through the folders and some
organization will be needed due to the
lack of an Abbe drawer the soft keys on
the bottom are customizable and can be
swiped away if you want to open up some
real estate
and speaking of customization you can
theme the entire interface using the
built-in engine even input
customizations are available like
gestures on the locked screen in order
to easily get into various functions of
the phone the main highlights for me in
the emotion UI included the notification
drop-down which nicely shows your
notifications in a reverse chronological
timeline and the nice transitions in and
out of applications that the hisilicon
processor helps present with few hiccups
now since I'm using the Chinese version
of the phone the main gripe would be a
lack of Google Play services now it's
easy enough to search by du for
applications or as I eventually did
install the Play Store to get all of
your applications easily but without
services syncing contacts it meant
extracting them from another one of my
phones via bluetooth all in all the
combination of nice performance and a
lovely screen helped elevate what is
already a nice looking interface in the
emotion UI but without Google Play
services it is a little bit tough for a
westerner like me to convert to it fully
officially the honor 6 plus is available
in China and parts of Europe for a price
that basically converts to around $400
that's a pretty great price for a
high-end device though plenty of other
Chinese based manufacturers have been
able to meet or even surpass this price
point
there are also some competitors that
offer extra features like the rotating
camera of the oppo n3 or the fast
charging capabilities found on plenty of
its other rivals and not to mention the
ascend mate 7 itself that does come a
little bit higher in price what also
comes with a very great fingerprint
scanner
maybe it's just me but fixating on the
word honor seems to imply simplicity and
if nothing else the honor 6 plus
succeeds at bringing the essentials in
the simplistically elegant design on its
aesthetic and performance you can mostly
justify the price points but claims
about the camera where the focus no pun
intended and on that front the dual
camera setup proves to be more of a
gimmick than a game-changer a dual
camera setup is nothing new at this
point and while the so called wide
aperture mode is functional and arguably
useful the camera does nothing else to
really differentiate itself and in the
end that is really what the honor 6 plus
does it lays in the cut providing the
Huawei flavor of what we may otherwise
expect already from high-end devices if
there are more compelling features like
say a fingerprint scanner or the battery
life of the ascend main 7 the sum of its
parts might make this a standout winner
but instead what we have is another
admittedly great entry point into the
high-end market where there happens to
be quite a few filling that space
already as always thank you guys very
much for watching and I hope you enjoyed
this review of the Huawei honor 6 plus
as an alternative to the ascend mate
line and also the P series from Huawei
it is definitely a very nice entry point
into the high-end market it just doesn't
really differentiate itself that much
from other competitors that are
similarly priced as always keep it tuned
