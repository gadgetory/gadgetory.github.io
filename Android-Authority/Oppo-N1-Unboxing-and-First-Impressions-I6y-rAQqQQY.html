fans of the Oppo find five it was
essentially oh pose coming up party
directly into the top-tier smartphone
market about a month or two ago opal was
gracious enough to send me out for their
launch event for their brand-new
smartphone and for all intents and
purposes this and the next iteration by
Oppo definitely blows away the previous
one hey Josh regard from Andhra
Authority what's going on everybody and
we got our hands on it so it's time to
unbox the Oppo n1 okay before we even
get into the Oppo n1 I do have to put it
aside for a little bit because it does
not come alone that's because it comes
with this little guy right here yep
it's almost comedic how small this other
box is considering how big the phone
we're going to be looking at is but the
reason why this tiny little box comes is
because it is the old click this is a
small module that allows you to find
your phone if you happen to misplace it
because you hold the button on here and
it will make the phone pretty much
scream out loud the other way around
works as well you can get the phone to
look for the old click but the other
function of this is with the nice camera
that is available inside of the Oppo n1
this allows you to have a wireless
shutter now when you look at the module
itself it's actually pretty nice it's
has a nice design to it it's really
really understated and it's just this
nice little perfect circle with a little
bit of a clique to it and of course you
have to put the battery in yourself that
is included but we're going to worry
about that about that a little bit later
so that was the old clique put them on
the side and now we'll come right back
to the n1
and here it is the oppo and one now this
is a 5.9 inch screen device that fall
for all intensive purposes a very large
device
I definitely occupies all the space that
is available for my hand to find and
it's really hard for me to reach all the
way up to the top left so don't don't
expect this to be a one-handed phone by
any means but it does definitely have a
very very nice look all of the
literature will tell you that the Oppo
n1 is made of a ceramic like material
and I will tell you that it does have a
very premium feel we have a very very
nice understated back area along with
the camera that I'll just show you real
quick right now before I get into it is
a rotating camera this is a very unique
feature that opal has put into their n1
which we'll get to in a little bit but
otherwise you have just this nice sleek
white back and there is a small itching
right here in the middle you can
probably barely see it in the camera but
you can't see the logo right in the
middle there that is the touch area and
what it allows you to do is swipe it
back and forth when you're using the
phone because you may not be able to
reach everything on the screen once we
get over to the front we do have some
capacitive keys here at the bottom which
do add more girth to this already large
phone because the screen is five point
nine inches that's nearly a six inch
screen which puts it pretty much in the
territory of the Sony Xperia Z ultra and
just a little bit bigger than the note 3
territory alright let's take a second
here and talk about the camera now what
we have here is a very high-performing
camera and opal really stands behind the
quality of the camera but even more than
that they stand behind the fact that it
is articulating or rather it is rotating
that would allow a rear-facing camera to
become your high quality front-facing
camera now it doesn't only just go to
the front it also tilts down just a
little bit so no matter how you're using
the phone you should be able to get some
sort of shot especially for those of you
who love to take selfies this might be
exactly the phone you have been waiting
for as far as the color OS goes I do
think it has come quite a ways since the
operating system we saw in the Opel fine
5 in particular it pretty much looks
like less flashy or more understated
version of Android just with a little
bit more of an ethereal look to it and
when it comes to with colors and even
this wallpaper that depicts a nice Sun
sunset overall the desert horizon for
example so that's a quick look at the
Opel n1 in this unboxing and first
impressions I will say this with the
color OS and this lovely build quality
that is available on a pretty large
phone to be honest I will say that I'm
looking forward to reviewing the n1
especially considering that there's some
real out-of-the-box thinking here and
not to mention this rotating camera is
one of those out-of-the-box ideas as
always thank you guys very much for

impression of the Opel and one the full
