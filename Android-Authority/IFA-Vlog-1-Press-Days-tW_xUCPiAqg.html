authority and you can hear all the noise
behind me I am blogging from pep com
digital focus it is the end of the first
day of Aoife the actual official first
day it goes from the 5th and onward and
the thing is I've been here since the
first and all of the really major
announcements happened in the last few
days which made for some really really
tiring and busy days but now we are
finally on the first day of eva and kept
calm is the end of it and with this
event and being able to you know enjoy
myself a little bit me involved on of
course we are here at this event being
able to just relax a little bit because
now the storm has come and gone and once
again we've been able to weather it and
i want to thank all of you for being
there watching our videos and whatnot
but i also want to make sure to give you
a blog and just sort of give you our
experience here at Aoife in berlin I
hope you can hear me pretty well it is
really loud in here and i'm using this
mic right here but i'll just go through
what was going on in past few days of
course you guys already know about
samsung the galaxy note for the note
edge the gear s the gear VR so many
different devices that were brought out
there but really the main story there is
the fact that the Galaxy Note 4 is an
improvement
every way of the node 3 and really with
that metal design I'm sure everyone's
going to really like it and with all of
the all of the different features that
they baked into it it really is a pretty
cool feature phone but from there we
moved on and got to a sous and we did
take a look at the Zen watch and I do
have to say that the Zen watch does seem
to get it right a lot in the sense that
it is one of the devices in the Android
more family that gets closest to going
to the watch side of what is considered
SmartWatch whereas other devices seem to
focus on the smart part more often now
as we're talking about smartwatches we
think it a look at the LG G watch our
and it is a very interesting device in
terms of its look because it does a very
good job of really looking like a watch
and then you put the digital stuff on
top now whether or not it's going to be
accessible for everybody out there is
something that remains to be seen but
that's when i get into the Moto 360 the
Moto 360 might have a more simplistic
look when it comes to its round design
but I do have to admit that when I saw
it on a bunch of the people at the
motorola briefing earlier today I
thought that a lot of people really
rocked it really easily because that
phone does a good job of really getting
getting into people's style it doesn't
cramp your style whatsoever but earlier
today at that same event we also got to
see the brand new Moto X now obviously
we were not in Chicago to take a look at
the actual device during the reveal but
we were able to get a nice private
screening of the device and the model
360 and the Moto G in a great hotel here
in Berlin and we got a great look at the
phone I actually think that it's a
wonderful device especially considering
the fact that I really feel like certain
people
have on more than one occasion looked at
the phone that they had and said I wish
to said this I wish this had that I wish
it had this and for the most part the
Moto X has all those features such as if
they just threw everything it's a one
device and after putting their own moto
futures right on top of it I think it
really bolsters the whole package even
more and to be honest the only thing
that's really missing is expandable
storage but for some quite a few people
out there it's not really that big of a
deal Sony's Xperia line especially the
z3 does have an update to the general
line but i will say that it's not
necessarily the biggest upgrading going
to see but if you're not going to look
at the z3 then check out the z3 compact
check out the z3 tablet compact and
you're going to see exactly what should
be paid attention to when it comes to
Sony's products I really do think that
those are some pretty incredible devices
especially a tablet because it has the
smaller form factor that that takes the
design of the Xperia Z tablets that I
already really loved and what they ate
in form factor and the fact that you can
connect them to playstation playstation
4 and be able to remotely play your
games I think that's pretty incredible
but after all of that again I said the
first day of Eva's has started all of
the press they're done with all of the
reporting and all of the events over the
last few days and now we have the
general public for the most part coming
into the ephah shell floor so it's a
crazy town it is just packed full of
people and it's pretty crazy trying to
get around everywhere but it also adds
to the character of equal and trade
shows like this to be able to have that
much commotion and be a part of it all
and you're really seeing it behind me
right now
pepco initial focus like I said again
yesterday with showstoppers but this is
kept calm the funny thing about this pep
come is that obviously we're in Germany
so they have a lot of football or soccer
for though for my United States fans
there they have a lot of football based
items around here those whose ball
tables there's even a type of video
presentation that's showing sort of like
a like a soccer match or a football
match obviously there are World Cup
champions I don't blame them for having
it all over the place it does break my
heart a little bit being from the States
but you know what congratulations to
Germany and it's really funny that that
is the theme of this pep calm well
you're not going to be seen the samsungs
with Sony's and others like that around
here well you will be seeing all of the
companies that supplement those
experiences everything from Bluetooth
speakers to app developers to logitech
for example it's right over there on the
side you're going to see them around
here and be able to able to see what
they have in store for the coming year
and of course when it comes to
showstoppers I'm kept calm we have the
ability to enjoy ourselves a little bit
while still getting some work done and
that's exactly what I'm doing right now
bringing you this vlog and you're going
to see even more now that the storm has
passed we're going to have the next few
days i'm here until tuesday until the
nine so I plenty of time to bring even
