everybody and I'm here with David Emmel
what's P gonna stand for so we're gonna
do this whole Android pee thing here's
the thing folks Google really likes to
lay it on thick when it decides to lay
out the clues but sometimes what they do
is a total misdirect anyway so let's
take a look at all of the options from
where I'm sitting it can only be three
things Android pie or pecan pie or
pumpkin pie or whatever Android
peppermint and Android popsicle I'm
sucking but they're not I wish so
popsicle seems so obvious but then cake
can't came out of nowhere and then like
nougat they kind of begged this new God
they kind of backed themselves in a
corner with that one yeah I mean with
Oreo though like everyone knew it was
gonna be Oreo and then I don't think
everyone knew I was over you are I think
everyone knew it everyone thought it
should be Orion well other than that it
was just that weird like orange no I
mean come on I thought it was like
orange cream Pires alia no no I was just
gonna be orange but in that vein I mean
it could be pretzel pretzels are salty
nobody really got to be sweet I know I
know that's why I said that's a little
bit probably popsicle maybe like
petroleum jelly you don't eat what's
another pee like I want to think of like
this mama granite hey Street pastry
that's in general girl pop-tart okay
someone did say pop-tart on I think it
was Twitter or I think yeah I thought
pop-tart was pretty clever
PEP I'm close to okay poke I would love
that
yeah but again not a that is not a
dessert I wouldn't I'm close to putting
looking of foods that's that begin with
P look at that second one it's not
Android poop everybody uh just so that
yeah pear paprika and arrow this is not
a pumpkin purple carrot pump no pumpkins
are not sweet home visit recipe prickly
pear I would love it if they'd used
enunciation and had two words Android
prickly pear I'll live with a pea yeah
that'd be AI an apple but
like their fruits there they're healthy
I just realize we're missing one that I
think is so obvious
pasta pie Android has a long history
with pies before it became KitKat the
rumored frontrunner for Android K was
key lime pie and after that lemon
meringue pie for Android L now there's a
history of Pi in Android but they ended
up not really going with those names
before but it would make sense if Google
is considering it again oh what about
pepper man Oh perfect
Efrem is pretty good I think okay it's
you didn't me peppermint or popsicle but
I really think it's gonna be peppermint
now yeah I do think peppermint is up
there peppermints up I think peppermints
like actually I like pancake the second
is popsicle this rumor started when
Google introduced their spring
wallpapers and one of them happen to
have a bunch of very Andy looking
popsicles on them possibly a red herring
possibly not I can't say for sure but
popsicle is definitely in consideration
I'm not convinced though because with
Android lollipop and now popsicle that
would be a lot of pop maybe their
marketing team just likes the word pop
but what do I know I like pancakes
yeah pancake is cool but it's not it's a
breakfast
I really think pepper man it's gonna be
entropy yeah as my vote right that's not
even my vote I will put money on it oh
hey well if you want to put money on it
let us know what you think we need me I
will bet you money okay well actually
make you money you'll bet you venmo yeah
yeah last up is peppermint the Android
pee Easter egg has a distinctive
peppermint tea color pattern to it it's
been a long long time since Google put
in Easter egg with actual clues to the
name so this too could be a misdirect
for the sake of prediction though I'm
gonna say that popsicle and peppermint
are both mr. X and I think that Google
is finally gonna go with a pie name so
if you want to tell us what you think
Android pee is going to be let us know
what you think in the comments down
below I don't think we're gonna have
much of a debate in the comments section
like we can't we can't really fight over
yeah cuz everyone's gonna agree with me
per minute like there's no other option
yeah for all things pepper which is not
good
