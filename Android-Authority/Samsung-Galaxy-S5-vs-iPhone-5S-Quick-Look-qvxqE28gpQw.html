by bitdefender mobile security it's the
battle of two very powerful flagship
devices from two very different camps a
in Strasbourg are from Android 30 what's
going on everybody and here we have a
quick look at the Samsung Galaxy s5
versus the Apple iPhone 5s now obviously
when it comes to design we have two very
different philosophies now on the one
hand we have the soft touch plastic and
the smooth curves of the galaxy s5 with
now a soft touch plastic back while on
the other hand we do have the iPhone 5s
that delivers a very premium feel
throughout its clean lines and it's
metal construction one phone delivers
massive screen real estate while the
other one is a compact build that
definitely is at home in pretty much any
pocket both phones feature physical home
buttons that integrate fingerprint
scanners this time as Samsung has added
a swipe based fingerprint scanner
underneath its home button you'll have
to slide your finger across as compared
to Apple's implementation in which you
can just press onto the home button
depending on what you really want out of
your screen the battle here might seem a
little bit one-sided it's very hard to
compare two screens when there is a 1.1
inch difference between them and the
result is a much larger surface for it
obviously the Galaxy s5 the iPhone 5s is
screen has been praised for its accurate
color production and for its great
display quality but in the other corner
of the galaxy s5 does have a higher
pixel density is larger in general for
media consumption and has the vivid
colors and lush blacks that really make
Super AMOLED screens some of the
favorites when it comes to the
performance we are dealing with two
different philosophies once again iOS is
known for its fluid animation and
impressive optimization especially in
the iOS 7 that was introduced in the 5s
it does sail through most of its tasks
but the processor found inside of the
iPhone 5s also has 64-bit processing
built in now contrast this to the galaxy
s5 which sports Snapdragon processing
that clocks in at 2.5 gigahertz now this
is a huge increase compared to previous
models and also since it is a quad-core
processor its philosophy is obviously
different from the processor found in
the iPhone 5s well in either case you
are definitely going to get the speed
you need now when it comes to the
hardware Samsung really trying to put
everything
into their new galaxy device definitely
gives it the lead by a bit of a margin
because it just has a much bigger number
of features compared to the iPhone 5s it
has everything from NFC to a micro SD
card slot and a removable battery but
also a one feature that was very
interestingly included onto the s5 was a
heart rate monitor on the back in which
you can check your heart rate by laying
your finger on top of the area the
somewhat more limited iPhone does
include a fingerprint scanner so that's
where they have a similarity here but to
be honest the polished experience of the
iPhone does lack the sheer number of
features that Samsung is put into the
newest flagship we might see a very
close call when it comes to the camera
department now despite the fact that the
Samsung Galaxy s5 features a lot more
inside of its app compared to the more
limited version of the iPhone camera app
we will see that the quality might
actually be on par between both the 16
megapixel ISO cell sensor found in the
s5 should give the excellent iPhone
camera I'll run for its money because it
supports great power with a lot of those
settings made to get truly the most out
of your smartphone photography iOS did
receive its big revamp last year and it
did move to a flatter brighter and more
abstract interface it still was a
somehow simplistic but still very fast
operating system and a lot of iPhone
users really stand by the reliability of
their iOS Samsung's UI has gone through
its own transformation on the galaxy s5
but it may not be quite as drastic
comparatively yes there were some
changes to some of the elements but
overall TouchWiz still pretty much looks
the same there is some new multitasking
available with that recent apps button
and the magazine the my magazine UI
rather is now a second screen all the
way on the left of your home screens the
only problem here is that while TouchWiz
still remains pretty speedy and pretty
fast and reliable it pretty much still
looks the same and if we were looking
for an update to it we may not have
gotten to here on the s5 and so there
you have it for the two flagship phones
that really represent their companies
very well on the one hand we do have a
phone that is a little bit more
accessible due to its size but also has
a pretty polished experience but then in
the other corner we have the Galaxy s5
which is a feature heavy phone that
provides a lot of different options for
how you want your smartphone
perience to be we have a lot more coming
on the Samsung Galaxy s5 so make sure
you stay tuned to android authority as
we report it all to you from the Mobile
World Congress here in Barcelona Spain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
