authority and yep this is it one plus
five T now if you've been following
oneplus for the last couple years you
know they tend to release two phones
every single year one comes out about
halfway through the year as a numerical
upgrade and the other one comes out near
the end which takes the same phone and
makes it a little bit better we saw this
last year with the three T which
upgraded the SOC the battery in the
front-facing camera but also shifted the
price up by 40 bucks
this year we've got the five t and if
you were expecting a major spec bump
you're not gonna get that here the
inside of the phone is pretty much the
same as the one plus five save a few
minor tweaks of the cameras it's still
got the Snapdragon 835 it's still got
six to eight gigs of ram and it still
got 64 to 128 gigs of storage
well this phone does differently though
is pretty obvious yeah it's the sweet
it's got that new 18 by 9 aspect ratio
which keeps it up with the new phones on
the market but the panel is still
basically the same it's still a 1080p
Samsung AMOLED panel it's just a little
bit bigger the better capacity is the
same two with 3300 milliamp hours of the
juice + 1 + says you're gonna get the
same battery life out of it but I'm
remaining pretty skeptical for now the
screen is filling a lot more space on
the front of the phone so oneplus
decided to move the fingerprint reader
to the back now if you like the
fingerprint reader in the front you're
gonna have to get used to it in the back
those probably won't be coming back
until they can figure out how to read
your fingerprint in the screen on the
bright side though oneplus wanted to
stress how fast this thing actually is
figure your hands on with the phone
oneplus mention that the reader should
unlock the phone within a fifth of a
second but of course that's something
we're gonna have to look at in our full
review if you don't like unlocking your
phone with your fingers oneplus actually
added a new face unlock feature so
saying this can unlock your phone from
up to a 45 degree angle I'm pretty
hesitant to see how secure this actually
is but it was really really fast during
our time with the device so it's always
convenient to have at least
the camera on the 5t is also a little
bit different the dual cameras are still
there with a little extra bump but the
telephoto lens is gone instead the 5t is
packing a 20 megapixel F 1.7 sensor
which uses their intelligent pixel
technology from the three T's
front-facing camera to apparently do
better in low-light circumstances they
said they swapped these out because
users didn't really notice the
difference between hardware and software
zoom but I'm not really buying that
you're gonna have to decide if the
better low-light performance is a worth
the omission of that 2 X optical zoom
the 5 T is gonna be 499 bucks for the
base model and 559 for the SPECT out
version so there is a $20 price bump
here if you're waiting for the oneplus 5
to come back in stock there's really no
reason not to go with the 5 T but if you
were thinking of upgrading your 1 + 5
you're probably gonna want to save your
money unless you've got to have that
screen overall and I'm paraphrasing Josh
here the 1 + 5 T is same same but
different so that's been it for our
hands-on if you liked the video tap the
like button and follow us on social
media and stay tuned for the full review
and other news the minute it hits
because of course we are your source for
