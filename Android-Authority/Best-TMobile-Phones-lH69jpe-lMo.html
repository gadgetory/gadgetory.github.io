know what your best Android options are
and for that I'm your huckleberry
and at the top of the list has got to be
Samsung's flagship the Galaxy s8 and si+
this time around they included a unique
18:59 aspect ratio that allows for a
much more comfortable in hand feel the
company even ditched its famous physical
a home button and included an on-screen
navigation under the hood these devices
come with Qualcomm Snapdragon 835
processor or the Exynos 88-90 5
depending on the region of which you
live 4 gigabytes of RAM 64 gigabytes of
on-board storage and one of the latest
versions of Android 7.0 nougat Samsung
also launched a few extra accessories
alongside the s8 that you should
definitely consider checking out the new
Samsung Dex doc that lets you use your
s8 as a desktop computer and there's
also the new gear 360 camera that allows
for shooting video in 4k and
live-streaming to YouTube of course
there's also the new Galaxy S a
compatible gear VR headset complete with
a controller for easier navigation now
when it comes to the LG G 6 the most
standout feature is the 5.7 inch quad HD
display with its interesting aspect
ratio of 89 and rounded corners it also
comes with a Snapdragon 820 1 processor
4 gigabytes of RAM plenty of on-board
storage and an ip68 rating for dust and
water resistance and dual 13 megapixel
rear cameras it's also worth noting that
not all LG sixes are created equal for
example the g6 that's coming to the u.s.
is the only variant that supports
wireless charging while the high 5 DAC
is exclusive to South Korea and certain
markets in Asia
what's more the g6 with 64 gigabytes of
storage is only available in a handful
of markets but the LG G 6 isn't a phone
full of gimmicky features that you'll
never use it's a solid phone that is
respected among geeks now I know the LG
v 30 has just recently come out but
until we're absolutely firm on all the
details on that device we got to tell
you that the LG v 20 is still one of the
best options if you are a Timo blur
LGV 20 has a big quad HD display
Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor plenty
of RAM and onboard storage dual 16
megapixel rear facing cameras and a
removable 3200 milliamp hour battery and
of course the unique 2nd screen makes a
return along with the addition of quad
DAC military standard durability and
it's also running Android 7.0 nougat now
although the next two devices have sort
of left the Nexus heritage to the
wayside in this list I do have to add
the pixel and pixel XL under the hood
these devices sports some decent specs
both devices have AMOLED displays
Snapdragon 820 1 processors 4 gigabytes
of RAM plenty of on-board storage and
long lasting batteries the overall
design however may not be your choice
and it may not be the most unique but
they do feel like premium phones through
and through now there may be a couple
things that will turn some of you away
for example they only have an IP 53
rating for dust and water resistance
meaning that they're not as waterproof
as some of the competition plus the
devices aren't known to be the most
durable ever so if you are prone to
being butterfingers you may want to get
a good quality case for your phone now
if you don't like any of those options
it's ok go get an iPhone there's no
judgement what do you want when you want
now my audience is smart so smart that
sometimes you're inspired by a business
idea and then you try and get the name
of that business in a domain name and
your next perspective customer is
searching your business name and they
assume you have the dot-com and if you
don't you're giving your business away
to the one who does that's the power of
accom now why is that exactly
well no domain name extension tells your
story with the same degree of trust as a
dot-com or dotnet domain name.com and
dotnet domain name extensions and jet
credibility and your online presence and
who doesn't want to be credible and
don't forget you get 15% off when you
use our coupon code Android when you
think domain names think domain.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
