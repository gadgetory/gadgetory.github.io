the LG g3 vs. dg2 with the LG g3 LG
continues on the path opened with the
predecessor with the marquee features
introduced on the g2 making a return on
the new generation we're talking of
course about the thin bezels on the
front and the rear mounted buttons just
like the g2 the g3 has a very high
streets of footprint ratio which makes
for an almost futuristic look but when
it comes to the size the g3 is
definitely larger but only slightly
heavier than the g2 and we have to keep
in mind that LG increased the screen
size by a full point three inches for
the g3 overall LG put those thin margins
to good use and delivered a 5.5 inch
device that's noticeably smaller than
other devices with the screen size and
is probably one of the best handling
ones out there the biggest change in
design between the two generations is
the now the brushed plastic pattern of
the g3 it is plastic but it has been
given a brushed treatment so it's not
really metal but it kind of feels like a
brushed metal back but it still looks
quite convincing and lends itself to a
nice feel
LG calls this a metallic skin and it's
supposed to be scratch resistant and to
offer protection against fingerprint
smudges overall the g3 will be available
in five colors black white gold violet
and burgundy red as mentioned earlier LG
increased the display size from 5.2 to
5.5 inches on the g3 wall plumping up
that resolution to an amazing quad HD it
was already very hard to see pixels on
the full HD g2 but it may be downright
impossible to discern them on this
weight that has a pixel density of over
500 PPI while there were other devices
with quad HD panels before already
the g3 will be the first that generally
available around the world which is a
great achievement for LG overall it's
beautiful dense bright panel that will
give any device out there a run for its
money and despite rumours to the
contrary the g3 comes with the quad core
Snapdragon 801 processor and 2 gigabytes
of RAM just like its main competitors
the Galaxy s5 and the m8 with the speed
of modern SOC s you probably won't miss
the upgraded processor though a
Snapdragon 805 would have helped the
high intensity games end for some future
proofing the g2 on the other hand is
quite similar in terms of its
performance sporting the Snapdragon 800
clocked in a 2.3 gigahertz with the same
2 gigabytes of RAM
in hardware the g3 doesn't have the
bells and whistles of other flagships
but it's still rich in features and you
won't really miss anything essential LG
improved its game compared to the g2
bringing two features that were sorely
missed are removable through a thousand
milliamp hour battery and a micro SD
card slot both accessible in that
removable back cover both phones feature
of 3000 milliamp hour battery but the
big question is how much power will that
quad HD screen draw theoretically the g3
should offer shorter battery life
compared to his predecessor but LG said
it optimized both the hardware and
software to enable the g3 to keep up
with its power thirsty display the LG g3
features a camera setup that's quite
similar to what was found on its
predecessor with a 13 megapixel rear
shooter with OIS + OS + was already seen
in the G pro 2 and we deemed it a very
good performer now while the sensor is
similar to the g2 s according to LG has
been optimized for even better results
the big addition on the g3 is the laser
autofocus system which should help
shorten the focusing times even in less
than ideal lighting situations this
laser is emitted from the little window
placed on the back of the device near
the camera overall I did see that the
auto focusing times were vastly
shortened at least compared to the LG g2
which had a really slow focusing time LG
has revamped the user interface on the
g3 making it simpler smoother and more
modern it's a step away from the eye
candy heavy interface of the past though
overall it's unmistakably LG the
geometric icons are a nice touch opting
for more circles all around and the
revamped notifications drop-down is a
great improvement over the ones of the
past that said LG still packs a ton of
features into its software with a lot of
new useful features as well new
additions include LG's own version
called Smart notice of a Google now like
interface which attempts to be a Virtual
Assistants the feature recommends an
umbrella for example if weather may be
rainy or remind you to call someone back
if you missed a call we'll need more
hands-on time to see how it how it is
but it's good to see how would you try
and to make meaningful improvements to
its software and if you buy a quick
circle smart cover you'll get to use the
phone through its circular window you
get to put several apps in the circular
interface for quick access and
developers will be able to add their own
using LG's SDK and so there you have it
for this quick look at the LG g3 and its
predecessor the g2 this is a vast
improvement all around from the
to the one that we have now and it's
gonna be pretty a pretty compelling
device especially with that larger
display but still LG's quintessential
style so keep it tuned here to Android
