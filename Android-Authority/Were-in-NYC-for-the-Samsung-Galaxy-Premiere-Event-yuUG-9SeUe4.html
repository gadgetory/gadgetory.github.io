it what's going out of the body and as
you can see behind me it's Madison
Square Garden I'm here in New York City
in the heart of Manhattan to bring you
coverage of the new Samsung Galaxy Tab
premiere event now we know for certain
that we're going to be seeing some new
tablets here at the event and what makes
these tablets special well it's the fact
that they are going to come with AMOLED
screen technology on and that's kind of
a big deal because amyloids have not
been seen on tablets in a long time and
they all pretty much only seen on the
samsung galaxy s phones there's actually
advertisement right over there for the
galaxy s5 and all of those smartphones
have the great AMOLED technology with a
high saturation that we're now going to
see on the Samsung Galaxy Tab tablets
essentially what we're doing is we're
taking the screen that you would have on
this smartphone right here and we're
blowing it up to at least eight inches
or even more right now there are a lot
of people walking around the madison
square garden area trying to find a way
to get in so they can get their new york
rangers merchandise but it looks like
the buzz is going to be around and the
galaxy tab premiere event is going to be
in a theater here at Madison Square
Garden so it's gloomy it's rainy here in
New York City but that doesn't mean we
aren't going to be here for the coverage
and as the advertisement said we're
going to tab into color and if today is
any indication New York can certainly
use a little bit because of this cloud
coverage so let us know what you think
about the upcoming events and once the
event is actually covered you'll see all
of my videos with the hands-on on all of
the different tablets and you can let me
know what you think in the comments
below but for now show us your
excitement drop some comments down below
