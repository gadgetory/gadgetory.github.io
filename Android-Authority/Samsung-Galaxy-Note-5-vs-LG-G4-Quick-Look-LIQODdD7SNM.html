this the samsung galaxy note5 versus the
LG g4 this year really marks the
Renaissance and samsung's design prowess
because the galaxy s6 started a trend
that the note 5 is only following now in
comparison LG's design has remained
pretty much similar and the g4 has the
same design features as its predecessor
the LG g3 - a subtle curve the two
handsets couldn't be more stark on the
design front as a result as Samsung has
opted for a metal and glass finish but
the large display and a fingerprint
reader built into the home button
underneath the screen in comparison the
front of the g4 is mostly dominated by
the screen with the handset using on
screen controls and the button layout
coming up on the back of the device now
when talking about specific design
features certain things do stand out
like the galaxy s flagship earlier this
year the note 5 doesn't have a removable
back cover or expandable storage and LG
helps to capture users who need those
features by offering them in the g4 and
like I already mentioned the LG g4 has
its volume and power keys on the back
beneath the camera and in comparison
Samsung has opted for their general
traditional approach by putting the
power button on the right with the
volume keys on the left and at the
bottom both handsets include a
microphone microUSB port and speaker
grilles but of course on the note 5 you
have the addition of the s-pen which has
been made a little bit lighter and even
easier to use than before including a
clicky top on the very top of the pen
which snaps into place when you put the
pen away in the bottom right now the
battle for display prowess has always
been one that LG and Samsung have done
and LG has opted to offer a display
measuring 5.5 inches in its G flagship
while Samsung has offered two different
devices the Galaxy s6 has the smaller
5.1 inch screen while at this the note 5
has the larger 5.7 inch display both
handsets offer a quad HD displays but
this is where the comparisons end the g4
uses an IPS panel with what is called
quantum display technology offering 98%
of the DCI color gamut which is the
standard used by Hollywood at 98% LG
claims that the g4 offers the full
spectrum of visible color and
theoretically the accurate type compared
to the higher saturation Super AMOLED
screens of these Samsung devices and of
course in comparison the note 5 has a
Super AMOLED panel that comes in with
the same sharpness vibrance
saturation that was found on the galaxy
s6 so images should tend to appear very
vibrant because of the super amoled
construction underneath the surface the
note 5 continues the new trend by
Samsung where their flagship devices
will be powered by in-house Exynos
processors which tend to be very
powerful and in comparison LG has worked
closely with Qualcomm to optimize the
Snapdragon 808 for the GeForce use in
both cases we have found that
performance is usually really great that
the s6 is any indication the note 5 will
fly through everything even with the
additions of the s-pen and the same goes
for the Snapdragon 808 in the LG g4 as
we've had few problems getting it done
through the daily in our g4 review the
ADA Way proved to be heavily optimized
for the g4 and it's going to be
interesting to see how comparison note 5
in our full comparison but in comparison
the g4 does have only three gigabytes of
RAM while Samsung made sure to put 4 in
both of their new Galaxy devices now the
biggest difference between the two
devices is obviously Samsung's decision
to remove the memory card slot and the
removable battery from the note 5 just
like it did with a galaxy s6 and that
being said the new note does come with a
big 3000 milliamp hour battery units
just like the g4 and it'll be
interesting to see which one delivers
better battery life but the key
difference is that in the g4 you will be
able to add not only expandable storage
but be able to use spares for the
battery if you happen to run out of
juice which does bring us to the cameras
which is one area where LG rapidly
approved from the g3 to the g4 with the
handsets sporting an all new 16
megapixel camera with laser autofocus
optical image stabilization a color
spectrum sensor and an even faster
aperture setting vens found in the
galaxy s6 but the galaxy s6 had one of
the best smartphone cameras on the
market
samsung aims to follow suit with the
note 5 which has the same rear shooter
and now a 5 megapixel front-facing
camera for even better self-portraits
now on that front LG the LG g4 has a 8
megapixel shooter that takes some pretty
good selfies on its own as well we are
going to put these two cameras through
their paces with a camera shootout to
see which Samsung or LG have done the
right things with their camera setups
and finally in software one of the
biggest changes for either of these
devices is the fact that their software
has been optimized for the processing
packages so speed should really be no
problem but the biggest change
in the Galaxy S range as Samsung decided
to strip back its TouchWiz interface and
as a results we had one of the best
experiences with Samsung software that
we think we've ever had we're really
happy that Samsung opted for a similar
philosophy in the note 5 toning back
even the s-pen which is where its
additions are mainly found mostly with
the s-pen you'll have the ability to
write a memo even when the phone is
locked you'll be able to pull the pen
out and use a screen off memo to quickly
make a note and then a couple of
enhancements to the air command menu
have allowed for a few different
applications that you frequently use
there along with some capabilities that
are added into already available
features we found in the note 4 and now
LG made some changes to its interface
this year but the G UX still is a little
bloated with a ray of features that
don't necessarily need to be on the
handset LG's operating system tends to
really get in your face about all of the
different features that it has and with
a slightly bloated operating system and
interface it can seem a little bit
overwhelming even on a larger and quad
HD display but both smartphones will run
the latest version of lollipop and the
key difference will be in the interfaces
but luckily optimization and performance
are not going to be that different
between these two so what the note 5 you
do get the s-pen and all that it
provides but otherwise it's version of
Android is still pretty similar to what
we have seen in the past especially in
the galaxy s6 and so there you have it a
quick comparison between the samsung
galaxy note 5 and one of its biggest
challengers in the form of the LG g4 the
note 5 is set to launch in the coming
weeks while the g4 is already widely
available so really it comes down to
what you want to find in your particular
smartphone if you really do want to use
the s-pen then obviously the note 5 is
the obvious choice if a little bit of
extra durability due to the curve of the
LG g4 is something that you want along
with its leather backings then the g4 is
probably the one that you would want but
it comes down to your personal taste and
you can wait here at Android Authority

coverage of the note 5 that you can find
