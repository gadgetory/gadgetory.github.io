we've been hearing a lot of praise for
the lg optimus G and it's processing
hardware but we wanted to see if it
really packed the same byte as its park
we pitted the Snapdragon s4 pro against
the Samsung Galaxy s3 sexy nose 4412
processor to see which one has the
sharpest bite the Qualcomm Snapdragon s4
pro chipset consists of the 1.5
gigahertz quad-core Krait CPU and the
Adreno 320 GPU the Samsung Exynos 4412
chipset on the other hand consists of
the 1.4 gigahertz quad-core ARM Cortex
a9 CPU and the arm mali 400 MP for GPU
let's take these two babies for a series
of benchmark tests and see which one is
the best let's start with the first set
of multi-purpose benchmark tests first
off we will be performing the quadrant
benchmarking test on both phones this
test will measure the CPU input and
output in 3d display performance let's
see how the Snapdragon and Exynos will
do in this round whoa the Snapdragon s4
pro is practically breathing fire with a
score of 6,200 42 against the AXI nose
4412 5461
next let's run the antutu benchmark on
both phones this one measures the
overall performance of a device's
processor memory CPU integer performance
CPU floating-point 2d and 3d performance
SD card reading and writing speed and
database input and output performance as
you can see the Snapdragon s4 pro still
defense its number one spot with a score
of eleven thousand two hundred forty
eight the X Ino is 4412 processor gave a
good fight for the score of ten thousand
two hundred thirty nine the Snapdragon
s4 pro is still sitting in the number
one spot let's see if the CF bench
benchmark will yield the same results
this benchmark is specifically designed
to measure the CPU and memory
performance of multi-core devices let's
find out there the Snapdragon s4 pro is
still on the top of the score
14300 2040 412 processor acquired only
13224 for the next benchmark test we use
the Vellamo mobile benchmark to test the
phones html5 and cpu performance the
lambo mobile benchmark html5 measures
the performance of the phone's web
browser let's see how each phone fares
the galaxy s3 acquired a good score of
1417 the optimus g performed even better
with a score of 1535 now let's run
Vellamo mobile benchmark metal to
measure the cpu performance of these
mobile processors let's see the results
the Samsung Exynos 4412 processor
finally beats the Snapdragon s4 pro with
a score of 557 over 543 it was quite a
close fight we just finished the first
round of our benchmark tests so far the
Samsung Exynos 4412 scored higher than
the Snapdragon s4 pro in the Vellamo
mobile benchmark metal but the
Snapdragon s4 pro dominated in the
quadrant benchmark and - to benchmark CF
bench bench mark and Vellamo mobile
benchmark html5 tests now that we're
done with measuring the overall system
performance let's now move on to a more
specific part the CPU the next series of
benchmarks will measure how fast the 1.5
gigahertz quad-core Krait processor at
the Snapdragon s4 pro and the 1.4
gigahertz quad-core cortex a9 of the
Exynos 4412
perform we used Geekbench 2 to measure
CPU and memory performance let's see how
both processors fare the Snapdragon s4
pro processor acquired a score of 1681
the Exynos acquired a lower score of
1489 to measure CPU computing speed we
used the Linpack for Android this
benchmark measures how fast a CPU salts
a dense and by end system
linear equations ax equals b which is a
common task in engineering results are
represented in millions of
floating-point operations per second
also known as mega flops for M flops the
higher the M flops score the better the
rating we perform two tests single
thread and multi thread for the single
thread test the Exynos 4412 got a rating
of 54 point nine three seven M flops the
Snapdragon wins this test with a score
of 194 point zero five nine and flops
let's now see if the multi thread test
will yield the same results the
Snapdragon still beats XE notes with a
rating of 460 point eight three eight
and flops against 121 point two five six
and flops from the Samsung processor as
you can see in the second round of our
benchmark tests the Snapdragon s4 pro
got better scores than the Samsung
Exynos 44 12 and all four tests two
rounds down and two more to go next up
is the graphic processors benchmark
round these benchmarks provide us some
idea about which device has better
graphics and display performance let's
begin this round with GL benchmark 2.5
Egypt HD C 24 Z 16 both on screen and
off screen tests for the GL benchmark on
screen test the Snapdragon s4 approach
negative score of 28 frames per second
over the Exynos 44 12 15 frames per
second for the off screen test the
Snapdragon s4 pro got the top spot again
with 20 frames per second over the
Exynos 44 12 15 frames per second the
nano mark one test was a tie for both
processors as they both scored 60 frames
per second it was a very close battle in
the nano mark to test with the Samsung
Exynos 4412 scoring 50 8.8 FPS just 0.1
FPS higher than the Snapdragon s4 post
58.7 fps in the last test of this round
the an 3d bench
I'll benchmark the Snapdragon s4 pro
tops the Exynos 4412 again with a score
of thirty-five thousand five hundred
four over the Samsung chip score of
thirty four thousand three hundred
thirty four now it's time for the
browser benchmark set of tests the
fourth round of this processor brawl
first up is the SunSpider for JavaScript
test which measures the core JavaScript
language ability of the device for this
test lower is better and the Snapdragon
s4 pro certainly scored lower with 1600
6.0 milliseconds the Samsung Exynos 4412
only got 2000 36.8 milliseconds the
right where browse Mart test is up next
this test measures overall browser
performance the Samsung Exynos 4412 is
not going down without a fight and comes
in with 168,000 448 compared to the
Snapdragon s4 pro score of 80 9018 last
but not the least we pitted these two
processors against each other in the
Google v8 benchmark sweet bigger is
better in this test the Exynos 4412 got
a score of 1744 while the Snapdragon s4
pro got 1129 and the three browser
benchmark tests the Samsung Exynos 4412
scored higher in both the right web as
Mark and the Google v8 benchmark suite
tests while the Snapdragon s4 pro won
and the sent spider for JavaScript tests
as you can see the Snapdragon s4 pro
lorded over the majority of the
benchmark tests Qualcomm certainly
created a beast
the Samsung Exynos 4412 on the other
hand did not fare poorly in the tests at
all but it's also worth remembering that
the galaxy s3 came out earlier than the
optimus G what do you think of these
results guys do these play you into
choosing the lg optimus G as your next
Android phone leave your comments and
