what's going on everybody
and as you can see behind me on my
lovely TV monitor right here I have the
chromecast installed currently ready for
some streaming goodness
now the chromecast as you probably have
seen on Android authority comm has been
given a pretty substantial update not
only are there are a couple little
nuances that have been updated in the
chromecast itself but now it supports 10
whole new applications to even further
open up all of the functionality that is
available not only are a couple music
apps put in there there are also a
couple of applications that allow you
for somewhat of a local streaming
experience while there isn't an actual
way for you to stream stuff from your
computer or from your device straight to
the chromecast still there are a couple
of extra pads kind of loopholes if you
will that allow you to do so and we're
going to take a look at those apps right
now well actually first I did want to
bring your attention to the new
backgrounds that are available in the
new chromecast updates there are
actually all photos of various locales
throughout the world at least that's
what it looks like and they're all
really really nice but it still keeps
the chromecast interface really
minimalistic when you're not streaming
anything to it alright so let's take a
look at the actual applications I have
my phone setup right over here and
you'll be able to see what applications
I'm going to use on top of what kind of
functionality they provide we'll start
off with a couple of simple ones let's
start off with Pandora and I already
have it queued up right here and if you
look on the TV here I'll just make sure
it is Chrome casting and it'll change to
Pandora of course pretty much making it
a nice music player will go and turn it
up here and you can enjoy this song real
quick
alright so that was Pandora and we'll
move right on to VEVO which is of course
the huge collection of music videos from
pretty much every artist on YouTube and
now that we're in here let's just go to
artists as you can see there's just an
absolute ton of people here you can't go
wrong with some JT
let's go from mirrors let's go ahead and
head over to a lovely one revision3 of
course Android authority is a part of
the revision3 family so I would be
remiss if I did not showcase a couple of
things here so let's find our show
let's head all the way oops apparently I
don't know the alphabet there we go
and cast that chrome there's a nice
Android Weekly right here for you
welcome back to Android Weekly my name
is Jace and this is where we cover the
weeks and right news and five insights
what it means for you the Android lover
okay here comes a bit of an interesting
one it's called Vikki I have certainly a
lot of friends who love their Korean
dramas Asian shows and whatnot so Vikki
is just a portal into that a lot of
really free content on here which is
very interesting everything from a bunch
of different Korean dramas to Chinese
shows to japanese shows to music videos
from asia across the world even
venezuela as you saw there taiwan just a
ton so if i was going to just select one
of the TV shows this is one of the top
ones apparently okay add to stop I have
to stop I'm sorry just Korean dramas
ma'am just say okay now the one that I
was really excited to show you was the
plex media server and essentially I have
a friend who's plex server I use
constantly just has a very nice
collection of TV shows and movies
unfortunately the problem that I had
here was obviously it's not my server
well this is what happens let's see if I
wanted to jump into season 3 of Breaking
Bad wonderful show by the way good lord
let's go ahead and jump into that
episode cast it to there and we'll see
Plex over here it says it's ready to
cast however if I press play and it
tries to cast to it unfortunately you
need to have a very updated version of
the plex media server installed and
unfortunately my buddy doesn't have that
so I can't show you the plex media
server right now going to the chromecast
but as you can see there it is trying to
play that is Breaking Bad right there
that is trying to play to the chromecast
it's just the media servers not updated
so if you have Plex and you really want
to use it for the chromecast make sure
you have your stuff update
well if Plex is not an option for you
then there are a couple of other ones
out there that you can use and
realplayer is one of them if you
remember real player from the olden days
they're still around and this time they
are using a cloud
this type of model in order to make
things happen now we're looking at the
videos in my library these three videos
right here I have I have a vlog of my
own one of Jacey's videos and one of
Joe's videos however deals are situated
on my computer they're actually not in
the real player cloud which gives you
two gigabytes from the start that you
can use across all devices however a
sync happens among all of the devices
and these videos on my computer can be
played on my phone as you can see right
here so this is actually playing
straight from my computer but with the
chromecast support I'm able to make my
phone the middleman to make the video on
my computer go to my TV it's actually
really cool and there's the real player
icon and in any minute now you'll see my
vlog on my TV like I said that is not
coming from the cloud or anything like
that I did not upload it to the real
player cloud this is coming from my
computer using my phone as the middleman
to create the stream to the chromecast
now that's that's a nice little loophole
and it works very well
oh those brokers were so good
and so there you have it for this quick
presentation on the new functions that
are available in the chromecast update
10 whole new applications I didn't even
get through all of them are available
for your chromecast for this wonderful
streaming goodness on top of all the
other ones you already have like Netflix
HBO GO and Google Play Music and Google
Play videos or movies and it just really
makes the chromecast even more of a
robust package I have to tell you even
though I constantly use my computer via
HDMI out to play stuff on my TV it is
really nice to just have your phone and
when you feel like you want to watch
something and it shows up right here
just hit the chromecast button and go
straight to your TV it is still at $35
one of the best packages available for
you to get streaming content to your TV
in a very easy way as always thank you
guys very much for watching and I hope

chromecast applications that have been
added into this most recent update well
