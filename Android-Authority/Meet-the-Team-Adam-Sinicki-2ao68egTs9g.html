game development is unity it makes the
whole process so much quicker and
simpler so much so that in this video
I'm going to show how you can get
something up and running in just yep
that's me so you're probably wondering
how I got here what it all started a few
years ago hey there guys thanks for
tuning in so I've been making videos
with under Authority for about a year
now but I still get comments on video
sometimes asking Who I am where I came
from who is this guy what does he know
who does he think he is
so I thought I'd take the time to
introduce myself and say hi so my name
is Adam schnitz ki it's very nice to
meet you that's a Polish name in case
you're wondering I'm half Polish quarter
German but born in England I currently
live near Oxford in a town called mr.
with my lovely wife Hannah we've lived
here about a year and prior to that we
were living in London before that I
lived in Bournemouth which is where I
was born and raised and I still visit
back there very often I also do a lot of
commuting into London it's a nice easy
trip from where I am now so most the
time you'll find me in coffee shops in
Oxford or London or Vista or you'll find
me in my office upstairs working for
agile Authority or working on one of my
many other projects when I'm not working
things I like include going to the gym
Electric Light Orchestra writing
programming computer games comic books
tuna sandwiches synth wave music
traveling when I get the opportunity to
seeing friends nobody your hobby is it
lamp love my Nintendo switch at the
moment technology in general gadgets
reading Dragonball 80s action movies
wrong psychology and neuroscience
nootropics calisthenics Alice Cooper m83
Schiller martial arts Wells do I like
there's probably loads of other stuff I
like but my main hobbies are definitely
Fitness and Technology and I'm quite
lucky in that I've managed to make those
things into my career so my interest in
technology goes a long way back probably
I was about six my first
buta was a ZX Spectrum I also had a
Tatem Einstein and I kind of missed
those days when technology was less
user-friendly when it was all green
screens and you were just greeted with a
prompt to enter basic code instead of
you know a nice touch friendly interface
I found it a lot more exciting that way
it was like this hidden world that other
people didn't necessarily understand I
love to Sonic the Hedgehog my friends
all had sega mega drives but I wasn't
allowed to play computer games so
instead I decided to start making my own
and with the help from a kid at school I
started to learn a little bit of basic
that I could use on my ZX spectrum to
that end eventually I was allowed a
proper laptop and I got a AST 486 and I
learned to programming qbasic on that
they also developed into a love of
gadgets and technology in general my
first phone was either the Nokia 3310 or
3210 but after that I got some more
exciting and interesting stuff I got the
Nokia ngage running Symbian which was
quite a cool thing back then
I was really into the ipact devices from
the likes of HP and I had one with a
stylus and an attachable keyboard and I
installed games like Tomb Raider on it
in many ways that was a smartphone
before smartphones my first actual
smartphone was when I was on placement
year at university and I got a iPhone
actually but then after that I got much
more interested in Android because it
had that whole hacker appeal of being
out the tinkerer and changed things
just like those old green screens back
in the day and the first Android device
I got was a Dell Streak and this was a
huge phablet I've always liked unusual
looking technology I hate the fact that
every phone looks the same today the
Dell Streak was a phablet before even
the first note meanwhile whilst I was
going through school and sick form I got
really into fitness I really wanted to
be an action hero or a superhero really
I never grew out of that likeness of
postie so I started bodybuilding in
inverted commas in my bedroom
curling little dumbbells doing lots of
press ups and I eventually one teen
bodybuilder of the week on
bodybuilding.com which was actually
quite a big deal at the time and I got
loads of fan mail and emails and that
led to me having my first a website
built for me for free and that was my
first foray into web design then as I
went into university I decided I wanted
to continue with that kind of
self-improvement angle so I took
psychology and also just because I
really enjoyed that
at sixth form whilst I was there I
carried on working on websites I had a
friend who was very into internet
marketing and he taught me how he could
monetize a website how you could place
ads on it a little bit about SEO so I
started to build that site make a little
bit money on the side and just
understand how that whole industry works
University was great that's where I met
many of my best friends to this day it's
where I met my wife she wasn't my wife
then and we also had this thing where
you take a year out into a placement
year experience the real world get a job
before coming back to finish your degree
so I did a year working in Leeds at
writers news so I got some experience as
a journalist I was also really into
writing at the time and I loved that and
then I came back and graduated during my
final year like most students I was
struggling a little bit with money and I
decided I could try and earn a little
bit of extra cash on the side so I
already knew that I could make money
from a website although it wasn't really
earning that much and I knew how to
write now and I thought well if I can
make money from a website than other
people obviously camp - I'll write for
them and charge per words so I did that
I put an advert out online on a website
called digital point forum and then I
got some work and I started just writing
sending off articles that I've written
and getting paid per word for those and
the more I write the more I earned and
then when I left University I realized I
don't actually have to get a proper job
I can do this on a full-time basis so I
started just writing I moved out of my
mom's house and moved in with my mate
booth and I got to extend my kind of a
university experience because I could
write at any time of day again writing
in coffee shops I was living in
Bournemouth by the beach sitting in
cafes watching the world go by typing up
and then going out with friends visiting
my wife who wasn't my wife at the time
who lived near Oxford and I could just
live the lifestyle I wanted I got to
travel a little bit more working online
was great my main topics were fitness
and technology and that's what I got
paid to write the most but unfortunately
I also had to write an awful lot of
dross on topics had no idea about like
bricklaying and car windows and things
just for companies that needed Internet
content in order to get their site to
the top of Google so I wasn't really
enjoying that side of it and it was
ghost writing so it wasn't very
rewarding sobs I wanted to work on my
own project
on the side so one of those projects was
to developed my coding skills
I used a tool called basic for Android
or B for a to build an app for Android
called multi screen multitasking and the
idea of this app was to create a way
around the fact that at the time you
couldn't do split-screen between two
apps still remember being at a party and
I was checking sales of the app on my
phone and I suddenly saw them spike and
I realized they were climbing and
climbing and I got so excited it wasn't
great fun at this particles I just kept
checking them and thinking wow this idea
I've had has taken off and the world is
excited by it that party then turned a
little bit dark and weird but that's a
different story and escaping the
inspiration as well to work on other
apps and ideas so I learned Android
studio and Java how to create apps the
proper way not using basic and launched
a few more different projects some of
which were fairly successful some of
which weren't so successful and then my
big next idea was to work with the
YouTuber cold fusion who'd inspired me
when I first got into Android so I
approached him and said would you like
me to work on your boxers app and he
said let's go for it so he did the
design and had the idea and I just
handled the code and he was he's a
fantastic designer so the app looked
great it was the nicest guy and he has a
big audience already so the app was
again a little bit of a hit in while I
was also working on my own website cuz I
still want to talk about fitness and
training and performance and
neuroscience and I added the YouTube
component to that which wasn't a big hit
at all but it was just something I loved
doing and then I think that combination
of things attracted the attention of
Android Authority the fact that I'd made
an app that was quite successful the
fact that I've worked with ColdFusion
the fact I had a YouTube channel so they
got in touch and said would you like to
do some work for us so at the begin with
I just started writing articles for them
mainly development articles but then
eventually they said would you like to
make some YouTube videos as well would
you like to attend some events and I was
like yes please so that was awesome so
I've been working here with them for the
last year and it's been fantastic I got
to meet a lot of the team recently in
San Francisco and there's a nicest bunch
of guys they've helped my video skills a
lot as well as my writing and yes it's
been a fantastic experience I've loved
some other devices getting to play with
gadgets getting to write getting to make
youtube videos like this one so yeah
it's been it's been quite a ride and
I've been very lucky I've had a lot of
cool opportunities and I've somehow
managed to avoid doing any proper work
for coming up for eight nine years and I
still got loads of other products on the
go I recently had my first book
published on unity development making
games for Android I'm currently making
educational videos for a publishing
company I still run my own website and
blog and blog and in fact the YouTube
channel that I was talking about has
become fairly successful I'm reaching
17,000 ish subscribers there I talk
about fitness bodybuilding neuroscience

oyster and just if find what you love I
