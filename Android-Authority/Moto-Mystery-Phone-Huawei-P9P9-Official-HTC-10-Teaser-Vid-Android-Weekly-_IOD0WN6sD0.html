new moto last week we found a new blurry
can pick that appeared on hello moto
hk's google+ account which is seemingly
cited a prototype in the wild the post
contains the words moto infinity which
may be hyperbole or perhaps suggest a
new product line or rebranding now there
are three key takeaway points here one
the device has what looks to be a USB
type-c port on the bottom second the
device looks to have a fingerprint
sensor or some sort of fingerprint
sensor home button hybrid located near
the bottom bezel and the frame looks to
be metallic we'll see now in order to
understand the mysterious markings near
the top of the device we have to look at
the Moto G prototype from last year you
can see here the top left corner has the
OEMs infamous logo and the bottom has a
message about confidentiality the top
left corner has the OEMs infamous logo
and the bottom has a message about
confidentiality in today's blurry pic
the Motorola logo can be made out in the
upper left corner and the legal note is
placed just above the top bezel some may
be surprised if not put off entirely by
the potential placement of what looks to
be a fingerprint sensor this is all the
more valid giving that Motorola has made
it a point to include a dimple on the
back of its hardware for the past
several years with respect to the Nexus
6 in particular it was even stated by
former motorola CEO dennis woodside that
such a simple dimple was indeed
originally meant to house a biometric
reader though the feature was ultimately
scrapped the possible answer for such a
mystery can readily be found on a
current crop of alleged photos that have
been circulating the internet for some
months now the image here from a
December 2015 post was part of a rumor
that suggested that the new Moto X 2016
would be made of metal note the batwing
logo is clearly just an ordinary
insignia it appears neither dimpled nor
cut out where a biometric reader would
be placed so what to make of all of this
well let's just take a recap of what we
do know right from Motorola's mouse all
motorola branded devices launched in
2016 will come with some
sort of embedded fingerprint sensor we
also know that all products launched in
2016 will have screen sizes of 5 inches
or larger and they will continue their
customization effort and finally we also
know that Lenovo and motorola's you I
will be merged into one UI to be veiled
in 2017 now let's talk the huawei p 9 +
p9y which have been officially announced
now let's talk huawei at a launch event
in london last week huawei unveiled its
latest flagship smartphones the huawei p
9 + p9y alone the huawei p9 is clearly
targeted at the upper end of the market
the design isn't a massive departure
from last year's p8 but there's also
quite a nice resemblance to the
excellent nexus p as well the phone
comes in just at six point nine five
millimeters thick and has a bezel that
measures just one point seven
millimeters Huawei says that the phone
is constructed with a full metal unibody
and features curved edges for a
comfortable hold it's also hard to deny
that it's quite a good-looking device
when it comes to the display Huawei has
remained committed to its opinion that
above and beyond a 1080p resolution just
isn't worth the additional hit to the
battery life and personally I agree the
huawei p9 features a 5.2 inch display
with a 1920 x 1080 resolution resulting
in a very decent 423 pixels per inch as
such the handset is pretty much the same
size as last year's p8 now the p 9 plus
bumps this up to 5.5 inches for those
who want a slightly larger handset and
swaps out that LCD panel for an AMOLED
alternative Huawei boosts that its new
display is capable of 500 nits /
brightness and ninety-six percent of
color saturation and the company's press
touch display technology that debuted
with the maid s also makes a
reappearance in both models now you HTC
fans will be happy to know that HTC just
put it a new teaser boasting the best
camera ever in their upcoming HTC 10
this teaser is packed of what we presume
our sample shots taken from the new
smartphone along with plenty of pictures
of non smartphone cameras that HTC
engineers have been using for
inspiration keen-eyed watchers will also
be able to spot the reference
to a number of HTC 10 s camera
specifications at the 29 second mark
there's mention of an ultra pixel sensor
optical image stabilization and the high
res 4k video capture all which is very
impressive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
