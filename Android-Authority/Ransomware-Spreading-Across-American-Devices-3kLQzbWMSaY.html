brought to you by Full Sail University
now although malware has been around for
a long time and is a pain in the butt
for sure there is a special place in
hell for those who produce ransomware
and it's on the rise but first off let's
talk about what ransomware really is
this specific kind of malware aims to
take money from users by fooling them
into willingly paying certain amounts of
cash and in the most recent case that
would be 500 bucks which is a
significant amount of money it's also an
Android lockscreen Trojan which means it
can lock users out of their devices this
ESET discovered malware goes by the name
of Android locker pin and it's quite a
nasty bug after successful infection the
software were trying to fool you into
granting it device administrative rights
the trick here is that it does it in
very sneaky ways in this case the
administrator privilege page is overlaid
with a fake window that claims to be a
patch update of course in experienced
users may fall for this and press
Continue which would be very bad news
indeed the device is now infected and
this software has administrative rights
over your phone it can even change your
PIN number and lock you out of your
smart phone but it gets worse after some
time affected users will be presented
with a window containing a fake FBI
message that claims the user has been
viewing prohibited pornographic material
it also mentions he or she should pay a
$500 fine for being involved in these
quote criminal activities try to leave
this message and the screen will be
locked at this point the user cannot
install Android locker PIN but only by
doing so through safe mode or ADB but
you are out of luck once Ransom activity
has commenced as a randomly generated
pin number will be put in place and
successfully take away your access over
the phone now what to do well first of
all don't pay it not even the attacker
can unlock the phone at this point the
only way to recover access is to perform
a factory data reset sure this may be a
hassle to have to go through that whole
process but honestly this is what we
would recommend
if you were infected in any case the
crazy part is that the ransomware
even has some defense mechanisms built
in for example upon trying to disable
administrative rights for Android locker
pen the software will simply reactivate
it in addition this trojan also tries to
kill antivirus processes Wow now the
vast majority of you are not going to
have a problem with this because you're
only downloading apps from the Google
Play Store but if your sideloading apps
from some mysterious source that is a
risk now if you must download apps from
someplace other than the Google Play
Store make sure that source is trusted
and you should be fine
now when a curious note it turns out
that 77% of ransomware victims from this
particular ransomware
are from the US I thought it would be
the other way around so how many of you
have been affected by ransomware have
you been hit by this particular bug or
another I'd like to hear about in the
comments below let us know now if you
knew me for my XD developer TV days
you'd know that I interviewed hundreds
of successful software developers and
what became very painfully clear is that
there is a serious gap between the
theory that computer science engineering
students learn and the practical
knowledge needed to build a great app
and that's the problem that our beloved
sponsor Full Sail University is trying
to address the mobile development
bachelor's degree program offered on
campus and online teaches students how
to develop apps and utilities through
courses that cover both iOS and Android
development all students graduate with
multiple completed software products and
the web design and development
bachelor's degree program also offered
on campus and online teaches front-end
design and back-end development along
with coding formats programming
languages and more all students have
hands-on access to technology from day
one they receive a laptop computer at an
institutional discount along with
relevant software and tools to learn
more about full sales web and Technology
programs visit Full Sail edu forward
slash authority thanks for watching
Android army my name is Jase love to
connect with you right here on Google+
or Twitter you don't wanna forget about
my brothers and sister and Android who
are working super hard to viewer source
