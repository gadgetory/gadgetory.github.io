phones by catering to a budget-conscious
audience that doesn't want to compromise
too much in the specs of features
departments the honor 7 was a solid
entry in that respect managing to offer
decent features at an affordable price
and the honor a aims to build on this so
is newer better let's find out how the
honor 8 stacks up against the honor 7
undoubtedly the first thing that strikes
you about the honor 8 is its new glass
construction we got to play the sapphire
blue model or there also comes at
midnight black and pearl white the
shimmering design is made possible
thanks for 2.5 D glass technology and
that changing materials used is
definitely the biggest difference
between the two devices last year while
I was going through something of a metal
phase and the honest 7 firmly fit this
build the switch to glass this year does
mean it's a fingerprint magnet but as
we've seen with other glass back devices
this is common for a glass finish
otherwise the design language is pretty
similar with a fingerprint sensor around
the back no physical home button and
nice thin bezels it's slightly thinner
this time at 7.45 millimeters versus
eight point five millimeters but in all
other respects the dimensions are very
close indeed the fingerprint sensor
returns around the back embedded into a
physical button that similar to the
gestures on the end of sevens
fingerprint sensor allows you to program
several actions
these can include single taps double
taps and long presses meaning that
Pokemon go is never more than a button
press away you can also swipe through
images in your photo gallery with it on
the front the honor eight has an
attractive 5.2 inch screen which remains
the same as last time the resolution
also holds steady at 1920 x 1080 P so
there's no quad HD here yet that said
the screen has been given a little more
saturation and brightness to closer
resemble an AMOLED out of the box the
honor eight will come with android
marshmallow but this should be
upgradable to android n at some point in
the future once again you'll also get
while weighs emotion UI on top of that
which brings a couple of neat additions
but may not be to everyone's tastes
another nice software feature that's new
to the line is a blue light filter this
should help to keep your cortisol levels
low and melatonin levels high right
before bed just like the option found on
the Galaxy next seven as its par for the
course the honor eight features a slight
bump up in specs compared to the seven
insiders of huawei's own octa-core Kirin
950 processor which is an upgrade on the
Kirin 95 found in last year's model Ram
has also been increased from three
gigabytes to four kick
meaning there should be no performance
concerns with the on rate the honest
seven came with either 16 or 64
gigabytes of internal storage
this time we have one option bang in the
middle at 32 gigabytes both of
expandable by up to 128 gigabytes via
microSD card though the battery life
takes a small step down from the on 7
meanwhile going from three thousand one
hundred million power capacity to three
thousand milliamp power the eight also
promises low power consumption for its
GPS and comes with quick charging which
lets you charge the battery to 47% in
just 30 minutes something new that the
honor a brings to the table is a dual
camera like the one found on the wire a
p9 but without the lights your branding
that means that you have two lenses to
capture color and monochrome images
respectively the honor rate will then
combine these two images to form a final
more detailed product the camera app is
also very nice allowing you to adjust
the aperture both before and after
taking a shot the main camera is 12
megapixels while the selfie camera is 8
megapixels that rear camera is down from
20 megapixels in the honor rate then but
side-by-side comparisons confirm that
the 8 is still definitely a
significantly better shooter the honor 7
was a surprisingly solid phone for its
price and that's again what you're
getting with the honor 8 while the
increase in specs might be a little
marginal in some respects that's
starting to matter less and less these
days with this upgrade what you're
getting is a better camera and big
improvements in build quality and
aesthetics
however if none of these new features
appeal and you want the very lowest
price for your smartphone with no need
for the latest hardware then the honor 7
is still a fine choice
- so what do you think of the honor 8
