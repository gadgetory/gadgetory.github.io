Android Authority and today we'll be
checking out the first affordable
smartphone with an 18 by 9 display so
this is the LG q6 you can think of it as
a g6 mini as it takes much of what we
love about the flagship g6 and puts it
in a slightly smaller more affordable
package the most exciting aspect of the
q6 is undoubtedly the display I mean
just look at it
LG's full vision technology makes for
minimal bezels on each side of the
display until now displays with 18 by 9
aspect ratios and curved corners were
reserved for much more expensive models
the q6 display isn't just a winner and
looks to as it makes the phone more
compact and thus easier to hold the 5.5
inch 1080p IPS panel is a small step
down from the G sixes by 0.7 inches but
it's just enough to make the q6 organ
amak while still having a large display
you're really getting the best of both
worlds here the display itself is better
than we expected to contrast color
reproduction and saturation are all
great sunlight readability isn't the
best but it's about as good as you're
going to get unless you spend more you
won't have to spend more for a nice
design though at least not with the q6
the q6 shares many premium design
elements with the g6 including a metal
frame glossy back and solid build
quality that doesn't mean that there
aren't any compromises though this time
around the glossy back is plastic
instead of glass plastic has some
advantages but here it scratches
unbelievably easily this isn't a huge
deal though is you can always just by a
third party case a more significant
compromise is the lack of the
fingerprint reader when pretty much
every other phone has a fingerprint
reader even at this price we have to
question LG's judgment the supposin
substitute to this is face recognition
but it's sadly doesn't work well in
practice
the future stops working when you're in
a dark room recently shaved your face or
even styled your hair differently you
can get the q6 unlocked in either single
or dual sim variants either way you'll
get a microSD card slot in case the
phone's built-in 32 gigabytes isn't
enough LG chose to place the q6 of
speaker on the back a somewhat odd
choice given the size
position on the g6 the speaker sounds
really distorted too so you want to
stick to headphones also not Lots though
as there is still a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack so you won't have to mess
around with dongles strangely the q6
uses microUSB instead of USB type-c a
reversible standard that has been around
for two years now that made it difficult
for us to use the q6 day to day since we
fully transitioned to the new standard
those who haven't though might
appreciate this well LG is an
advertising fast charging on the q6 we
were able to charge from zero to 50
percent in 45 minutes since our review
unit does not support 4G LTE in the US
we had to conduct our battery life test
on 3G which likely inflated the results
still you can expect about four hours of
screen on time with a full day of
moderate use that's pretty good but not
all that surprising given that it's
using a low end power efficient Qualcomm
Snapdragon 435 the 435 is pretty low-end
but hey it's better than some mediatek
chips out there
combined with three gigabytes of RAM the
LG q6 is still a very capable performer
day to day you probably won't notice
it's slightly slower performance unless
you compare it directly to a more
expensive phone you will notice a
difference with a 13 megapixel app 2.2
rear camera though as the saying goes
you get what you pay for one of the main
issues we experience is the camera
slower speed to capture images this
caused some serious motion blur and some
of our sample shots if you manage to
keep a very steady hand during the
capture though you can get some decent
looking images color reproduction is
very good and there's a good level of
detail dynamic range could be better but
it's no worse than competing options if
you're just snapping the occasional pic
for social media this camera will be
just fine with that said if you take a
lot of important photos you may want to
consider spending a bit more for
something better the camera really
struggles in low-light as is typical at
this price there's a bunch of digital
noise and color reproduction takes a
considerable hit you can record videos
at up to 1080p but video quality is not
very good so please don't turn out very
well either frankly the 5 megapixel F
2.2 front-facing camera produces blurry
and poorly colored shots
moving on to software the LG q6 ships
with Android 7 point
1.1 Newgate with LG's UX 6.0 layered on
top so you're getting the same exact
software that's on the flagship LG g6
if you've used LG's UX recently you'll
know that it's not that different from
stock Android it's a very clean
experience with only a few minor design
tweaks to keep things fresh for example
there's no app drawer by default the
settings menu is organized by tabs and
system apps have their own designs you
can really take advantage of the q6 this
18 by 9 display with nougats
split-screen multitasking feature
there's plenty of vertical space for two
apps so you can comfortably browse the
web while also watching a YouTube video
we are sure many users will appreciate
this balanced approach to software as it
has left a solid polished experience
that can't be said about all phones in
this price category so it's nice knowing
you get exactly what you expect if
you're in India you can purchase the LG
q6 now for 15,000 rupees that's about
two hundred thirty four dollars but
we're not sure when this phone will make
it to the States
color options include black platinum and
gold there's also a slightly lower end
q6 a and a slightly higher end q6 plus
we expect that these devices will offer
similar overall experiences to wrap up
we are very impressed that LG was able
to bring their full vision display
technology to such a low price point the
displays 18 by 9 aspect ratio along with
the phone's minimal bezels truly makes
the q6 stand out from its competitors we
also really like the compact size and
clean software experience however the
phones lack of a fingerprint reader
unimpressive cameras and other minor
issues just make it tough to recommend
the phone over competing options if
you're ok with its flaws and really want
the display though you'll be happy with
the LG q6 and that will be all for this
