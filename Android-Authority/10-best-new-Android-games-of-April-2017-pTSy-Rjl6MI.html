handing the android authority app guy
and it's about that time of april to
round up the best new android games that
were released over the last month if you
want to try out any of these games for
yourself you can find those links in the
video description below age of empires
castle siege is the latest Age of
Empires game it plays a lot like any
Kingdom builder like clash of clans
you'll be tasked with building a base
along with an army you then use that
army to destroy bases while trying to
defend your own it also features heroes
decent graphics and more gameplay
features it is a freemium game and that
means it has the usual freemium game
pitfalls however aside from that and a
few bugs most people seem to be enjoying
it any crate is a local multiplayer game
you and a friend are placed on either
side of the screen and then you faceoff
to see who can complete the challenges
first there is also a co-op mode where
you can compete challenges together
against an AI during gameplay characters
can be upgraded and there are various
different characters with various
different mechanics it also features
many different levels if you want more
to do it's completely free to play with
no in-app purchases and thankfully the
advertising isn't too bad either chicken
scream is a platform game that went
viral the basic idea is that you talk
and yell to get a chicken to walk and
jump the softer your voice the slower
the chicken goes the louder and longer
that you yell the higher and further it
jumps there are also other chickens that
you can unlock and the levels can get
pretty challenging there are a bunch of
ads however the game is otherwise pretty
fun it's not much more than a time
killer but we kind of didn't expect it
to be it's currently free to download
and play guardians of the galaxy is the
latest game from Telltale Games it is an
episodic adventure game like most of
their other titles it'll also have
puzzle elements as well as combat
mechanics it features a story about a
powerful artifact and the artifact must
be kept out of the hands of the bad guys
it also features decent voice acting as
well as decent graphics you can get the
first episode for $4.99 with a $15
in-app purchase to get the other four
episodes when they're released
luminosity is one of the most unique
games that we've ever seen the graphics
are actually photos of a real set to the
developers built that gives it a very
different look and feel compared to most
games your job will be to go on an event
sure solve puzzles and save your
kidnapped grandfather the developers
boast an eight to ten hour storyline no
one app purchases no advertising and
some fun mechanics it's currently going
for $4.99 mega Noi 2017 is a fun little
retro shooter your goal is to make it to
the end of each level without dying
levels are randomly generated so each
playthrough is a little bit different
and additionally there are power-ups to
let you change the mechanics and layout
of any given level that means you can
make rocket launchers misfire or unlock
alternate routes to the end
there are also bonus areas to find and a
database to look at all of the enemy
info it's unique and it goes for 399
with no in-app purchases non-stop Chuck
Norris is an action game you control
Chuck Norris as you mow down wave after
wave of bad guys it's a bit of a weird
game Chuck Norris will go wherever he
wants to go and your only job is to make
him do fighting moves he'll be gifted
with weapons and armor as you play to
increase your toughness other than that
there really isn't too much to this one
it's a time waster through and through
and it's a free-to-play game with in-app
purchases Nova legacy is the newest fps
in the Nova franchise for those who
don't know it's a sci-fi shooter with
aliens explosions and all kinds of other
mayhem the graphics and controls are
both above average and the game also
includes crafting a story mode special
events online multiplayer and a special
ops mode frankly there is just a ton of
stuff that you can do it's a freemium
game and that's a little bogus
considering previous Nova games weren't
however it's not too bad once you get
past that office space idle profits is a
simulation game and it's also based off
of the movie of the same name you'll
play as the various characters from the
movie as you skim profits out of initech
it features some odd and goofy gameplay
mechanics and you can reenact some
scenes from the actual movie it's fair
to say that the game is meant to get a
little money out of the movies fanbase
it is a freemium game after all however
it's one that can also be enjoyable
Planescape torment EE is the latest epic
RPG out of beam Dawg it's a port of the
old PC game of the same game that has
been remastered for Android the game
boasts a 50-plus our storyline complex
mechanics and controls tons of stuff to
do and deep lore about the world you
play in due to the complexity of the
controls we recommend much larger
screens while playing this game it's
also not for the
of heart it runs for $9.99 but it's also
a gigantic game and that about does it
for this one folks if you want to check
out any of these games for yourself we

description below and also don't forget
