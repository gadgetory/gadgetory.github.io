sometimes it's hard to maneuver all
around the screen and when that happens
we have to perform a bit of a balancing
act unfortunately there is some
discomfort when it comes to this kind of
maneuver and also there's not a whole
lot of freedom when it comes to using
your phone in this way well there is a
company out there looking to alleviate
this very problem with a small product
that you just attach to the back of your
phone hey it's Josh regard for manager
authority Oh what's going on everybody
and this is a review of the fly grip so
once you get through unboxing the fly
grip itself you essentially are left
with a little piece of plastic that
looks like this all kept together via a
hinge and then of course the front bar
is stuck onto the back bar using a
pretty powerful magnet on the back of
the rear piece of plastic is a cut of
adhesive essentially what this little
piece of plastic is supposed to do is
attach to the back of your phone and
when you take out the outer part of the
plastic you are given two particular
grooves here in which you can insert two
fingers now the question when it comes
to a product like this is of course
number one isn't useful but also number
two is it practical
now practicality in this particular
sense would mean when you have a phone
like say the nexus 5 that looks really
nice on its own are you really willing
to add something to the back of it that
for all intents and purposes could take
away from the general look of the phone
essentially if I were to put the flagger
behind there my grip would remain right
here and no matter where my hand is
positioned I should be able to reach
everything on the screen in a very
comfortable way alright so here is the
Nexus 5 along with the whitefly grip I
figure that the whitefly grip will blend
in a lot better with the white one
however there are a lot of colors that
are available for the fly grip that you
can have for whatever particular kind of
style you're looking for not completely
centered and there you go I guess we
could pretty much say that
maneuverability on the Nexus 5 has
become even easier than it was before
and then of course you have the ability
to use it as a kickstand if you so wish
there you have it for this look at the
fly grip essentially this is a product
that sets out to do one particular thing
and I give it a lot of credit because it
succeeds at doing that I do find that I
have more comfort using my phones when
using the fly grip then I wouldn't have
had if I use that balancing act that I
mentioned before however I will tell you
this much it does add a little bit more
girth to your phone now whether or not
that is something you want is entirely
up to you personally for me I try to
keep my phones about as naked as
possible but if you do find that the fly
grip is a product for you I would
recommend perhaps putting it on a case
probably the slimmest case you can find
for your phone so when our fly grip
review units came in included with them
were a couple of special ones with
Android or tea colors put on to actual
cases for the Galaxy Note 3 and the
galaxy s4 so as you can see there this
is just a really really light weight
case that is available flag grip does
include cases with a couple of their
products and as you can see here about
as easy as can be just throw it right on
and I'm able to use the Galaxy Note 3
the fly grip way and also the nice thing
about the fly grip is that it adheres to
pretty much any smartphone like I said
you could put it on a case then adhesive
on the back we'll go on to pretty much
any surface so if you do want it on your
cell phone it'll most likely work on
there but if you want on a case it'll
work on that as well so if you think
that the fly grip is a product that
could help you with your smartphone life
you can head over to the fly grip
website and we have a deal for you
the flag grips come in at around $30
apiece and a few of them include cases
that you can put them on but if you use
the promo code holiday 2013 you'll get
free shipping on your entire order this
might be a nice nifty little tool to
give somebody for the holidays so think
about that but also if you try it for
yourself you might find that your
smartphone is a lot easier to use once
you throw the fly grip on it stay tuned
