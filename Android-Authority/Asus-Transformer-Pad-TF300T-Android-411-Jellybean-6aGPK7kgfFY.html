Youngberg coming at you from Android
Authority calm your number one source
for all things Android today we've got a
quick overview of an unofficial
CyanogenMod Ted ROM now that's the jelly
bean build and this is on the Asus TF
300 T the e pad so we're gonna be
getting a first look at what a jelly
bean looks like I'm the transformer pad
here we'll just walk through some of the
stuff no mind you this is unofficial
it's from a dump of the Nexus 7 so a lot
of the features aren't working and
there's not even a Google Apps package I
was able to flash but this is just to
show you what jelly bean might look like
on a bigger sized tablet so let's go
ahead and go through some of the user
interface you can see we have our
clickable status bar just like we do an
Ice Cream Sandwich and then we have our
notifications where we can just swipe
away anyways we hit these settings
toggles there we get the entire menu
there we've got airplane mode Wi-Fi
which is fully functional auto rotate is
functional our brightness control is
definitely functional we have our
notifications and then we can go to our
full settings menu here that's where we
can access Wi-Fi Bluetooth under the
more settings we only have airplane mode
and VPN if you've got our sound options
or display and storage I've been having
some problems with the storage because I
put a SD card in there but it is not
recognizing that just yet I think that
just might be a kink that needs to be
worked out with the jellybean OS anyways
we can manage our apps in the new ways
here where we can select whether or not
they show up in a notification bar which
is functional as of now we have our
location services our security we can
add our accounts just like that now
we're not able to add a Google account
because I have not flashed a Google Apps
package for some reason I can't store
anything on the SD card of this device
while it is running jelly bean anyways
we can go into our about tablet see that
we are running the 4.1.1 we even have
our little easter egg here with all of
our different jelly beans and stuff
so we'll go back under Oh developer
options we have a few more options we
can turn them on or off all of them can
be completely turned on anyways let's
enable USB debugging we can show our
touches we can force GPU rendering and
the Tegra 3 really just makes this
project butter even more buttery smooth
go back we don't get the Google now from
long pressing the home button but we do
have our recent apps no option to remove
all of the recent apps at one time but
we do have our jelly bean physics with
our widgets we can move them out of the
way you don't have any of our native
Google widgets we'll go ahead and go
into our app tray here you see this is
what's pre-installed as of now it does
not come with ROM manager and the DSP
manager as well as Apollo music all
things of CyanogenMod source this will
go right we can see we do have all of
our widgets with the calendar widget
even though it's not synched with
anything because there is no Google
calendar we have our settings shortcut
our photo gallery let's go ahead and add
a power control just to show some of the
physics of jellybean here
sanity's we got that running this is
what jellybean is going to look like
almost you know exactly to a tee is just
is missing some of the functionality of
jellybean but stay tuned guys because
we're gonna get a lot more functional
builds coming especially for the Asus TF
300 T this is a very good device anyways
you guys if you want to try this ROM out
go ahead we'll provide the link in the
description you're going to need to have
a rooted device clockworkmod recovery
installed but just flash the zip make
sure you've got a backup round you want
a flash in case you're trying to get off
of this and you might soft break your
device but anyways guys that's just a
preview of what the jellybean OS is
gonna look like I'm larger tablets such
as the Asus TF 300 T</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
