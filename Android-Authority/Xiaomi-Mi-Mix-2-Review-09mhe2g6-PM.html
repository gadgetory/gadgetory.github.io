basically the philosophy behind the
Xiaomi mean mix but now Xiaomi finds
itself in a marketplace that might be a
little bit oversaturated with small
bezel designed phones that they kind of
pioneered with their original device but
now we have the sophomore attempt and
we're here to review it because it's jar
Trafigura what's going on everybody and
this is our full review of this yummy me
mix - now one of the first things that
you will notice about this device is the
screen and for good reason you still get
a very high screen to body ratio on the
Xiaomi me mix - and it's still one of
the most pleasing devices to look at
just like the original one was but once
you look at what's around that display
you find that quite a few things have
actually changed mainly the size you
have a 5.9 9 inch screen on here which
makes the entire device that much
smaller the curves that have been added
to the me mix - might make the phone
feel a little bit too familiar compared
to other phones that have minimal bezels
and we're going to harp on the grip of
the device because the ceramic returns
on the backing and it's still one of the
best materials that we have ever felt on
any smartphone and s√°mi is the main
company that still uses it on their
devices on that backing is the same
finger parameter in a good spot and
under it the me branding that keeps
everything looking pretty minimal
however the same compromise that helped
this become a reality on the original me
mix returns again and it's that large
chin on the bottom that also includes
the front-facing camera in probably one
of the worst positions that we've used
in any smart phone not only is it easy
to cover up the camera with one's right
hand it makes for an odd angle that
selfie experts will not be too happy
with sure the camera app tells the user
to turn the phone around when it comes
to taking a more conventional selfie but
that's not something that you can do in
apps like Instagram and snapchat but the
vibration speaker that we didn't really
like in the original me mix for the
phone calls has been replaced with an
actual phone speaker it's a small driver
that points upward and it actually
sounds so much better than last year's
alternative so thus this phone addresses
a couple of issues that made the
original one a little bit less
accessible however if you ask me this
already pretty phone would have been
made better if we could get our hands on
the special edition the special edition
of the me mix 2 comes with a ceramic
unibody so that it doesn't have to cut
the material to make room for a metal
frame it's all ceramic wrapped
that beautiful screen and then there's
actually a version that is completely
white which makes it one of the more
unique devices that we've looked at in
recent memory Xiaomi claimed that this
white version is a lot like a perfect
piece of jade and this is definitely the
addition of the me mix to that I would
rock because of its crazy good looks the
size of the display makes it pretty good
to handle though getting up and down the
phone with Han gymnastics will still be
part of the experience and brightness is
pretty much where it should be for an
IPS display when out in broad daylight
you can change the color profile in the
settings and there is a reading mode to
sort of make things a little bit easier
on your eyes especially during the
nighttime honestly the only misstep when
it comes to the screen here on the mix
too is that it is still full HD plus
resolution it would have been great to
see quad HD on here because what we're
looking at here are supposed to be one
of C Ami's main flagships but keeping up
with the flagship game is not tough when
you look at the internals the Snapdragon
835 is accompanied with overachieving
bits like six to eight gigabytes of RAM
that come in at different price points
storage is also not a problem for a
phone that doesn't have a micro SD card
slot as 64 128 or 256 gigabytes of
internal storage are available so I
really had no problem with everyday
performance on the mix - zipping between
applications despite the actual software
itself being a little rough around the
edges as this is a global ready phone
Google Play services were pre-installed
on this device so I could use it to its
fullest extent here in the US more
radios are in this phone than any other
device in Android thus far which makes
this a phone that you can use pretty
much anywhere across the globe so when I
use the phone on my t-mobile account I
had no problems with calls and call
quality on that GSM network sound in
other situations is a bit of a mixed bag
unfortunately without a headphone jack
users are forced to use a USB type-c
adapter to use wired headphones with the
mix too but thankfully I do have my own
solutions for that with a truly wireless
set of earbuds but that wasn't really
quite as upsetting as the external
speaker outside in noisy environments
this just didn't get loud enough and
then if I lowered the volume to around
50% or below it felt like there was a
noise gate there so that lower ends of
the audio we're kind of getting cut off
and it made for a really odd listening
experience now one real bright spot to
the original me mix was the battery life
maybe it's because of the full HD plus
resolution in the screen and also
because of the upgraded internals but
this
400 milliamp hour a unit was able to get
me to five hours of screen on time
without any issues and that was a pretty
consistent metric and that screen on
time was throughout the course of a 12
to 16 hour workday most of those days
and of course you can charge the phone
with quick charge 3.0 but it wasn't
something I felt like I had to do at
least in the middle of my days so that
brings us to the camera experience which
unfortunately Seon me kind of took the
more conventional route when you see
them kind of doing more experimental
things with their other flagships well
this doesn't really take into account
the front-facing camera which is itself
unconventional and like I said before
just simply odd I do a lot of video
calls these days and that was when I
found the camera positioning to be far
less than ideal on a number of different
occasions I was told that I was
basically looking away from them because
the camera is down here and I was
looking above at their face on the
screen so it was a little bit
distracting they admitted but also if I
tried to look at the camera itself it
also felt a little bit odd and most of
the time if I'm holding the phone in a
regular way I got a weird upward angle
and I kind of think that Xiaomi knows
that the positioning of the camera while
unavoidable is kind of weird because
they even made the camera optic black
enough to blend in with the rest of the
device now the rear camera is a 12
megapixel shooter that boasts 4 axis
optical image stabilization and not too
much else while the stabilization does
help with some of the 4k video recording
that I did and it helped a little bit in
low-light shooting it's about the only
thing that is special about this camera
that said the app does have quite a few
different modes and I found myself using
the manual mode a little bit more often
to try to get some stylized shots for
example I wanted to get some light
trails in these photos so I slowed the
shutter speed down so pictures in
general are pretty good though it's no
surprise that it kind of falls apart in
low-light the HDR captures another pet
peeve of mine because it is a toggle
rather than in auto mode but it does do
a decent job of getting better exposure
and adding a little bit of color to
scenes even if it does make the shutters
of file speeds a lot slower
the main story here is that the camera
did nothing to really blow me away some
pictures and videos came out really well
but the same amount of them kind of came
out a bit subpar I'm inclined to say
that the camera is average then
especially since Xiaomi is trying harder
with their other phones that have dual
cameras and finally make it over to the
software and the
you eye which is rocking Android nougat
as its base now if you have used the me
UI at all before then you know that it
doesn't have an app drawer and a lot of
users kind of find that a little bit
hard to get used to but if you have used
the me UI before not a whole lot has
changed that said there are quite a few
features at the new UI can boast like
the quick ball it's a small convenient
way of getting to the core functions of
the phone without relying on the soft
keys there's also the dual app which
allows for multiple instances of the
same application and you can take that
even further by putting an entirely
different second space on the phone for
an entirely different experience on top
of the one you already setup now the
main issues that I have with the
software are ones that I've seen before
just like the features I just mentioned
and mainly the biggest issue I have with
the me UI is that it requires a little
bit more polish parts of the OS don't
seem to be completely finished or
properly translated from Chinese and the
notifications in particular are a bit
off overall the me UI has come a long
way and continues to be supported by the
user forum community meaning that
updates can come quickly but after one
maybe two generations of flagships from
Xiaomi I'm a little bit miffed to see
that the me UI hasn't drastically
changed which makes me think it's just
simply not ready for primetime in the
West if you are going to get your hands
on this device and so there you have it
the Xiaomi me mix 2 while I'm still
excited to be able to use a ceramic
phone again and it is another me mix
unfortunately the luster of the original
device has kind of worn off by now if
you really want it to stand out from the
crowd maybe the best way to do it is to
spring for the special edition of the
phone which will come in at around seven
hundred and twenty dollars u.s. when
converted from Chinese currency now
consider that for a second that the
special edition white ceramic one is
seven hundred and twenty dollars u.s.
the six gigabytes of RAM and 128
gigabytes internal storage version is
almost $600 making it over three hundred
dollars less than plenty of the
flagships we're seeing now that get
close to $1,000 in price so see ami
still does have that feather in its cap
the fact that its phones are still about
as affordable as they possibly can be so
depending on your stance regarding the
lower resolution display the single
camera and the Chinese software
experience this might be one hell of a
steal and thus we want to blame you if
you wanted to go back to the phone that
got us all wanting all screen all the
time
you simply just have to find a way to
get your hands on one let us know what
you think of the me mix too and don't
forget to drop some likes on this video
