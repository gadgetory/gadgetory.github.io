Android authority app guy do you like
RPGs I know I do and after the intro we
got a list of the best RPGs you can find
on Android we'll start out with one of
the most useful apps on the list of
course we're talking about emulators
while they aren't technically RPGs a lot
of great RPGs were released on older
consoles that can be found and played
again with the use of emulators in some
cases it may be preferable as some
emulators have features like increasing
game speed which really helps with
tedious tasks like level grinding the
three emulators that are best for gaming
are SNES Playstation and Game Boy
advanced emulators why because they had
some of the best RPGs of all time all
the best Final Fantasy's including four
five six seven eight and nine Chrono
Trigger Mario RPG lunr Legend of Dragoon
Star Ocean earthbound Xenogears Pokemon
and dozens more would be at your
fingertips
beware though as PlayStation games can
be pretty large so if you're crunched
for space you may only be able to have
one game on at a time it's also worth
noting that this is the only way to get
a Zelda or Pokemon experience on mobile
since neither franchise has yet to
release any real offerings for Android
if you're wondering if Chrono Trigger is
worth playing here's some quick facts
IGN puts Chrono Trigger as the number
two best RPG ever made game informer
puts it as the 15th best game ever
created both of those lists include
modern RPG titles why is it ranked so
high because Chrono Trigger is one of
the most iconic popular and original RPG
titles of all time you can get Chrono
Trigger for Android and you can also get
it for an emulator there are caveats to
each one the emulator version doesn't
have any of the newer content from more
recent releases meanwhile the Android
version has issues of its own when it
comes to controls as they require a
break-in period before you feel
comfortable with them regardless this
timeless classic features a robust
storyline with over a dozen different
endings a great soundtrack lovable
characters and it was designed by the
guys who did Final Fantasy along with
the guys to be a dragon ball and the
guys who did Dragon Quest no one who
loves RPGs can hate that next on the
list is covenant of Solitude like Final
Fantasy and Chrono Trigger covenant of
solitude is a top-down 2d RPG you start
the game as a youth who can talk to
monsters after a horrific experience you
end up at depressed youth in jail
wanting to be killed but as these things
go fate has a different plan this game
focuses around the main
ability to summon monsters and talk to
them there is a lot of dialogue so
people who don't like dialogue are gonna
get pretty frustrated at least early on
otherwise the controls are nice and
simple the graphics are on par with most
of the other games on this list and is
definitely worth checking out
defender of Texel is one of the most
unique RPGs on the list it doesn't
really fit into any normal styles of RPG
and plays more like a Facebook flash
game than anything you have a finite
amount of rounds that you can play
before you have to stop and wait to
recover there are also in app purchases
the gameplay is quick and simple with
most of the game being spent going on
missions to kill monsters and defend the
world of Texel you fight battles with up
to nine characters and you can choose up
to three at a time by swiping them
inside the character box each round you
earn experience in items which you can
then use to build more troops and level
up your current ones this is definitely
more for the casual gamer rather than
the hardcore RPG fan but the RPG
elements are there and people seem to
really enjoy it Eve of Genesis is one of
those traditional top-down 2d RPGs like
your usual Final Fantasy game you start
in a small town and must immediately go
help one of your lady friends who ran
into a cave to find adventure as these
RPGs typically go the adventure ends up
being quite an epic one this is
definitely one of the best top-down RPGs
on the list the developers put a lot of
small details into the game to make it
feel more complete you can see your
swipe movements on the touchscreen
characters move their mouths when they
talk and most of the gameplay is crisp
and clean things like that do actually
matter the storyline is pretty decent
too so if you're looking for a top-down
RPG that isn't final fantasy or Zelda
this is one of the best alternatives
creating a best RPG list and not having
a Final Fantasy title on there somewhere
is practically blasphemy the second
highest selling RPG series of all time
behind only pokemon has a surprisingly
strong Android presence since Final
Fantasy games typically follow the same
overall theme we've included both Final
Fantasy 3 and Final Fantasy dimensions
together on this list in both games RPG
enthusiasts will be treated to the
original Final Fantasy experience you'll
level up your characters wander around
the world map in search of treasure and
adventure and defend the crystals from
the bad guys many people including ones
around my age grew up playing these
kinds of games so if nothing else the
nostalgia alone makes these games worth
owning
so if old-school Final Fantasy is what
you're looking for
Final Fantasy 3 and Final Fantasy
dimensions are the best offerings you
get it's also noteworthy that Square
Enix will be releasing Final Fantasy for
sometime during the spring of 2013
that'll be worth picking up as well our
next app is called Zenonia 5 we're
trying to cover as many RPG types as
possible and when it comes to hack and
slash style RPGs where you walk around
kill bad guys and complete quests
Zenonia 5 is at the pinnacle of its onra
this is definitely for the more casual
RPG fans who don't want the tedious
level grinding or the long winded
dialogues that often come with in-depth
storylines
the premise is pretty simple you create
a character and then you were tossed
into a world where you talked to people
except missions heck bad guys to bits
gain levels and other RPG type stuff in
addition there is a player versus player
element where gamers can face one
another in one-on-one battles so there
is that multiplayer aspect as well our
next game Soulcraft is among the best
looking titles on the list while it
won't compare to the biggest names and
games on consoles it still outshines
more than 90% of the stuff you can find
on Android
this hack and slash style RPG keeps it
simple for the casual gamer without
being too boring to chase away more
serious enthusiasts unlike other hack
and slash RPGs on this list Soulcraft
plays more like gauntlet legends you
move from level to level slashing down
bad guys at the end of each level you
can use the souls and money you've found
to purchase upgrades the controls are
dead simple and the graphics are nice
and no levels really take that long so
if you're more into button mashing and
quick level play this is one of the best
titles to try out last on our list is
order and chaos online for you MMO RPG
fans out there this is the game on the
list that you've been waiting for it
features a few worlds that you can play
and real-life people that you can
interact with whether it's battling it
out or working together order and chaos
online is that portable MMO that you've
been craving in fact during the testing
I had a character saved my life from a
wolf I was clearly too low level to be
dealing with thank you again
random online person it plays pretty
much like any other MMORPG there's third
person view hack and slash battle system
leveling up some character customization
and full playability with other people
so if you're looking to get into MMORPG
s on Android this is definitely the
title to do it with if you take a look
at our leaderboard you can see how all
these RPG stack up against one another
these ranks are based on their ratings
in the Google Play Store so there is no
personal bias on our part this is how
the people who have played these games
have rated them we found it a little
comforting that Square Enix is on this
list because it shows that major games
too
are starting to take Android a little
more seriously which means there are
better games on the horizon for everyone
