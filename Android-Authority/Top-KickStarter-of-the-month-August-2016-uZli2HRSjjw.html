to take a look at what new innovative
technology is headed our way from a car
projector for your phone to sneakers
that act as your personal running coach
this is top Kickstarter's of the month
this first project allows you to safely
look at your phone while driving it's
called hudley a full-color heads-up
display for all cars and phone apps it
projects the information you need from
your phone onto an optical glass that
you place on your windshield using
technology that was originally made for
military aviation hudley let's car
drivers quickly view information from
their phones without having to look at
the actual phone so there's no need to
glance at your cup holder or have a
friend hold your phone for you and it's
even better than regular car mounts
because the phone projects directly in
your line of sight and not off to the
side and this will work with any phone
running either iOS or Android hudley
really lets you take advantage of any
hands-free Mo's your phone may have to
safely access any app you need and it
really comes in handy when using any
navigation apps because the directions
will look as if they're actually on the
road using apps specifically designed
for hudley create an even greater
experience there's also a built-in light
sensitivity sensor making sure that you
can see the projected image through any
lighting conditions day or night if
hudley comes to the market it will be
available in December and it will retail
at two hundred and forty nine dollars so
this Kickstarter campaign with seeking a
goal of 100 thousand dollars and so far
has only received thirty thousand
dollars but there's still 20 days to go
so there's still some hope this next
project is something that i really wish
i had and i probably need is called the
gaze desk the gays desk is a standing
smart desk that you can control to your
phone's Bluetooth connectivity it's a
dual lift system that will adjust to the
best position for you according to the
height and weight you enter in its app
the desk will adjust as you approach it
and we'll even remind you if you've been
sitting for too long by sending alerts
to your phone watch or any other IOT
devices along with the desk comes a foot
mat that will tell you if you've been
leaning too much on one leg and they
make sure that you're balancing your
weight evenly while standing over time
the gaze desk app will monitor your
stats for accuracy and can eat
alert your Twitter followers have you
been sitting for too long with gays desk
there is no need to hunch over to type
or look at your monitor everything will
adjust accordingly using it's well
thought out ergonomic dual lift system
the idea of having a standing desk is
something that I've considered for a
while because I'm constantly sitting at
my desk for hours to edit videos and
with that comes a lot of back and neck
pains and a lot of chiropractor visits
but the gaze says seems like the way to
go with all its functionality and on top
of all that already does it can also
activate connected devices for example
smart lamps air purifiers and many other
smart devices like the nest thermostat
the creators of gays desks have even
developed a kid's version and they're
planning on shipping their first models
in November of this year now they're
really close to reaching their $100,000
goal with about twenty thousand dollars
left to go and with 30 days left I think
is safe to say they'll be coming now
let's take a look at dot a physical push
notification button then knows where
your phone is at all times many of us
receive tons of notifications for things
that may not be too important and then
the important stuff tends to get lost in
all the noise while Dodd helps you see
that important information in the right
place at the right time based on where
you r dot will send you notifications
for that important information in order
to make your everyday life easier and
all you have to do is download the app
and place that somewhere useful dot has
many uses including the ability to
launch our naps when you walk near it
for example place a dot near the couch
and it will open your ebook to where you
last left off you can also create
digital postage with dot by placing it
near the fridge it can remind somebody
else in the house to take out the trash
when they walk near it you can get
location updates as well so when you're
at work it will send you relevant
information based on where you are and
custom shortcut LEDs are also an option
so you can customize a dots color based
on certain situations therefore it can
act as a physical signal that you can
just glance at the possibilities really
seem endless dot seems like the perfect
solution for anyone that's looking to
organize and simplify their life and
what's also great is that it will be
open to developers dot will be available
in march of the upcoming year as they're
well past their 20 dozen our goal with
over thirty thousand dollars pledged and
they still have 20 days to go
and next up is step the world's most
advanced real-time running coach that
helps you run better step is made of
three sensors to for your shoes plus one
that attaches at your hip and it
collects data based on your movement
when running it monitors your entire
lower body in depth to make sure that
you're running the most efficient way
possible using its app and a pair of
earbuds step will tell you if you're
over-striding tilting your hip too much
or even if your muscles are fatigued and
it will tell you exactly what to do to
fix this no matter what type of runner
you are whether it be a more casual
level one or more advanced one step will
cater to your knees based upon the data
collected from its sensors the app goes
beyond the run as well you can view and
track your progress and using your
running history it will provide you with
an updated training plan to make sure
that you get the most out of each run as
a regular runner myself this really
appeals to me because I'm always looking
at how I can improve and with the push
of a button it will help me run faster
and longer with tips on how to avoid
muscle aches it just seems so easy and
hassle-free to with about 40 days ago
step is seeking a goal of 70 thousand
dollars and so far they've only gathered
about 30 thousand dollars so if they
reach that goal you can expect to see
step in july of next year retailing at
one hundred ninety nine dollars a set so
that'll do it for this installment of
top Kickstarter's of the month if you
want to check out any of the projects I
talked about or even become a supporter
