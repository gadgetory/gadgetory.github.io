very famous McAfee Antivirus software
McAfee has come out with what he calls
the privacy phone my question is not
only will the phone sell and be
successful but will McAfee x' checkered
reputation actually help or hinder its
sales now before we get too far we
should remember that in most justice
systems people who are charged with
crimes are innocent until proven guilty
John McAfee has been accused of some
very serious crimes by the Belizean
police he lived in Belize for a number
of years and instead of standing against
those accusations in court he chose to
flee Belize and came back to the US does
it look good on him say what you will
about the Belizean justice system I
don't know but if you don't know who
John McAfee is here's a quick rundown
McAfee is best known for founding McAfee
associates in 1987 which released the
first commercial computer antivirus
software also called McAfee he left the
company he founded in 1994 and since
then he has put money into a number of
other tech ventures as well as other
investments he also lived in the country
of Belize for several years and in 2012
he came into the spotlight again when
belizean police department started
searching for him as quote a person of
interest in the murder of one of his
neighbors Gregory by a fault
McAfee decided to flee the country
instead and ended up back in the US
where he still lived today in 2016 a
documentary on Showtime Cable portrayed
McAfee as a wild and crazy person it
alleged that he was involved in not one
but two murders and that he engaged in
rape drug use and more criminal
activities
McAfee denied the betrayal himself and
said that he was going to sue the
filmmakers it's safe to say however that
McAfee is not your normal button-down
tech geek no matter which version of the
man you believe is real now let's talk
about his privacy phone earlier last
week he posted an image of what he
called the first prototype of the
privacy phone on his Twitter account and
it clearly shows that it's running some
version
of Android now you must be thinking what
would make this so called privacy phone
any more successful than other devices
that have tried to target the same
market remember the black phone yeah
that never took off in terms of sales
here's what McAfee said to that well in
a chat with Newsweek McAfee says that
it's all about the hardware specifically
he claims that owners will be able to
remove not just the battery but also the
phone's Wi-Fi Bluetooth and geolocation
hardware along with its camera and
microphone he adds that the privacy
phone will be protected from IMSI
catcher devices that are designed to
intercept mobile phone traffic and
location data finally the web browser
and the privacy phone is supposed to
include an anonymizer so when you search
on your browser you won't get hit by ads
ok interesting quite a bit different
than anything we've heard about in the
past but my question is why name it the
privacy phone that's like putting a
massive target on your forehead there
are armies upon armies of hackers out
there who would love to take a crack at
the phone and it's just inviting a
dangerous me right and hackers don't
even need to actually really have a
serious breach on the phone they just
need to crack it a little bit so they
can say yeah they hacked the privacy
phone and then it becomes a joke of the
tech industry better to say that it is
the phone for business users because
business users just want something that
is more secure than the average device
they accept that you know it's the price
of doing business that they may get
hacked but there's a lot more emphasis
on security on that device there's a lot
more more effective marketing there and
you're not setting yourself up to become
a meme now McAfee is holding off
revealing specific hardware specs of the
privacy phone until the week before it's
launched that is supposed to happen
sometime later this year the phone will
be priced at a hefty $1100 when it is
released
McAfee claims that it's mostly targeting
enterprise users but he believes it will
also attract buyers who simply want a
more secure mobile phone experience he
seems very confident that it will be a
success so much so that he says that the
second version of the phone is already
planned for summer of 2018
which McAfee claims quote will be as
hack-proof as humanly possible reminds
me of someone else who likes to
overstate things and he referred to my
hands if they're small something else
must be small I guarantee you there's no
problem I guarantee now I was just asked
this question yesterday what's the most
secure Android phone and if you're a
tech savvy person and you have the time
there are a number of ways to secure
your Android phone on your own if you
want to root your phone there's a whole
bunch of resources out there you can go
to xda-developers
and they have a number of different
options if you're willing to take the
time to have granular control over your
device you can do that but it's time
consuming and it's definitely not user
friendly for the average Android user
out there so there is a market for a
more business secure focused phone out
there but even if you don't mind
McAfee checkered past and you want to
consider this phone are you willing to
pay $1,100 us for it maybe maybe set an
enterprise users but not from this guy
what do you think let me know in the
comments below or right there on
Twitterverse meet Jeremy Schoemaker
otherwise known as shoe money and he
became famous for this photo where he
showed off a cheque that he made from
Google Adsense and he's become so good
at making online businesses that he made
an announcement that he does not start a
new business unless he can secure the
business's name in a.com now why is that
