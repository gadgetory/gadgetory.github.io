Authority what's going on everybody and
we're back with another hangout style
versus for you guys this time pitting
the LG g5 versus the LG v10 now we did
hear you guys's feedback and we're not
necessarily using hangouts here but we
are on a call I am at least with LAN
when who's over there you can probably
see a shot of him right now and the
reason why we're doing this for the LG
g5 versus the v10 is because if you guys
remember I did not do any reviews or any
content really on the LG v10 so even
though I got this v10 in my hands right
now I wanted to make sure that we got a
comprehensive and at least
conversational versus down with one of
the people that spent a lot of time with
this one and that's of course LAN over
there how's it going long it's going
pretty well
so you spend a lot of time with the v10
and I suppose we'll just go ahead and
jump right into it the first thing I'll
say is if you want to see the full
reviews for both of these lon actually
did the full reviews for the v10 and the
g5 so make sure you head over to the
Android authority page and our YouTube
channel to see those full reviews if you
need that information but we'll start
off I obviously have the g5 here as well
and we'll talk about that in a little
bit but lon what can you tell me about
the what do you think about the v10
especially in terms of let's start off
with a little bit of design how did it
how did it look and feel it's very
different from any LG device that we've
seen in the past even very different
from the g5 itself it's comprised of a
couple different materials it's made of
stainless steel along the rail so on the
left and right sides you have the
stainless steel rails and it's 316l
stainless steel if you want to get
specific so it's really sturdy and it's
also made of a during order guard
material which is a sort of a high
quality silicone and it gives it a lot
of grip but these two materials combine
basically make this phone military-grade
resistant against drops so if you're a
klutz and you happen to drop your phone
a lot this phone is capable of taking
that sort of punishment or if you just
live sort of a rough-and-tumble
lifestyle this phone is going to live up
to that the g5 obviously is made of
a metal design of course metal is a
little bit controversial when it comes
to how it was let's say anodized or
painted and whatnot so you know you can
take what you will on that but really
when it comes to its overall let's say
aesthetic you still have the power bun
on the back that's also the fingerprint
reader which the v10 also had but I
don't know I missed those buttons on the
back honestly and this this this overall
design it which is really very iconic
for LG and I honestly kind of really
miss it the other thing too is that you
have the modular design on the g5
obviously which means that you can take
the bottom portion off and be able to
take out the battery and put it into
other bits and pieces that will then add
to the function of the phone the v10
doesn't have that but the backing is
removable for everybody yep there it is
as I just removed it right there so
again a bit of a classical look for the
LG v10 and especially with this nice
textured backing it's not going to slip
about which actually I think is um did
you have any problems with handling on
this phone because it's kind of big it's
not necessarily bulky but it is a wide
and tall phone so even if you're coming
from like a Galaxy Note 5 or in Nexus 6p
it still feels even bigger than those
phones it a little bit so and if you're
coming from something like a 5 inch
phone you're definitely going to feel
the difference with this it's definitely
not exactly a what I would call a
one-handed phone
so obviously the g5 is the newer of the
two devices we're technically taking a
look at what you could consider two of
LG's best phone so I think goes very
worthy of us to take a look at these
because personally if the v10 comes out
with a successor I would hope it to be a
little bit smaller and then I would
probably really go for it but as far as
other features go we can get into it the
Snapdragon 808 for the v10 and obviously
they Snapdragon 820 for the g5 I haven't
really seen any big differences between
these two in terms of performance I mean
for the most parts it's just a pretty
standard but also very reliable and
speedy performance aspect for both of
these
yeah the v10 is it's still a pretty fast
phone even though it's rocking you know
Snapdragon 808 which is obviously at
this point it's a little bit more
outdated if you're looking at benchmarks
and raw numbers of that stuff it's not
going to really hold up to the g5 but in
terms of just regular
every day use it still feels very fast
it plays games well it multitasks it
opens apps all the stuff that you'd
normally want to do in your smartphone
it still does all that stuff perfectly
fine so I never had any issues with it
and it's still just a really good phone
in terms of you know just raw
performance ultimately going to come
down to what your software's like and I
I've made I personally have made some
comments in the past that the LG UX
might be a little - a little too bloated
I suppose a little bit a few too many
features that are not that useful the
the screens we have IPS screens as LG is
usually doing in their Elgin their
flagship devices so you have IPS screens
both at quad HD resolution but it's
really in this second screen now I've
used it a little bit and lawn you also
have much more to say about it the
second screen on the v10 is is pretty
unique it's what makes this phone a
little bit different and it's also part
of the reason why the phone is as large
as it is because the main screen is a
5.7 inch panel but when you count the
secondary screen it actually makes it
pretty close to six inches so that's
part of the reason why the phone is as
big as it is but the secondary screen
does have some functionality built into
it you can toggle on Wi-Fi or turn on
the flash of just various little
functions like that and you can also
sort of use it as a multitasker of sorts
and you can quickly switch between
applications so that's really cool as
well and it also will show you your
notifications in that screen so instead
of the banner notifications popping up
on your main display it actually only
shows up on the secondary screen so it
saves you some screen real estate which
is one of the things that I actually
thought was really cool about that
secondary screen smaller of the two
devices so it's battery is also a bit
smaller as well not buy too much however
you get 2800 milliamp hours in this unit
and for the most part does a pretty good
job it's not going to be a high
performer when you compare it to certain
phones I can go for even two days if you
if you're able to do it with a little
bit of frugal usage but the v10 because
it is larger it does have a 3000 vielen
milliamp hour battery which these days
is kind of the standard what was your
what was your battery life like on the
phone even with the second screen
battery life is actually pretty good
it gets through a full day really easily
no matter what it was that I was doing
whether I was gaming a lot or taking a
lot of pictures with the camera or just
you know checking social media whatever
it is I did and made through the full
day pretty easily but that was really as
far as it went but I never had to
struggle to get through that full day
which was a good thing about the battery
life as with all LG phones it is
removable so you can swap it out for a
fresh one if you like the care carry
spare batteries and it also has fast
charging so you can easily top it up or
fill it up whenever you need to
well the g5 it is satisfactory but add
the best way for me to put it it's not
an above average performer not that
above average I should say but the main
reason why the battery being removable
on the g5 is so important because you
have those modules and we the two of us
have already had our experiences with
various modules the camera grip the cam
plus rather it's called and the Bang &amp;amp;
Olufsen DAC that's supposed to connect
to the bottom as well ultimately if you
have seen any of our vs. videos
involving the g5 recently we do say that
the modules are a great idea it does
make the g5 very different but as of yet
it doesn't really prove itself as a
killer app or a killer feature for the
g5 that said you could still remove the
battery it might be a little bit
difficult to snap it off and then put a
new one in there but at least you still
have that option so if you do need to
get extra power you can definitely do so
with both of these phones which brings
us to the cameras we did mention the cam
plus earlier and it is an interesting
grip and also extra battery for the g5
so that is an added benefit but we're
taking a look at two duo cameras which i
think is interesting because on the v10
and this is something that I didn't
necessarily realize until we had a lot
of our content already out there
the duo camera setup that you see on the
g5 was technically started on the front
of the v10 right one yeah so with the
v10 you have a dual camera setup as well
just like the g5 but on the v10 it is on
the front so they focused more on
front-facing videos and and selfies and
things of that nature
they're both 5 megapixels and one is a
standard angle and the other is a wide
angle so if you want to take really wide
angle selfie
where you can easily fit you know a lot
of your friends and family or just a
bigger chunk of the scenery in the
background you can do that with the
front-facing camera on the g5 and you
can easily switch between them within
the software and it's actually a really
fun front facing shooter so if you love
taking selfies you love taking
front-facing videos things of that
nature or just vlogging this is a really
great camera for that because you can
easily fit yourself into the frame so
well because of that wide-angle lens you
do get the same premise with the rear
cameras on the g5 you still get a
megapixel front facing shooter but if
you really want to get some fun selfies
or if in general you just want have a
lot of fun shooting with the g5 that
white angle is incredibly fun to use it
really adds some cases you're able to
turn on the white angle and just turn
the phone around like this and then
you'll easily get yourself in the shot
because it's such a wide angle lens but
I think the v10 really intrigued me over
the last number of days that I've been
using it that's it's video mode is
actually really robust and it's not a
mode that you get in the g5 you can
actually have a manual video mode which
for us youtubers is incredibly important
and we did take a bunch of photos with
these two phones just to see what the
general quality was like and for the
most part what we found is that really
these two kind of or a bit of a toss-up
it really isn't the apps and the manual
controls that you get some differences
maybe skewing more towards the v10 but
in the case of picture quality for the
most part they're really kind of solid
LG's done a really great job with their
cameras and recent flagships and
ultimately when you have these two
phones with pretty warm coloration what
we really just found was that the g5 had
more contrast but if you're looking at
detail in general then really the two
phones have pretty much the same sensor
and very similar post-processing so you
can kind of take your pick whether or
not you want that wide-angle for the
front of the phone or you want it on the
back of the phone on the g5 which might
prove to be a little bit more useful for
some people depends on who you are you
could have a lot of fun with both of
these cameras alright so software is not
going to be that difficult to talk about
when it comes to these two phones
because after all both of them or LG now
the thing with the v10 is that you have
wealth that second screen up top which
does add some functionality but really
in general this is the LG
you X now the main thing we could
probably talk about is 4g5 because on
the v10 you have what looks like the
usual LG suspects you have the ab drawer
which thankfully stayed in the g5 after
an update and you have all the colorful
icons and maybe just a few extra
features that may or may not be
ultimately useful with the v10 did you
happen to use any of the multi-window
or any of the let's say O's the Q slide
there it is the Q slide applications I
just found here were you're able to use
any of those or did those remain unlike
maybe not so useful features yeah
honestly a lot of the features that LG
implements into their software is
typically for me I don't find it to be
all that useful so stuff like smart
bulletin and qslide and the dual window
functionality I don't really use any of
those features there may be other people
out there that like those features I
personally am NOT a fan of it and I
think some of those features sort of
make the software feel a little bit
below D so and then there's also you
know a lot of other applications a lot
of LG apps in there as well that sort of
add a little bit more to the software
than I would like so I'm not a huge fan
of LG skin on the v10 but maybe other
people out there feel a little bit
differently but it's for me it's just
not my cup of tea in terms of the way
that it looks and the way that it
functions I do think that that makes a
case for the second screen obviously
because with the g5 having kind of made
a bit of a controversial splash not
having the app drawer out of the box now
that it's back it feels a lot like the
v10 only now it's missing a couple of
other features like dual window and the
cute slide is really hidden somewhere on
the side very deep inside of the
settings so that makes the the LG UX of
the g5 actually feel like it took a step
back which is a little bit disconcerting
honestly and really if the next LG phone
is going to have the second screen on it
then that might actually be the killer
app when it comes to the software and
really have the same features when it
comes to security the fingerprint
readers on the back and even not code so
if you want to be able to unlock your
device in a more
myzel wave and you can use the NOC code
for that ultimately though I do think
that these two phones represent some of
the best ideas that LG has had
especially when you take into
consideration the modularity of the g5
and just some of the sheer features of
the v10 especially when you consider
those cameras well for the most part
that's us having our conversation on
this versus between the LG g5 and the LG
v10 these are two of the best phones I
have come out from LG and on the one
hand you have the g5 which is the
current flagship that does a great job
it's a solid phone and it has a couple
of very unique features especially that
dual camera set up and the modularity
but the v10 is almost like a perfecting
I think of LG's design language and also
some of their features LG actually does
have some great cameras on their phones
and they kind of went they went for
broke on the LG v10 so hopefully any
upcoming V Series phones will probably
be very stellar LAN I want to thank you
for helping me out on this versus and as
I said to all of you guys in our triple
threat versus that you saw a while back
we are going to be having more videos
like this just to give a more
conversational tone to our vs. videos
LAN thank you again and make sure you
stay tuned to Android authority for all
the best coverage from the two of us
here in this video you could see his
reviews of both of these phones and you
can see some content from me on the LG
g5 as well I'm going to play around with
the v10 a little bit more but ultimately
stick around and subscribe to the
channel you haven't already drop us some
likes on this video so you can see that
we will continue to have this format for
especially vs. videos and maybe
conversations about future phones as
well I think that should pretty much do
it yeah stick around to Android
authority because LAN we are your source
