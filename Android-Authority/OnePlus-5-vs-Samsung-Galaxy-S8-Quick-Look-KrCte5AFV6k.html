goes up against a comeback story for
Samsung this is Joshua Vergara what's
going on everybody and this is a quick
look at the oneplus 5 versus the Samsung
Galaxy S H Ron has completed his full
review of the one plus 5 so make sure to
check it out in the card and in the
description below for now however I will
be bringing you some quick rundowns
between the oneplus five and a couple of
its competitors with full of comparisons
to come later users of the galaxy s 8
will probably point to its design as the
best part of the phone the infinity
display is definitely a sight to behold
not just because of its curved sides
that allow for easier handling but also
because it is nearly free of bezel the
result has been an enjoyable eighteen
point five to nine ratio display a quad
HD resolution that looks good in its
skin and though the home button might
have gone away it does get an extra
input the Bigsby button speaking of
extra inputs oneplus returns its highly
tactile and useful alert slider to the 1
+ 5 in a body that is slightly different
from before and has its own share of
controversy we won't go as far to say
that the oneplus 5 looks very much like
the iPhone 7 but we do recognize a
couple of the cues that it took from an
iOS competitor mainly the antenna lines
and of course the dual camera up front
the phone is still decidedly 1 plus with
a capacitive array that includes a home
button and fingerprint combo underneath
the 1080p display the display puts the
galaxy s 8 above the oneplus in the
handling Department but also on paper it
is the higher powered panel the SI
display is already bigger than the 5.5
inch flat panel on the oneplus but the
oneplus 5 still rocks the AMOLED 1080p
display well in terms of features our
our number of swipes and gestures that
can be done in standby to fire up the
camera and other shortcuts one of my
favorites however is the reading mode
basically like a Kindle it will
desaturate the display to make it more
comfortable for reading as a Kindle user
I will be testing this feature further
against the e-reader but I already
enjoyed switching to the reading mode
for longer sessions it's nice to have on
the oneplus 5 since it doesn't support a
couple of the more useful Samsung
display features like the edge UX or the
always-on display under the hood power
is definitely not wanting as the
snapdragon 835 powers either of these
phones and the latest 16o makes an
appearance depending on your market for
Samsung
despite its global reach oneplus is
actually taking a page out of an
increasing
the common Chinese phone spec book by
giving not only more than four gigabytes
of RAM but super high capacity storage
the highest spec phone of the bunch will
have eight gigabytes of RAM and 128
gigabytes of storage for a price that is
less than either of the Galaxy S eight
phones and of course it all powers the
different pieces of software for either
phone Samsung's UX has definitely
slimmed down in more recent iterations
and it is still the future rich and
sometimes redundant user experience that
can get bogged down by its own
capabilities Samsung Apps accompany the
already existing Google app ecosystem
for example with Bigsby and Samsung
notes sitting right alongside Google
assistant and Google Drive applications
for our full versus in the future we'll
be looking at the updates to big speed
in which voice input and better vision
recognition are part of the menu on the
other hand oxygen OS reaches its latest
edition and brings new get like look and
feel but also some of one pluses on
flavors the Shelf returns and is still a
nice place to put ones widgets so that
they're out of the way and we mentioned
the gestures and display features from
before there isn't too much else to this
updated version that is overtly
different but that might play to the
strengths of the underdog competitor
after all we are proponent to buying
phones that have the features we will
definitely use instead of the features
we will never touch after the initial
setup which finally brings us to the
camera as I mentioned before a fuller
versus comparison will happen and that
will include picture analysis for now we
will highlight the fact that the Galaxy
S a is one of the flagships this year
that is missing the increasingly key
addition a secondary camera the oneplus
5 manages to tug a 20 megapixel 2x zoom
telephoto lens right next to its 16
megapixel main shooter in order to bring
its own version of zoom and portrait
mode to Android masses the result is a
picture experience that remains very
familiar it's a previous software
meaning that swipes and minimal prices
on the viewfinder are par for the course
we really like the manual pro mode
however which uses a toggle for raw
capture and even includes a histogram
portrait mode is sure to be a hit among
1+5 users as the combination of zoom
high resolution capture and software
bouquet effects will make capturing new
profile pictures pretty damn easy
compare this to the samsung camera which
is a fixed 12 megapixel dual pixel
camera that is similar to last year's
well-received shooters from the s7 and
the note 7 there is little to complain
about for good point and shoot
abilities those Samsung makes sure to
put in a bunch of features and its own
pro mode the front-facing camera here is
one of the only shooters to include
autofocus
but then again oneplus is trying to up
the selfie game by making their
front-facing shooter a whopping 16
megapixel monster again we will be
making comparisons in our upcoming
versus putting these two camera combos
against one another and with that we
hope that you've got a quick but good
glance at what these two phones have to
offer the one plus five is available for
a lesser price outright making it the
appealing choice for anyone that wants
to go outside the typical flagship
spectrum especially after Bigsby finally
properly arrives we will have an even
more in-depth look at this phone soon so
stay tuned for that and watch lawns
review in the meantime to get all you
need of the 1+5 keep it tuned to Android
Authority for even more about the one
plus five as we have a bunch of coverage
coming up this week and remember to stay
