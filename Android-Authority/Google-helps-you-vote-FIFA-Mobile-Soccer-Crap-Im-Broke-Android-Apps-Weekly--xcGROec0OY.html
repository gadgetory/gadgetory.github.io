reads as though you own a pixel after
that assistant should more or less work
for you it's not a perfect solution and
you'll need to have a device running the
latest version of Android nougats it's a
good way to see how the new feature
works the latest humble bundle is now

eight games up for grabs including prism
saga solitaire goat simulator and more

however the game does seem to be dealing
with some early release bugs and many
are complaining about server issues it's
a free download with in-app purchases so
it won't cost you anything to check it
out space camp is a fun little
application that kind of lets you paint
a 360 degrees fear with pictures from
your camera how it works is you start
with a blank sphere you then point your
camera at something and tap the app the
image will then appear on the inside of
the sphere you can move around and take
pictures this way and so you have a
really unique collage some have compared
this to Google's photosphere although
the two really aren't the same thing you
can try it out for free if you want to
