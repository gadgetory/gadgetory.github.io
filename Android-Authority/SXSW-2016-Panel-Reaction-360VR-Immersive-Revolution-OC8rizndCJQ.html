that was called live 360 video and VR
the immersive revolution essentially
dealing with the fact that 360 videos of
you think right now it's a revolution
that's happening and virtual reality is
going to allow for this incredible
immersion to happen when it comes to
live events and actually in the panel we
ended up talking about what they'd
rather ended up talking about current
events as well about journalism and how
360 video could probably be used as a
method to have people experience what is
otherwise a maybe cataclysmic event or
just some sort of really historical
event that's happening right then in
there so you feel like it kind of
democratizes a lot of events that
usually would come up at very exquisite
I think it provides an augment the
existing live streaming whether it's a
sports ooh you're at the NBA we stream
league the all-star game with with the
NBA and things like that it creates a
new perspective that rather than having
the camera moonshot you actually have a
shot that you're no courtside sitting
there and you're able to look around and
control your view it puts a whole new
perspective on the game live stream the
panel included a associate from riots a
gem duong who does a lot of VR stuff
after that you have Geoffrey Jacobs who
was part of a lot of the productions at
MTV that helped with red carpet vr 360
time deals especially for from live
streaming in second screen situations
and then miles McGovern who is with IM
360 which is a well-known of VR fold
Platt
a company that creates all of these
experiences via VR and 360 videos now
the interesting thing about 360 cameras
as they are becoming more common
especially with Samsung and LG bringing
out there there are 360 cameras is the
fact that these 360 cameras aren't
necessarily ones that you could just
start bringing everywhere with you you
have to sort of think about how the
immersive quality of 360 video is going
to make the audience connect with your
content ok guys the only way this works
we're just another schmuck putting the
cameras red carpet and just seeing what
happens because that 180 degrees is
boring 20 20 degrees in 20 degrees is
blackjack and scaffolding you know those
30 degrees is someone you don't want to
see the producer you'll want to see so
then we're doing all this work for 75
degrees point so a lot of the time the
content is going to have to change there
was one example that was given during
the Q&amp;amp;A that spoke about cirque du
soleil actually changing the entire
production so that they were doing
everything in the round and that
actually made a lot of sense because if
you're going to have the three the VR
goggles or even just the phone that
you're using to be able to go around the
various parts of the huge 360 frame then
you all have to have content catered
specifically to you or you're going to
have a whole of pretty much nothing
going on in one particular area it
wouldn't really make sense if you had
somebody just in front like this and
then everything behind them had no had
no purpose whatsoever Matthew you're
directing the audience
instead of you know putting a nice
clinking thing going look here so you do
this actor this actor it's kind of like
the natural thing that you're going to
be a part of told ya what I thought was
really interesting was that these 360
cameras have been used for a lot of
different occasions but it's only really
now that we're seeing VR and 360 be used
for live streaming events and in this
case didn't in one case there was the
NBA all-star game that was done just
then maybe a couple of months ago or a
month ago rather and there are a number
of red carpet events that are being used
for it also what Jeff in particular said
being the MTV person was that what he
thought was a successful VR experience
is that if you're seeing something right
in front of you we're able to turn
around and see the reactions of the
people that are in the audience that is
a successful platform for VR what's the
role of privacy of consent for 360 live
events I think most of the events that
we do you give up and give that up when
you buy your ticket you know it's
something that you consent to when you
buy your ticket at a sporting event or a
concert or something and you know we
also have wasteful walking things out of
doing things when it came to Myles
McGovern's thoughts about the Aria was
more on the technical side
especially considering that all of these
phones that we're using right now
including Samsung and this version right
here even though it doesn't use the
actual phone screen for the VR platform
is that the decoders for the for the
actual videos for the actual 360 videos
aren't necessarily catered to the high
bandwidth to the actual high amount of
data that's being used so the hurdle
right now is being able to create this
content and make it easy for all of the
people who have phones like this to be
able to actually digest it and then
finally as might be one of the main
points about VR right now one of the
biggest hurdles is the fact that VR is
not necessarily marketable it is
marketable it is an incredible
experience that you can tell people it's
an incredible experience but they won't
really buy into it until they actually
try it you've seen that happen with me
lon pretty much everybody at andrew
authority that is put on in particular
in HTC vive and that makes a lot of
sense it's until you actually do get to
experience it that you won't be able to
buy into this new system so I just
wanted to give you a quick reaction this
is finally the first panel that I was
able to attend when it comes to PR and
360 video and that's obviously going to
be a focus for us here currently a
tempered Authority for South by
Southwest so I want you guys to stay
tuned for that wise raised saw a couple
of demos in a couple of different places
especially from Samsung and one from HTC
as they partnered up with McDonald's of
all people and you will be able to see
some of that over the next few days so
make sure you tape to adhere to android
authority because we are your source for
all things South by Southwest</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
