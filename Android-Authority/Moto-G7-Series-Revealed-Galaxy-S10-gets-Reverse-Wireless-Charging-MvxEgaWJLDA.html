but it seems like most of you think it's
gonna be a merry moto Christmas because
so many of you seem to love the Moto G
Series leaks that's on Android authority
calm they're getting more retweets and
shares than anything else let's talk
about why Droid shout picked up the
renders and they potentially show off 4G
models the Moto G 7 g7 + g7 power and
finally the g7 play the g7 + g7 + would
apparently come with a water drop knotch
while the g7 play and g7 power would
have a wider notch it also appears that
the power and play would feature
vertically mounted dual rear camera
sensors while the standard and plus
models would have a horizontal camera
setup previous rumours suggested that
the Moto G 7 would pack a 6 inch full HD
+ display with 64 gigabytes of internal
storage a dual 16 megapixel + 5
megapixel camera setup is tipped for the
rear while it's also said to house a 35
hundred million power battery you can
expect the plus variant to have a larger
display the power variant to have a
larger battery and the play variant do
have slightly less power you see I
thought this will get a little bit more
traction but it's still early it may
take off there is an ad on Twitter that
oneplus put out of someone playing a
game on the oneplus 60
of course it doesn't really look like
the oneplus 16 now look at this photo
and then look at this photo which one is
the actual 1 + 60 now the one plus 60
does have a great display and really
thin bezels but if you were to look at a
recent advertisement from oneplus
promoting the 16 you might come home
disappointed after the purchase because
the oneplus 60 in the ad has a much
smaller bezel and nearly non-existent
chin compared to the actual 60 but
oneplus was called out on that by one of
our colleagues over to Android police
where he said hey oneplus the chin ain't
that small now good news for those of
you who are big fans of the pixels
camera app but don't have a pixel
because friends from my old stomping
grounds at XD developers have ported the
app to phones that you might have
xda-developers reports that developer
nova a g2 has whipped up a google cam
report for the honor play huawei mate 10
and the huawei mate 10 pro and yes the
version includes google's cutting-edge
nitesite mode
judging from the list of compatible
phones it looks like this latest port
target's devices with the kuren 970
chipset XD readers also reported that
the feature works with the likes of the
honor view 10 but sadly not yet
compatible with the Huawei P 20 pro and
this is really good news because now the
geeks and XD developers might have a
camera app that will inspire them to get
outside and finally some potentially
good news for all of us who care about
battery juice you see the huawei mate 20
pro delivered a great feature it's
called reverse wireless charging it
allows you to wirelessly charge other
gadgets with the phone now it's claimed
that the Samsung Galaxy 10 series could
offer that same feature word of
Samsung's flagship gaining this feature
came via Gizmodo UK last week setting a
source at a quote major tech retailer
the outlet added that the functionality
would be called power share less of a
mouthful then reverse wireless charging
now this leak was corroborated by Sam
Mobile saying that the name would
actually be power share which is much
better marketing and branding on
Samsung's part and if you remember a
couple weeks ago I talked about that if
Samsung had some new really pretty
killer feature that would matter to the
average viewer that that would be a big
push for Samsung and if they can explain
and market this idea to the average
viewer I think this could have a massive
impact I mean everyone's got multiple
charging cables and multiple devices
charging all the same time I mean I have
like two Power Bars at my desk to plug
everything in this could simplify that
process and be a power hub around what
is for most people their primary
electronic device let me know what you
think in the comments below or on
Twitter I still read all of them I just
don't comment all of them because I
don't want my brain to hurt but let me
know what you think right down there
have a great Merry Merry Christmas and
new here the next show is going to be
about phones coming out that have or
will have 10 gigabytes of RAM it's gonna
be a geeks dream I'm looking forward to
it watch it it's coming up soon
you know what software starts do things
it's not supposed to do who solves those
problems

teams in fact it's called incident
