Android authority and Samsung just
released another device into their a
series lineup that's bigger more
powerful and thinner but is it worth the
buy this is the samsung galaxy a8 so
this year Samsung finally decided to
completely ditch the use of plastic
going all-in with more premium materials
and a new design for their smartphones
and the galaxy a8 continues that trend
just like previous Samsung a series
devices the a8 utilizes a metal unibody
design and continues Samsung's move away
from practical features like removable
batteries in favor of a better build
quality Shefford edges go around the
entire metal frame and the body has been
mostly rounded off along the corners and
back with the exception of the sides
featuring some very prominent angles at
only five point nine millimeters thick
this is Samsung's thinnest smartphone
today and for a phone made entirely of
metal it manages to stay pretty light at
151 grams the a8 also carries some very
thin side bezels which helps make it
more manageable in one hand in terms of
width but it's still a rather tall phone
the metal build and super thin profile
of the a8 is an awesome combination but
despite how great it feels in the hand
it can still be pretty unwieldy at times
especially with such a large screen and
the smooth metal back is quite slippery
which makes the phone feel even less
secure during one-handed operation the
buttons and ports are in identical
locations to other galaxy a devices with
the power button comfortably placed on
the right micro USB and 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack on the bottom a single
speaker mounted on the rear next to the
camera and volume buttons on the left
but they're choked up extremely high on
the chassis making them very
uncomfortable and awkward to reach also
on the left are dual SIM card slots one
of which doubles as a micro SD card slot
for extra storage and of course a
Samsung device would not be complete
without the typical home button and
capacitive keys on the front the screen
on the AAA is a Super AMOLED panel that
measures in at 5.7 inches and the large
size makes it great for movies games web
browsing and pretty much anything else
you typically want to do on a phone it's
got all the characteristics that you
would expect from a Samsung made AMOLED
screen like great viewing angle
fools high brightness good outdoor
visibility and vibrant saturated colors
that makes the elements pop off the
screen
it's a 1080p panel which falls short of
the quad HD standard in today's current
crop of flagships but the AAA isn't a
flagship and most people will find 1080p
to be more than enough for a screen on a
phone there's still plenty of sharpness
and resolution to be had for a very
enjoyable experience when reading text
and various other content driving the
everyday performance is the Qualcomm
made Snapdragon 615 a pretty common
processor in the mid-range smartphone
market there's 2 gigs of ram on board
and general everyday performance was
pretty good and ran smoothly whether I
was multitasking browsing the web or
playing graphically intensive games it
does suffer from some home screen
stutters every now and then especially
when scrolling in and out of Flipboard
but this was also a problem on the
Galaxy s6 and Samsung hasn't done much
to alleviate that problem on the a8
otherwise the a8 handles itself well and
in the grand scheme of things the
performance is on par with other
smartphones that are similarly Specht
hardware wise the usual connectivity
options like Wi-Fi Bluetooth NFC and LTE
cat6 are all available but it does not
support 4G bands in the u.s. 3G data
speeds however work just fine on
t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T the am in either 16 or
32 gigs of storage with the option to
expand up to an additional 128 gigs to
store all of your media
samsung also brought the fingerprint
sensor of the s6 over to the a8 and it
seems to work just as well as it does on
the s6 unlocking the phone relatively
quickly the setup process is identical
utilizing a series of repeated presses
until it completely captures your
fingerprint and you can store up to a
maximum of four fingerprints at one time
speaker quality from the rear mounted
speaker isn't the best it doesn't get
very loud so it can be very tough to
hear in noisy environments and being
mounted on the rear certainly doesn't
make it any better it's also somewhat
tinny and hollow sounding so the media
experience is definitely lacking at
least when it comes to great sounding
audio despite how thin the a8 is Samsung
was able to pack a pretty large 3050
milliamp hour battery inside and battery
life has been really good having that
1080p Super AMOLED screen definitely
makes a difference here
the phone also idles extremely well
losing only between 2 to 3% overnight so
even with heavy usage of a lot of gaming
and YouTube watching I was still able to
squeeze out 4 hours of screen on time
with over a day's worth of standby time
simply because of how well the phone
idles now on a more normal day where I
mostly stuck to social media and web
browsing screen on time reached upwards
of almost 6 hours so whether you're a
heavy user or a light user you really
shouldn't have any problems with getting
through a full day on this device the
camera on the rear is a 16 megapixel
sensor just like the s6 but unlike the
s6 the AAA utilizes ISO cell technology
instead of a Sony sensor which means no
optical image stabilization but it does
carry an aperture of f1 the front camera
is a 5 megapixel wide-angle lens that's
actually capable of taking some pretty
decent selfies but the default beauty
setting is a little aggressive so you'll
want to tone it down if you prefer a
more natural looking image the camera
interface is mostly the same as what was
introduced on the s6 it's a much cleaner
more simplified UI with only a few
shooting modes like panorama continuous
shot night and a pro mode for full
manual controls coming pre-loaded but if
you were a fan of Samsung's many other
modes you do have the option to download
them all individually the main
difference is the absence of HDR auto
and the HDR toggle is buried within the
rest of the shooting modes making the
experience of switching back and forth
between HDR and auto mode a little bit
clunky and slow what isn't clunky and
slow is the shutter speed it's nice and
quick making it really easy to snap
photos and the resulting images are
quite good they're very sharp with
plenty of detail especially in
above-average lighting conditions and
there's still a good amount of clarity
even when zoomed in the images are
colorful and saturated as you would
expect from a Samsung camera making for
some very crisp and vibrant images
dynamic range is already pretty good as
is but HDR should you ever need it does
a great job at introducing some extra
detail and color without appearing
overexposed or unnatural even without oh
yes the camera does really well in low
light and the F 1.9 aperture obviously
makes a huge difference here images
still exhibit
amount of color and sharpness and
there's not a whole lot of noise
reduction going on which really helps
maintain a respectable level of detail
for the software the AAA is running the
typical TouchWiz interface on top of
android 5.1.1 lollipop this is the much
leaner more revamped version of TouchWiz
that we originally saw on the s6 so
there's a lot less Samsung bloatware and
unnecessary features but because this
particular review unit comes from SK
Telecom a carrier in Korea there's quite
a bit of SK Telecom apps pre-installed
most of which will probably be of no use
to anyone using this device elsewhere
Samsung's more popular and arguably more
useful features like multi window for
split screen multitasking and the smart
gestures like palm swipe to capture a
screenshot or flipping the phone over to
mute a phone call or alarm are all
available on the a8 the new themes
engine that was first introduced on the
s6 is also included on the AAA to help
you easily customize and change the
overall look of the UI if you're not a
fan of the blue and green TouchWiz color
scheme which I don't think very many
people are the theme store is constantly
growing and it's much more robust now
than it was during its initial inception
and with so many different styles you
should be able to find at least a few
that would suit your taste
the Galaxy AAA is currently available in
select markets like China India and
Korea and if the release of previous
a-series devices is any indication it is
highly unlikely that we'll see it coming
to the States
the cost to import one through sites
like eBay will run you upwards of $800
and at that point you're obviously
better off buying a flagship like the s6
or the LG g4 or a device like the idol 3
which offers a very comparable
experience for a fraction of the cost
overall the AAA is a solid mid-range
device that gets a lot of things right
like the build quality camera and
battery life but the price certainly
puts the AAA in no-man's land here in
2015 there's plenty of great mid-range
devices that are hitting the sub $300
price point and with flagships like the
Moto X style and oneplus 2 on the
horizon the AAA isn't exactly a bargain
by no means do I think anyone would
regret their purchase of the a8 but when
looking at the current smartphone
landscape the AAA is certainly one tough
pill to swallow
