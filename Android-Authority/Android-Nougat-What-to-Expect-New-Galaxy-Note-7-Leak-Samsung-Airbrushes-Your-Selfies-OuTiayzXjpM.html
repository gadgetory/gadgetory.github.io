up with Nutella due to copyright issues
but nougat really know yet now let's get
the pronunciation out of the way nougat
this is what I'm going with I know the
british and americans pronounce it
differently canadians probably do too
but right now I've done a survey of our
staff and I'm going with nougat so when
Google announced that Android n would
officially be known as Android nougat we
were wondering what the version number
would be and it is seven point oh now I
know what you're thinking Jase hold up a
second what is a nougat well it's a
candy made from sugar or honey nuts and
egg whites I was thinking maybe since we
had marshmallow last time maybe now we
were gonna have narshe mallow in its new
statue unveiling google confirmed that
android nougat is in fact a seven-point
over ssion of the operating system this
means a whole new version now the fact
that the new version of android is
getting a bump 27 point 0 shouldn't
really come as a surprise google has
told us a while ago that we could expect
a big release every year they didn't
specify whether or not that meant a full
digit jump every year but it looks like
that's what we're getting now we already
know that android seven point 0 is going
to give us more seamless updates better
battery life and better options for
android pay but what are you looking
forward to best next up Samsung thinks
you're not pretty enough in fact they
airbrush selfies automatically Mel Wells
is a UK health and fitness writer as
well as a popular Instagrammer and as
someone familiar with selfie snapping
she noticed something different when she
took pictures with her new Samsung
Galaxy s7 the front-facing camera
automatically obliterates all of her
freckles a little poking around led to
Wells discovering the beauty filter
although she says there isn't anything
intrinsically wrong with having such a
filter it did strike her as a bit exim
that the filter was turned on by default
in her own words and I quote this means
that everyone who gets a new samsung
phone and flicks the front camera on is
automatically being told hi we're
samsung and we think you look way better
when we automatically airbrush your
selfies for you does this bother you
let me know in the comments below but
first let's talk about the new Samsung
Galaxy Note press renders this picture
corresponds with a curved glass screen
protector made by elixir and showcases a
curved display a USB type-c port and of
course the three sensor arrangement used
for iris scanning which is curiously
missing from the image given to us by
evleaks published earlier last week one
particular point of note in these
renders is the seeming lack of three
lens raised above the display which puts
it in contrast with the leaked photo of
the front panel we exclusively revealed
earlier last week for those of you
looking for a quick specs summary you
can assume that the galaxy note 7 will
offer a five point seven or five point
eight inch quad HD Super AMOLED display
at Snapdragon 820 or an Exynos 88-90
three system-on-a-chip six gigabytes of
ram 64 128 or even 256 gigabytes of
internal storage microsd expansion a 12
megapixel rear camera with dual pixels
and a 5-megapixel front-facing camera a
3600 milliamp hour battery iris scanner
and the new grace UX running on top of
Android 6.0 play one marshmallow
