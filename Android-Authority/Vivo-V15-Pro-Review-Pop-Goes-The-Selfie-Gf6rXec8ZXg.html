the vivo V 15 pro with this elevating
front-facing camera so the first thing
you'll notice about the V 15 pro is this
ultra View display which means that
there's no bar at the top normally where
the earpiece would go in the
front-facing camera there's no chin at
the bottom it's got this display that
literally does go edge to edge we're
talking about a couple of millimeters of
bezels around the outside and the way
they've done that is by using this
elevating front-facing camera so they
don't need a space for it they're up at
the top and also there is an under
display a fingerprint reader so when you
put all that together you've got this
nice full view display and I must say in
the time I've been using this phone it
really is nice particularly I'm showing
photos to people and it takes up that
whole display and it really is a good
viewing experience that you have in your
hand on top of that it's a Super AMOLED
display so the colors are nice and
vibrant and those blacks are nice and
dark and it's got full HD plus
resolution which translates to 1080 by
2340 pixels so that's what's happening
on the front of the device what happens
when you flip it over well when you do
look at the rack of the device you see
this lovely color scheme they've got
going on here here got this nice blue
one but more importantly got this triple
camera system has a 48 megapixel sensor
for normal photos an 8 megapixel sensor
for wide shots and a 5 megapixel sensor
for depth information now we will talk
more about the camera in a little bit
but it does certainly take pride in
place here on the back of that device
unfortunately there is a camera bump
which means if you do type with the
phone on a flat surface then it will
rock as you're typing something
personally I am NOT very keen about in
the past when I've talked about phones
with camera bumped people have said well
of course if you put a case on it that
will solve the problem now you do get a
free case with this phone but ironically
it also has a camera bump so it doesn't
actually solve the wobbling problem when
you are tired
also the box you get a fast charger that
can do 18 watts as two amps at nine
volts you get a pair of headphones and
you get a USB cable and I'm sad to say
this phone uses a microUSB port so if
you've made a switch over to USB type-c
then this really is going to be a legacy
device for you taking a quick look round
the edges of the phone at the very top
of course you've got that elevating
selfie camera I'm pleased to say there
is a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
on the right hand side you've got the
power button and the volume keys on the
very bottom you've got that micro USB
port as I mentioned a moment ago you've
got a SIM tray that can also take an
micro SD card you have a single speaker
grille on the left hand side you have a
dedicated ai button which I talked more
about in a minute and you have a second
SIM tray so this seems to be one of
those rare phones where you can actually
use two Sims and you can actually use a
micro SD card all at the same time
although I must say I haven't actually
tried that let's talk about the camera
for a little bit now of course that main
sense is a 48 megapixel sensor however
if you read the small print you'll see
that actually it only produces 12
megapixel photos and that's because four
pixels are used together in a kind of a
super sampling way to actually just
produce one pixel on the actual photo so
it isn't really a 48 megapixel camera it
actually effectively a 12 megapixel
camera and that can actually drop as low
as 8 megapixels depending on the ratio
that you're using while you take the
photo overall I was very impressed by
the quality of the photos that came out
of the vivo v15 Pro particularly the
nighttime mode which actually used quite
a lot because I really was quite
impressed by the photos and the way it
works is if you take a photo in the
night shot mode then it will take a much
longer exposure maybe 5 seconds and it
will then Stitch all that information
together to bring out the extra light in
those photos they're kind of like HDR
for daytime but actually using it at
nighttime but the caveat is you do have
to keep the phone very very still so I
found the best results are when you're
kind of leaning up against something
maybe a window frame or kind of you know
a pillar or post or that kind of thing
it works very well you don't necessarily
need to use a tripod but you sir
they do need to keep it still but when
you do that those nighttime shots can
actually look pretty good as I think
there is this wide-angle shot and that
actually is very nice it's actually not
too wide you get any kind of barrel
distortion but it is good you can kind
of get a much bigger scene of what
you're taking particularly when you're
taking pictures of landscapes and be
able to really get the edges of that
photo so using the wide-angle shot was
also I was pleased with the results and
unfortunately I can't say the same about
the front-facing camera although that
nice pop up camera is very very nice to
watch is very very nice to see in action
and it says it's 32 megapixels actually
again they're using some kind of super
sampling here and you actually get 8
megapixels photos out of it and actually
when you do a bit of pixel peeping on
them you'll find the quality isn't that
good at all now as for the depth sensor
that's there so you can have that
artificial bokeh effect applied in
post-processing basically it's there to
kind of gauge how far away the subject
is and then you can see what's beyond
that and kind of a blot apply the
blurring unlike most of these systems
when it gets it right it's okay and when
it gets it wrong it just basically gets
it wrong as you can see from some of
these photos here even this picture of
me which it should be able to detect me
wearing a hat but even the hat there is
blurred when it shouldn't be there's
some stuff over my shoulder there that's
blurred that shouldn't be and again the
same when you apply this to objects
rather than people you can get mistakes
in the processing so when it works it
will work well but it can't be
guaranteed to come out as you expect the
good news is that actually this is
something you can do in post Pro so you
can change the depth so if you find it's
actually focusing things and it
shouldn't be or things right a focus it
shouldn't be you can actually just drop
down that bokeh effect and maybe bring
some things back into focus and kind of
save the picture the camera also
includes the jovi image recognition
system which allows you to take a
photograph of something or point the
camera at something and it will kind of
use some image recognition software to
tell you what's in that photo and it
looks like it brings up links for
shopping site so you can buy something
similar now sometimes it worked and
brought up links and for me even though
I'm in Europe it was bringing up links
for shops in Malaysia and sometimes it
would just say please connect to the
Internet and it doesn't didn't give you
any results even though I was connected
to the insect so it seems to be a bit
hit and miss and I'm not really sure of
its actual value really and that jovi
image recognition system can be
activated either when you're inside the
camera or actually by double tapping on
the hey I key on the left hand side of
the phone if you single tap on it or
long press on it you'll get Google
assistance so it's actually a nice way
of getting very quickly into Google er
system the good news is it can be
remapped in the settings let's talk a
few minutes about the internals of this
device it comes with the snapdragon 675
that's a very very recent processor from
coal comb and it uses to court it's a 76
cores and then six cortex a 55 cores and
it will be interesting to see how it
compares with the other high-end devices
in the 600 range and of course in the
700 range it also has the Adreno 6 1/2
GPU so actually it will be able to play
good games on it I've been able to play
things like Need for Speed without any
worries whatsoever however course you're
not going to get the same GPU
performance that you would get from
let's say a flagship device using a
Snapdragon 800 series processor let's
have a quick look at the benchmarks for
Geekbench single core there's a score of
2388 which actually makes this phone
faster a quinta geek and the snapdragon
835 may be something you'll find in a
pixel 2 for the multi-core score it's
actually 5535 it's actually slightly
less than what you're getting a
snapdragon 835 and then a test like
an-22 which also includes GPU and CPU
will give you a score of 170,000 102
which again is greater than something
like the pixel to the phone comes in
several different versions some have got
8 gigabytes of RAM some we've got 6
gigabytes of RAM the one I was using has
6 gigabytes of RAM and 128 megabytes of
internal storage
now Norway at this point I'd want to run
speed test G on this device to see how
it
unfortunately speedtest G won't run one
of the test crashes and I can't find out
why any actually works on every other
phone that I've tried except for this
VEVO V 15 Pro and talking to one of my
colleagues they also found another
benchmark tool that won't run on this
device so that's a bit sad particularly
since this has the snapdragon 675 in it
and I really would like to see how it
performs under speed test G but that
does lead me into the whole area of the
software the V 15 Pro does not use stock
Android it uses fun touch OS which while
based on Android 9.0 really is a heavy
skinned lots of things have been changed
including of course things that there's
no app draw all the settings have been
changed all the apps that are in there
are not any of the standard Android
stock apps they all come from fun touch
OS while you do get Google Play and a
lot of the Google apps pre-installed
most of the standard apps are actually
from this fun touch OS on top of that in
the first few days of using I really was
getting bombarded by a permission
requests even for the most simplest of
things the keyboard and the the kind of
the album min of the gallery and every
single app almost seemed to be asking me
for permissions and I thought
permissions that really weren't kind of
appropriate for what they were doing why
on earth is the gallery need these
permissions so that also secondly did
kind of alarm me slightly having said
that I haven't had any major crashes or
unexpected reboots
however fun touch OS really does need
some extra polish and some refinement to
bring up to the level of software that
we see today in stock Android and from
the other major OEMs and finally let's
talk about battery life it has a three
thousand seven hundred million power
battery which should be ample to get you
through a normal day of usage however I
have found that if you are a heavy game
player actually the battery drain can be
greater than you might assume for
example just playing gaming's you'll
find that the whole battery can be
drained in just about three and a half
hours which actually is that expected
from a battery of this size however if
you stay away from 3d gaming or you
don't play it very much then you should
be able to get through the day without
any problem even if you do need to
recharge the good news is though that
fast charging works
very well on this device so what does
that mean overall well there's a nice
hardware package here the display the
ultra view display is excellent the in
display fingerprint reader worked
flawlessly you've got nice colors you've
got nice blacks you've got a nice
processor in there the Snapdragon 6mm 5
good amount of memory an internal
storage the camera system on the back is
ok and does produce some reasonable
photos however the package is let down
overall by the software and that
elevating camera although it looks nice
when you see it going up and down
actually it doesn't produce the kind of
quality of selfie photos that I would be
expecting from this camera ok my name is
Gary Sims this is Andrew Authority I
really hope you enjoyed the video if you
did please do give it a thumbs up also
do check out the written review which
goes along with this video and you'll
find that on the Android or thority
website ok that's about it I see in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
