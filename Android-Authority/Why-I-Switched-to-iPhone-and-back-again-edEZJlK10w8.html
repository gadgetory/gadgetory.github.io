what's going on everybody and the title
you see below is actually half the story
this is why I switched to the iPhone and
then right back again okay in case you
guys don't really remember I actually
took the entire month of December off
before returning at CES but at the
beginning of that particular month I was
faced with a bit of a dilemma
I opened up my drawer where all of the
phones are that I currently have and I
thought I want to use one that I haven't
really used a lot in 2015 and there was
no phone that fit that description
better than the iPhone 6s now I actually
have never used an iPhone as my daily
driver for an extended period of time so
I thought one month was pretty good now
I've used this phone for a number of
comparisons but now I was actually going
to experience using it on the daily now
the thing about this phone is well we
make no bones about it here many of us
here at Android thority still concede
that this is a beautifully designed
phone it's kind of the only one of its
kind and pretty much every manufacturer
tries to take a few design elements here
and there some more than others that
said however I have the rose gold
Edition and I did ask the bosses over
here at Android authority if they got me
this one on purpose I will admit gold
yeah rose gold yeah pink yeah no though
now what I wanted to do was go to a
store and find a third-party accessory
to be able to personalize this phone
with but I actually got one before I
even headed out to the store and it was
from oneplus that's right the
third-party accessory lineup for the
iPhone 6s is actually so good that even
one plus an Android company created a
case for it and that became the case
that I used for the duration of the
month as far as the different features
go I did sort of underrate the silence
toggle that's found on the top left
corner I do usually keep my phone's on
silent because I wear smartwatches but
in this case I actually liked the
silence toggle because it muted pretty
much everything on the phone 3d touch is
a feature that while nice in order to
get to shortcuts for different
applications is not a feature that I
found all that useful ultimately if it
wasn't available on the iPhone 6s I
probably wanted have noticed by far the
biggest issue that I had with the iPhone
6s was battery life and I ended up
becoming one of those people at the end
of the day most days during December
where I was actually asking a
hey do you have a power cable or does
anybody have a charger or I more
commonly I was the person at the end of
the day that said while my phone's
almost dead that said however the
standby time on the iPhone 6s is
actually pretty great and if I had
enough of a charge I could leave the
phone sitting there and I wouldn't have
too much of a problem once I came back
to it but the thing was I was out in New
York and a couple of my friends actually
saw right through the disguise that I
put on to my iPhone 6s and they realized
that the Android authority guy is
actually using an iPhone and a couple of
my best friends actually threatened to
take a picture of me and post it on
social media so that all of you guys
would get mad at me well here's that
picture that they took and I still was
able to keep it covered with that
oneplus cover now speaking of pictures
the camera on the iPhone 6s was mostly a
standard experience I actually didn't
find too much that was better or worse
about this than plenty of other good
Android cameras out there and the reason
is because when the iPhone 6s camera is
doing pretty well it does actually quite
wonderfully pictures can come out really
detailed and have the right color depth
to them but lower light situations tend
to be just as bad also so I wouldn't
really say that the iPhone camera is any
better than any other good Android
cameras but I will say that the auto
mode being what you see is what you get
when it works really well then you're
good to go
I would prefer a manual mode though
because if the auto mode doesn't get
what I want then I can always tweak it
in a manual setting and then finally
there's the fingerprint reader now
honestly I do think that the fingerprint
reader on the iPhone 6s and 6s plus
happened to be some of the best ones
that are out there they rival that of
the Nexus 6p and I will put them pretty
much at the same place no matter how
quickly you remove your finger from the
home button it's always going to jump
right into the interface that's just
going to be something that you can rely
upon and it definitely was the case for
me the only thing I didn't like about it
was that when I used that shortcut it
turned the camera shortcut into a
useless feature so you might not be
surprised to know that I didn't have
that many problems using an iPhone 6s as
my daily driver but the main reason for
that is because I actually enjoyed cross
platforming I make sure that a lot of
the applications that I use can be used
in Android or iOS for example cloud
magic all I have to do is install cloud
magic sign into that account and all my
emails were synced I will say one
particular thing though Google Maps is
vastly better than Apple
that's just the way it is and it's much
more accurate and also it's not as hard
to navigate because I'm so used to the
Google Maps iteration but once I came
back to CES I came to one big
realization that when I got the Nexus 6p
back in my hand once laun finally
returned it to me when we met at CES
that customization takes on two
different let's say premises when it
comes to these two ecosystems in the one
case you have the iPhone which on the
inside is just icons just splashed
around the home screens and it actually
felt like a bit of a sterile experience
when you turn on the phone you know
exactly where the absent icons are going
to be half the time and it's really easy
to just get into the phone swipe around
hit the app and then you're good to go
meanwhile on Android you can actually
cater exactly where you want the apps to
be or you can rely on the app drawer so
there's always that little bit extra
that you are doing in order to make the
experience your own not to mention the
fact that once I got my Nexus 6p I was
able to get into the wallpapers actually
change what lockscreen was on there
change what launcher was on there even
and actually really intensely
personalize this particular device to
what I wanted when it comes to Android I
don't really like putting cases onto my
phone so customization has to come from
within and that's exactly what I do
meanwhile on the iPhone customization is
more of an external experience because
you have a lot of cases third-party
accessories are really like very robust
and there are so many of them out there
for the iPhone that you can actually
make your phone look different from
other people's on the outside on the
inside it's kind of a really ubiquitous
experience and that's kind of what iOS
was going for and they did achieve that
but that being said having the actual
customization and having my phone be
literally mine from the inside and out
if I wanted to is really what makes me
gravitate to Android and I know that's a
position that a lot of people have taken
but I got a real good sense of that in
the month of December when I use this as
my daily driver but ultimately when I
got back to my Android phone I got I was
really happy and I haven't looked back
since so keep it tuned to and row 34
even more especially our comparisons
using the iPhone 6s and 6s plus that way
you can see how it stacks up to Android
flagships in the game today and from
there you can keep it tuned to this
