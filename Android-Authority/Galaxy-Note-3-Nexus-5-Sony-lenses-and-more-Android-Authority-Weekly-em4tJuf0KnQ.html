brought to you by Jackthreads if you
head to sign up jack threads.com slash
android authority you can skip the
waitlist and sign up today we've got
some news about the samsung galaxy note
3 we have some camera phone developments
from Sony and Iron Men an HTC team up
hey it's Josh of a Garth manager
Authority what's going on everybody and
it's time for another dose of the week's
top Android news it's android authority
weekly as expected the samsung galaxy
note 3 rumors and speculation has begun
with Aoife and the unpacked part 2
Samsung events just a few weeks away
it's pretty safe to say that we can
expect a lot of this to happen in the
coming days first up sammobile reported
that there will be two versions of the
Galaxy Note 3 and that while most
markets will be getting the 32 gigabyte
model only some will be getting the 64
gigabyte version and the note 3 will be
over all the same dimensions as its
predecessor while packing a slightly
larger display at five point six eight
inches likely due to a slightly smaller
bezel sammobile then went on to report
that there will indeed be versions of
the note 3 that sport either the exitos
quad-core or the snapdragon 800
basically the LTE versions will get the
snapdragon 800 while the exitos
processor will get put on primarily 3g
handsets to be fair though this list of
countries for their release has not been
finalized yet other specifications that
were reported included a slightly bigger
battery and Android 4.3 built in this
development regarding Android 4.3 was
confirmed by a DLNA certification
website that listed at least the Korean
versions of the note 3 as coming with
the new version of Android built in
software usually doesn't get changed
between versions of phones so it's
pretty safe to say that we're just gonna
get Android 4.3 on the Galaxy Note 3 now
if we could just get our updates to the
other Samsung phones and other phones in
general that would be great all right so
a little while ago it was reported that
Robert Downey jr. was brought on by HTC
for a huge ad campaign well the first
product of what looks to be a two-year 1
billion dollar arrangement between Iron
Man and the phone company was released
this past week essentially our dj's
character is
set on figuring out what HTC could
really stand for they go through a
number of different variations like
hipster troll carwash and hold this cat
personally I found the commercial kind
of weird especially because Robert
Downey jr. felt a little tacked on he
didn't seem like he was really acting
out a character and his personality
honestly didn't really come out but if
we're playing the HTC game I thought of
a few after watching this commercial Oh
what the crap hate tall cabinets hide
the coke are you ready for more Nexus 5
rumors despite the back and forth that
we've seen from LG and Google more and
more sources or claiming that LG will
indeed be developing the update to the
nexus for a Chinese publication puts the
Nexus 5 at the same price point as the
nexus 4 at launch and while it will be
based on the LG g2 it will be entirely
similar 1080p resolution and a
Snapdragon 600 processor were also
rumored and then a publication from
Vietnam claimed that the nexus 5 will
actually pack the Snapdragon 800 that's
more like the LG g2 but it will be made
of glass and retain the general idea
that the original Nexus 4 had in design
we can pretty much expect more rumors
and speculation to come out in the
coming weeks for this phone that we're
all really eager to see wearable tech
seems to be gaining some steam and
samsung wants to get in on that action
apparently the unpacked event on
September for will include more than
just the Galaxy Note 3 the design patent
was unearthed detailing a SmartWatch in
development samo will let use the news
on what is supposedly going to be called
the samsung gear however these pictures
are only speculative renders but then we
got even more substantial news regarding
the Samsung gear this time from
Bloomberg apparently the gear will be
able to make calls surf the web and
handle emails all of which will be
powered by Android unlike these renders
pause it however there will be no
flexible displays now don't forget to
stay tuned because the unpacked event in
Berlin is on September for right before
Aoife and we're going to bring you all
of the news and announcements that
Samsung has in store in oh my god what
the hell is I've been growing out the
back of your phone news Sony is looking
to get into the high-end camera phone
game by quite literally attaching a
camera you
to the back of your xperia phone a legit
sony kit packing an 18-megapixel CMOS
sensor can piggyback on say your xperia
z and greatly enhance your pictures of
apparently strawberries at least as was
illustrated in this picture and yes
despite your continued disbelief these
units are actually real currently called
the qx100 or the QX line one of these
units reportedly include green control a
socket for tripod mounting and their own
shutter buttons they'll likely be
announced alongside the Sony I one in a
few weeks right before Aoife as well our
final story of the day comes from LG and
their return to the tablet game the
first clue on earth was a trademark
filing for the name the g pad and
according to tech blog it could be
coming a lot sooner than we think claims
include an eight point three inch
display capable of 1920 x 1200
resolution a quad-core processor and 2
gigabytes of ram the back will be made
of aluminum and supposedly will still be
pocketable while the report does seem
somewhat sudden we've known that LG has
been slated to bring some sort of tablet
to Aoife in berlin it looks like this
one could be it and it could be released
as soon as it is announced as always
