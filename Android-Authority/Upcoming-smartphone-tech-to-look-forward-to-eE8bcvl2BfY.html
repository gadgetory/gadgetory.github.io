deposit into the bank of geek cred
all right so every week favorite pastime
is to talk about the most exciting tech
that is right around the corner and
first up is foldable screens and I know
I know bendable flexible and foldable
screens have been touted as the next
best thing for seemingly forever and
there's obviously been a ton of talk
behind closed doors but now we have
actually tried a working prototype from
Lenovo and Samsung has also showed off
its stretchable display technology
earlier this year there have been many
rumors in lake regarding samsung galaxy
x foldable phone this year the latest
reports suggest an announcement sometime
in 2018 but after a number of dates
changed company insiders no longer seem
to know if this device is right around
the corner or will continue to remain on
the sidelines for another few years in
truth we've already seen early flexible
display ideas implemented than the likes
of the LG G flex and the G flex 2 and
Samsung's edge technology is based on
similar underlying principles even if
super bendy smartphones don't become a
thing stronger more flexible and drop
resistant displays are definitely going
to be a big thing for clumsy smartphone
owners like me now for those of you into
completely bezel s displays under the
screen fingerprint scanners are
important now singer print scanners and
physical home buttons are two of the
first things that have to be sacrificed
for more screen real estate but in and
under the screen solutions are being
developed when it comes to fingerprint
scanners now many people were
disappointed that the under the screen
fingerprint scanner technology was not
implemented in the galaxy s 8 and it's
now of course on the back and not the
great placement and it looks like if
rumors are accurate that it won't be
implemented in the Galaxy Note 8 either
now next up is a new technology that
doesn't get much airplay and that's zoom
lens cameras dual camera technology hit
mainstream last year with a number of
flagship mid-tier and even budget
oriented model supporting a variety of
configurations while some dual camera
setups aim to improve image quality and
offer up new shooting modes the other
trend we've seen
dotted by a few manufacturers is their
use of improved zoom functionality
telephoto lenses have been available as
third-party smartphone accessories for a
while now but they're often a bit
inconvenient to carry around with you
both Apple and Oppo have shown that this
technology can be packed down inside a
smartphone with the iPhone 7 plus opal
r11 and the one plus 5 all boasting 2
times zoom capabilities even if not all
two time optical zoom however rumors
have reported that Samsung may bring its
own three time optical zoom to the
Galaxy Note 8 kora photonics has
repeatedly shown off its three time
implementation and can also supposedly
reach five time optical zoom now next up
is something that I think is pretty cool
and that's VPS indoor navigation now we
all use GPS navigation for picking out
driving routes and finding destinations
but a similar technology could be useful
for indoor navigation too at Google i/o
2017 the company unveiled its augmented
reality VPS indoor navigation technology
that will be enabled on tango equipped
phones the idea is that large shops
businesses or warehouses can provide
layouts of various products or important
indoor locations which tango users can
then use to navigate to desired items
for purchase or other indoor locations
easily VPS uses a combination of
computer vision machine learning and
mapping coordinates to figure out the
users location and route to their
destination even in areas where GPS or
data signal may be lacking know for
those of you who watch me all the time
know that I'm a little bearish on
virtual reality but augmented reality
that's a different thing looking again
to Google's tango platform we can see a
range of possibilities from sightseeing
and education with Google expeditions
through to clothes and virtual shopping
mapping an entire room complete with
textures in just seconds unfortunately
this technology is still probably two or
three years away from mainstream
commercial viability but if these
capabilities were mainstream already
people would probably use these apps
without a second thought you only have
to look at pokemon go and snapchat
filters to see that people love
augmented reality and they're willing to
use them
all the time and there are almost
endless commercial applications for
augmented reality as opposed to a
complete virtual reality now of course
related to that is adaptive displays now
if mented reality are really to take off
then variable refresh displays which
some manufacturers call adaptive
displays is going to be key by thinking
the GPU output to a displays refresh
rate screen tearing issues that can
appear when performance temporarily
drops or is removed and a smoother more
consistent looking framerate helps avoid
nausea in VR even outside of virtual
reality
variable refresh displays can have a
number of benefits for mobile high
refresh rates can make animations look
smoother and UI elements feel a tad more
responsive as well as improving the
fluidity of games and video at the same
time reducing the display refresh rate
when the UI is static can help save on
battery life as pixels don't have to be
updated as often so what are you looking
forward to right around the corner and I
know there's things you can get excited
about that are 5 10 years down the road
I know I do but I'm talking about stuff
that's like 18 months just around the
corner stuff that we will be able to use
and talk about right here very soon
let me know what you think in the
comments below or on Twitter now if you
are a developer or an aspiring developer
code is your world you create it tweak
it and lovingly obsess over it so
picking the right repository management
tool is super important that's why our
sponsor at Atlassian created bitbucket
bitbucket is the git solution for
professional teams helping over 5
million developers build with a purpose

world's best pulled request algorithm
built in continuous delivery and
integrations with your favorite tools
like docker AWS and Azure and because
bitbucket comes from Atlassian you get
the best JIRA integration available
bitbucket is for the code that takes us
to Mars decodes the human genome or
drives your next car visit bitbucket org
forward slash for the code to start your
free account
that's bitbucket org
