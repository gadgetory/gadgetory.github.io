with Android authority you're watching
our video review of honors $400
affordable flagship beyond our eight so
to kick things off the NRA features an
absolutely gorgeous design one that
easily rivals the galaxy s7 s level of
premiumness and yeah it looks a little
similar to the s7 and strikingly so to
that shell meanie for us but it's dual
glass panel design is still quite
remarkable there's actually fifteen
panels of light refracting glass here
which are what creates such enthralling
light patterns both the front and back
glass panels also curved down to meet
with a sham pert aluminum band so it
feels like you're holding a single piece
of hardware one really cool feature that
a lot of manufacturers exclude
especially at this price is an IR
blaster for controlling TVs or other
household appliances I was pleasantly
surprised that the honor included one at
this price Deana rates glass bag can be
quite slippery
mostly when sit down on something like a
couch cushion it slowly slips and slides
like an ice cube which resulted in a few
accidental Falls the good news is that
build quality seems quite strong a case
still want to be a bad idea though is it
would also help cover up any
fingerprints on the back of the device
while way plans to release a few cases
of their own - so one of those will
probably be your best bet although I
would have preferred capacitive keys in
place of the honor chin branding the on
screen navigation keys are so pleasant
to use they're also customizable so you
don't have to settle on the back button
being placed on what you perceive is the
wrong side
the nr8 has a 5.2 inch LTPS display with
saturated and punchy colors it's not
very color accurate however and you'll
want to adjust the color temperature in
the settings to something warmer so the
lights don't look so blue sunlight
readability is decent and the brightness
maxes out at 455 nits viewing angles
could be a bit better but overall this
is still a fairly good display this is
actually one of the few affordable
flagships that has a display smaller
than 5.5 inches so the an irate offers
an expectedly better handling experience
this could really be a major selling
point on its own if you're looking for
something more compact performance with
the honor eight was absolutely excellent
one of Huawei's own in-house processors
the high silicon Kirin 950 it's pretty
comparable to the Snapdragon 820 and
with 4 gigabytes of RAM everything is
buttery smooth and responsive now for
the GPU we're looking at arms malli t8
80 MP 4 it's good enough for virtually
every game out there but it may not be
as future-proof at something like the
Adreno 530 the an r8 is unlocked with
dual sim support and works with AT&amp;amp;T
t-mobile and the respective NVA knows
there's also been 12 LTE on board for
t-mobile's extended range LTE coverage
instead of using a second SIM card you
can insert a microSD card up to 128
gigabytes if you run out of the phone's
32 gigabytes of base storage this is
really a great option to have and it's
hard to imagine why some competing
options exclude this feature on the
bottom you'll find a USB type-c port
accompanied by a headphone jack on the
left and a single speaker on the right
this speaker is decent it gets the job
done for sure but the audio output is
hollow and distorted while Way has done
something a bit unique with the
fingerprint reader on the back of the
honor 8 it not only functions as a quick
and easy way to authenticate but also as
a tactile smart key you can set it to
different shortcuts including flashlight
screenshot or voice recording to tap
double tap and hold you can also have it
open in and up instead if you'd like
it's overall very clever and nice once
you get it set up how you like
sadly battery life isn't as good as I
would have liked as the 3000 milliamp
hour battery was only capable of
achieving about three and a half hours
of screen on time that's not terrible
but it's not quite up there with the xn
sevens five and a half hours or even the
one plus three is four hours it does
support 9 volt 2 amp fast charging with
the factory supplied charger for about a
42% charge in 30 minutes it doesn't work
with other 2 amp third-party chargers
though which really reduces its utility
honor has informed us that they'll be
selling compatible chargers online
directly to consumers soon pretty much
every affordable flagship fall short
when it comes to the camera thankfully
this isn't the case with the honor 8 as
the 12 megapixel dual camera
configuration with an F 2.2 aperture
produces some great images and about
that dual lens setup one of the lens
captures color while the other is
monochrome while we say it's that this
setup helps the
caPSURE crispier that are looking photos
objectively speaking images taken with
the honor a dark contrast a sharp and
showcase exceptional dynamic range it's
really impressive how well the phone can
balance the highlights and the shadows
low-light performance is strong as well
offering shots that are good enough for
most scenarios
well this camera is now going to
outperform the galaxy s7 it's amazing
what Huawei was able to do once you
consider the phone's price video
recording is a weak point though as it
maxes out at 1080p at 60 frames per
second colors also aren't that great in
video and the software stabilization is
no match for proper optical image
stabilization the camera app is decent
and the manual mode is impressively
comprehensive certain areas are a bit
frustrating though and a perfect example
of this is how the manual controls don't
rotate when you switch to landscape
orientation beyond rate is running
Huawei's emotion UI 4.1 over Android 6.0
marshmallow but it's very different from
stock Android there's no app drawer the
UI is iowa's like and there are a number
of additions many of which will polarize
opinion some of these additions are nice
and genuinely useful but they can
certainly come across as gimmicky for
instance while the knuckle gestures seem
cool and theory they don't always work
very well for what it's worth I do find
that lock screen view refreshing the
timeline notifications are kind of cool
and the power management tools are quite
useful what you don't usually get from
smartphone manufacturers is a solid
software commitment honor is different
though and as promised updates for at
least two years with new features every
three months for the first year
hopefully while we can improve the
software experience further with these
updates the recently announced
partnership with xda-developers is also
quite exciting is it aims to create
developer interest in the Anor 8 well
it's currently difficult to say whether
we'll eventually see custom roms for
this phone this is certainly a step in
the right direction you can pre-order
the honor 8 now and either blue black or
white from various retailers starting at
$400 for the 32 gigabyte model and $450
for the 64 gigabyte model there are a
number of promotional offers available
too including a $50 gift card which can
certainly sweeten the deal honor is
offering a free one-time glass
replacement within the first three
months if you register your honor 8 this
is a great bonus to have even
it is only for three months the nra
includes features that many have wanted
from an affordable flagship for a while
now a gorgeous design a smaller size and
a great camera
it's excellent performance good display
an IR blaster are also great attributes
since this is a very competitive price
segment you have a lot of options to
choose from therefore it would be wise
to consider what you value most net
smartphone and base your decision off of
that thank you so much for watching our
