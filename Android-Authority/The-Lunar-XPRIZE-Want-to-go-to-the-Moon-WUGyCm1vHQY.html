billions of dollars well it's all about
research and in this case we're talking
about research on the moon so what
exactly is the Lunar XPrize well the
Lunar XPrize is a competition in which
16 teams will try to land a rover on the
moon the team whose Rover covers the
farthest distance on the surface of the
moon will win of course the rover also
needs to record and transmit HD footage
at least 720p of their exploits on the
rocky surface of the moon but I hear
you're already asking how big of the
stakes well the grand prize is a cool 20
million dollars with a runner up taking
5 million dollars to put this into
perspective the previous contests that
Google had was for only 1 million
dollars and deepmind one that deep mind
is owned by Google so Google got to keep
their own money now let's talk about the
rules the rules of the contest only
allow for ten percent in government
funding for research and development
this is probably to ensure that the
competition remains as independent and
balanced as it can be other rules
include notifying Google of your
attempted launch and landing dates your
Rover also needs to cover at least 500
meters on the moon and should carry one
percent of its weight the team also
needs to send out at least a hundred
kilobytes of data and receive the
transmission of HD footage recorded on
the moon by the rover all of this needs
to be completed by the end of 2017 now
competitors are coming from all over the
world we have United States Canada Chile
Malaysia India Brazil hungry all over
the place and one of the teams that
caught our eye was a German team that's
partnered with the highly innovative
automotive giant Audi to design what
they're calling the lunar Quattro it
looks like Audi is taking this
competition seriously as it's planning
to be the first luxury brand on the moon
now which company will be the first
smartphone brand on the moon let's watch
for that now what's really exciting here
is that the Lunar X competition could be
one of the best stepping stones towards
achieving the dream of lunar
colonization perhaps when one day we use
a Google App to navigate to the surface
of the Moon will remember the Lunar X
competition is one of the projects that
pioneered this
into a reality now if you really want to
geek out we got to talk about machine
learning and what it could do for the
Lunar X competition machine learning
will play a big role for lunar Rovers as
well as similar robots that are sent to
hostile environments here on earth on a
related note a recent study published in
nature shows how machines can recover
from damage without any help from humans
this is the kind of thing Android robots
are going to need to be able to do in
the future if they are to survive in
hostile environments where it's just too
dangerous for human beings look at this
one here it is acting like a wounded
animal it's going to be able to maneuver
into places that humans just can't go
the possibilities are really exciting
and endless what do you guys think let
me know in the comments below well maybe
you're now one of those people who don't
want to just watch videos about
technology but help actually make new
technology while our beloved sponsor
full sail university offers degree
programs to help you reach those goals
in their mobile development
undergraduate degree program you'll
learn how to create and distribute apps
and if you're ready to advance your
development skills check out the mobile
gaming graduate program if you're ready
to compete in this rapidly growing
industry visit Full Sail edu /a thority
