Authority what's going on everybody and
every photo and video that you're seeing
in this camera shootout was taken on the
cameras of the Oppo find 7 a so am I've
taken a little bit but here is the Oppo
find 7 a camera shootout for your
viewing pleasure what we have here are a
lot of photos from my adventures over
the last month or so to be able to show
you the quality of this camera now as
far as specs ago this is a 13 megapixel
camera that we're shooting with here but
I took all of these photos at the full
auto mode with 10 megapixels being the
size of these photos because it crops
down in order to create the 16 by 9
aspect ratio that I always shoot with or
tried to shoot with at least in this
case we're taking a look at some midday
photos there was some cloud cover at
this brewery in Beijing that I ended up
going to with some friends and you'll
see a lot of photos and the crops of the
various food and the drink that we ended
up having as far as the quality goes I
will start with the color reproduction
it is not quite as saturated as some of
the other cameras that you might be
seeing there but actually it's a bit of
a strong suit for it as it does do a
good job of recreating the scene exactly
the way that it should be the saturation
is not so high in this case that the
colors look fake but it's also not so
low that you get a dull picture and as
far as the details go you do have quite
a bit of detail and plenty of the photos
here as we zoom into this picture of the
peanuts there and you can see that
plenty of the detail is there but there
is a little bit of grain on there which
is to be expected as this was a mid day
photo I do have a low-light shot right
here to show you the quality of that it
looks pretty good and we'll get to the
rest in a little bit
alright moving on here are some pictures
from a time when I went out with my
friends and we went to a great taco
place in downtown LA now these are
indoor pictures and I wanted to show
these to you to kind of give you the
middle path so it's not quite going to
be like the full broad daylight photos
where the detail would probably be very
good anyway or the low-light shots where
we would expect all the grain but as you
can see from this 100 crop right here
the detail is pretty good but it's not
quite the sharpest once you get into the
100 crops and then all of the tacos that
we ate um you'll be seeing those
pictures so I might be making you a
little bit hungry right now but this is
an example of what let's say a foodie
would end up doing if they had this
camera zooming into the taco right here
there's a little bit of a loss of detail
there but as you can see we do move
along and we do get some pretty good
photos here so if you're an instagramer
that really likes to take photos of the
food that you eat and that's pretty much
what your entire Instagram feed is then
the opal find 7a does do a good job of
capturing it even in this indoor shots
where pretty much we didn't have too
much light in order to really capture
all of that detail so just a few more
pictures here and you'll see in the
videos that I was actually taking all of
the videos at 4k but the following video
that you're about to see was from the
front facing camera that was taken at
720p resolution and you'll see what that
looks like if you happen to be a bit of
a vlogger
oh my god
that's so tasty though now one of the
features of the Oppo find 7 is camera
software is the ability to create 50
megapixel photos now essentially what it
does is it takes a lot of the same photo
pieces them together so that when you
create that large 50 megapixel file in
the end it takes some of the detail from
each and every one of those photos and
pieces it together to create that photo
without much loss of fidelity if at all
and we're going to take a look at it in
a little bit so I'm gonna start off with
the 16 by 9 aspect ratio 10 megapixel
photo which is right here and when we do
the 100 crop you'll see since it's out
in broad daylight we have a lot of the
details still there now of course what
the 50 megapixel picture that's coming
up right now
in order for me to give a comparable
look at the quality in the crop I had to
scale it in a lot farther because the
actual photo is a very large I 50
megapixels but you can see here that the
details still there and if we compare
the two you'll see that there is not
much loss from one to the other which i
think is the main takeaway of the 50
megapixel capability it is the fact that
if you really did want to have that
large large photo then you still would
be able to get it it will take a little
while for it to process at the actual
time of shooting but the resulting image
will not lose much detail comparatively
to the original photo I think that's the
main takeaway it's not meant to give
even more detail in the photos it's
meant to give a comparable amount
compared to the original and still be
usable
and finally for some final low-light
shots I did bring this camera out to
that childish gambino concert as well
and you'll be able to see here that the
sharpness does take quite a bit of a
dive as you'll see all of the grain in
these photos but that's something that
we would have expected already in these
very low light situations I also do have
a bit of a video there and it will be a
part of the 4k video sample that you can
see by linking onto the side on the Left
