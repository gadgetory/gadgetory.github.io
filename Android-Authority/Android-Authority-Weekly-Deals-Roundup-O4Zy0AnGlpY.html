Hindy from android authority calm and if
you're looking for some deals you're in
the right place our first deal is for
you beginner Android developers out
there who want to learn how to code for
a limited time you can get a development
course that teaches you the basics of
Android development for thirty-nine
dollars through you to me it comes with
74 lectures and if you're not familiar
with you to me we'll have our review of
their mobile app linked in the video
description below next up is three years
of VPN services from VPN unlimited for
$19 those who use VPNs often can all
testify as to how useful these things
can be to keep you safe while browsing
in public places like coffee shops and
airports it's also pretty nifty when
surfing at home these kinds of services
can get rather expensive over time and
if you buy this one you won't have to
worry about it again for three years if
you're looking for an external battery
pack you can pick up a 15,000 milliamp
hour lime fueled light battery pack for
$35 these usually retail on amazon for
over fifty dollars and an external
battery pack can come in handy in a
variety of situations especially during
camping trips and power outages it's a
USB charger so it's compatible with
pretty much any mobile device once again
