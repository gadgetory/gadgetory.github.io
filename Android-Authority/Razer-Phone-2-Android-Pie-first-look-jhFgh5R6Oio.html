handy from Android Authority comm and
the razor phone 2 is getting its Android
Pi update in the very near future but
Razer sent us a copy to play with so we
thought we would show you around so here
is the razor phone 2 with Android Pi
visual changes is as good of a place to
start as any
the update doesn't change all that much
in terms of visuals in fact most of the
stuff is in the same place as it was in
Android Oreo however there are a couple
of notable changes the first is the
introduction of Android PI's swipe
gestures the recent apps button is gone
and you can now swipe up to access both
the app drawer and the recent apps Razer
did Institute a small change to the
system though in stock Android you have
swipe up to access the recent apps and
then full swipe up to access the app
drawer however on the razor phone you
swipe up from the soft key area to
access the recent apps and then swipe up
on the dock area to access the app
drawer it's a small change but I
personally think this is way better than
the way stock Android does it you can of
course turn it all off by going into the
settings thin system then - gestures and
then turn off these swipe from the home
button setting to go back to the
old-school soft key formats about the
only other noticeable visual change
belongs to the settings menu
it has larger more colorful icons with a
more material design aesthetic some may
like it and some may not but it's there
to stay of course the razor phones who
is getting all of the under the hood
changes that come with Android Pi that
includes hallmark features like digital
well being adaptive battery and other
Android PI goodies as far as we can tell
Razer didn't add any new features that
didn't already come packaged with the OS
updates but Razer certainly didn't
remove anything either we're not going
to reinvent the wheel in this one if you
want to check out all of the under the
hood changes in Android Pi we have our
hands on video linked up in the video
description below or you can click on
that little banner at the top there
we've had the update for only about a
day or two so we didn't get to do a
whole lot of testing we tried a few
games messed around with the UI and even
popped in a SIM card to make a few phone
calls some features like adaptive
battery take much longer than a couple
of days to start showing real
differences however from what we can
tell everything seems to be working just
fine in fact the only major difference
in terms of usability are the colourful
settings menu and the digital well-being
app along with the new homescreen
gestures of course that's certainly not
a bad thing it's nice to have some
consistency anyway things look
on this end we didn't have any problems
with this update and neither should you
well that's all the information we have
about the update itself so let's talk
about when you can expect it to roll out
the unlocked version of the razor phone
- should receive the update on February
27th while the carrier version is
getting the update on March 13th
unfortunately AT&amp;amp;T folks have to wait
until April 4th and both AT&amp;amp;T and
carrier updates are subject to change
depending on how long it takes the
carriers to test and roll out the update
and that about does it for this one
folks if you like this video you know
what to do and if not you still know
what to do we have the written version
in the video description below along
with our Android Pi video if you want to
see those as always thanks for watching
everybody and have a wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
