authority now you've probably used your
smartphone quite a lot for taking photos
you probably just get out of your pocket
and you point and shoot it takes a photo
and it's all done automatically what's
interesting though is that a lot of
smartphones now include a manual mode on
the camera particularly at the high end
so the question before stays how do you
take a picture using manual mode on your
smartphone well let me explain now
finding manual mode is different on
every camera on some cameras tucked away
amongst the other modes like time-lapse
&amp;amp; panorama and slo-mo and there'll be
one mode they're called either
professional mode or manual mode you
just tap on that mode an extra set of
controls will appear on the screen on
some cameras it's actually always on the
screen just hidden away just a slide up
or slide to the side and these extra
controls will appear when you slide them
away again everything will go back to
being on automatic now to understand how
to take a picture with manual mode you
need to understand what these controls
do now the first control to talk about
is called metering mode now taking a
photo is all about light how much light
is coming into the sensor now obviously
if you're outdoors in bright sunlight or
if you're indoors in a restaurant there
is a difference to amount of light
that's coming into the sensor and so the
camera has to measure that amount of
light and that's called metering the
metering mode now the standard metering
mode is called matrix metering where the
whole frame is used and the average
light is taken across the whole frame
has an amount of light coming into the
camera from this if you have a bright
source like a a light from on the
ceiling or the sun shining in and it's
inside the frame that can actually
distort the amount of light that the
camera thinks is coming in so therefore
you have an option to pick different
types of metering mode and one of them
is called your spot metering where you
just literally it just said one spot the
center spot is where it's going to
measure the light and that's useful when
you want to exclude bright light sources
from other areas of the frame even
better is what's called center
where it's not just a scent of spot but
actually just the stuff in the middle
maybe for taking the port trait using a
photo of something just the light that's
available on that thing that you're
taking and my favorite is tap metering
we were actually able to tap on your
touch screen and you say to the phone
where I've tapped that's where I want
you to measure the light source and
that's good for tapping on someone or
something in a photo that's not quite in
the center maybe you're taking antistick
short and you want the light on
someone's portrait to the left but you
want to capture something else in the
rest of the frame or for bringing out
the detail is something that's maybe in
a part of the shade now the next thing
you should play around with is the
shutter speed now back in the days or
film there was and today with a DSLR
camera there's actually a physical
shutter that would open up for a
fraction of a second let the light in
and then close down again and how long
that shutter is open depends on how much
light can go in now on a smartphone
there's not an actual shutter it's done
using the same thing activated for a
fraction of a second and then dis
activated so it's on and then off and
how long it on for is how much light is
coming into the photo now with as far
shutter speed you can capture action
really really well as if you're
capturing sports a football we're
capturing a racing car or you're
capturing it's a you know a child doing
something interesting or a dog shaking
water off itself then having a far
shutter speed means that you capped you
free as a moment perfectly with clarity
in just a fraction of a second at the
other end you have a slow shutter speed
which means the shutter speed is open
for a long time and that will actually
add some different effects example it
might add some blur so I'm going to
running with a football or a car is
going par you can actually get that
sense of motion by including a slight
bit of motion blur with it it's also
good at night times you want to take
pictures of car taillights as they're
going down the road you can leave the
shutter open for a longer period of time
and get those red streaks and to capture
some artistic photos like that it's also
good with water if you want to take
water coming over a waterfall and use a
slow shutter speed you get a silky
effect of the water and it kind of adds
that motion blur to the wall
cascading over the edge now the problem
with shutter speed is when you go for
slow shutter speed you also introduced
the problem camera shake no matter how
how they do you think you're holding
your mobile phone you are actually
slightly moving it and all that motion
of you moving actioning it items those
not the motion of the subject moving but
your movement and that makes the whole
thing become blurry so if you're using
slow shutter speeds you really do need
to use a tripod now the companion of
shutter speed is the ISO speed now back
in the old days when it was actual film
the film actually had to have a rating
to say how quickly it reacts to light
now there were various different
standards over the years from different
manufacturers in the end the
international standards organization ISO
actually came up with a scale to say how
fast film reacts and the scale is
logarithmic so iso 200 is twice as part
of iso 100 iso 400 is twice as fast as
200 800 times 400 and so on now we've
used that same idea even into digital
photography and it basically tells you
how sensitive the sensor is going to be
to capturing the light now the problem
with high ISO numbers is is it they
issues a lot of noise because the sense
of trying really hard to capture that
light very very quickly it sometimes
doesn't do it very well and it
introduced specs and and it's a very
noisy picture is not a uniform color on
the picture so in general for good
quality you need lower ISO speed but of
course light is the key here you can't
use a low ISO speed inside of a
restaurant or in indoor photo there are
a few other things you can play with one
of these white balance or white light
sources have an amount of different
colors in them white accords made up of
a combination of all the colors if
you're looking at something like candle
light that's got that red warm glow to
it if you're looking at something maybe
like a flash from the camera that has
maybe a much brighter harsher light to
it and a salon sunlight of course is
there in the middle and white balance
tries to compensate so the white still
look good so by in a dark candle lit red
kind of environment the camera might I
tend to blue to the white to kinda
balance them out and that's the white
balance and you can basically non-auto
the camera measure the amount of white
and kind of has a guess of what's going
on or you can set it to cloudy flash
tungsten candle light and the camera
will kind of add in its own kind of tint
to compensate for that from some
third-party camera apps you can also set
the white balance so you point there
both the camera act at a white sheet of
paper in the lighting conditions you say
that is white and the camera will
compensate so that white looks bright
white in that particular environment now
how quickly you play with one is manual
focus you can actually sort of control
the focus like you would on the manual
focus ring on a camera I found that
quite difficult to use I still find
either using touch focusing or automatic
focusing better but it's there if you
really want to persevere to take a
particular type of shot and the other
thing exposure compensation basically
rather than having to fiddle with the
shutter speed and with the ISO speed you
can just say I'd like this to be double
the exposure or half the exposure and
use the evey number minus 1 or plus 1
minus 2 plus 2 which gives you double
each time the amount of exposure or less
exposure and you can actually use that
for doing your own manual HDR
photography you can take one at - Evi
one one at 0 1 + E V and therefore you
get these three two exposures dark in
the middle and bright light and then you
can combine them into get together in
software on your desktop there's very
different applications that you can
download and that will combine them
together to give you manual HDR in fact
some third-party camera apps will do any
bracketing which means automatically it
will take three photos or even five
photos at different exposure settings
when you take those afterward and you
combine them together on your desktop to
give you that that HDR manual HDR mode
so what's my advice for taking a shot in
manual mode basically don't do
everything on manual leave most things
on automatic and then play with one of
the controls the first one you want to
play with is shutter speed and see what
different effects you get by using a far
shutter speed and by using a slow
shutter speed you might also they want
to play around with the white balance
and of course if you're into doing
manual HDR you can play
with the exposure compensation but if
you want to do all of them
then really go and buy yourself a
digital SLR camera because that's really
the best way to do that but on your
smartphone playing around one of those
controls can actually give you some
interesting results I'm going to
inframan your authority I hope you
enjoyed this video please go tell me in
the comment if you ever use manual mode
are you going to try and use manual mode
and have you had any success with it
