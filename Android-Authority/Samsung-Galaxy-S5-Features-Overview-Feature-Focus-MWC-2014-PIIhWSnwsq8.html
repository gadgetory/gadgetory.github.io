by bitdefender mobile security hey it's
Josh regard from Android 30 what's going
on everybody and Here I am again with
the Samsung Galaxy s5 to bring you a
software feature focus there is been
there has been an update to the TouchWiz
on the Samsung Galaxy s5 and whether or
not it was the update you were looking
for is well something that's gonna be up
to you but I did want to showcase all of
the new features that are in here there
is a new homescreen a second screen that
is added on and that is the my magazine
my magazine much like Google now or
blink feed on HTC devices is now a
second screen all the way on the left of
your home screens and essentially what
this is is it's a simple hub that takes
the my magazine screen from the previous
galaxy note 3 and puts it in the
forefront allowing you to get easy
access to social media
highlights news highlights as far as the
design goes we basically just have the
tiles I go across the entire screen and
the pretty much just shows you the
headline along with the picture just for
nice viewing now this is the thing about
the my magazine is that all the sources
are rather curated so you're not going
to be able to add in your own sources
and your own news sources in order to
get that information you'll have to look
through in this particular list
including this list of social media like
Google+ and tumblr and YouTube in order
to get those pieces of news but up here
they're just very specific categories
and you'll get news stories based on
those only one of the big changes that
happened is there's a more circle
centric design as you can see up here
with the quick toggles in the
notification drop-down if I bring down
all of the new toggles you'll see that
everything is pretty much a circle right
here and it keeps things pretty
simplistic it gives it the same motif
all around and it's actually pretty nice
one other place that you'll see that
change is right over here in the
settings the actual setting page itself
has been changed quite drastically and
is now just a long drop-down with menus
that can be collapsed
like this in order for you to easily get
to the various settings that you want
this is different from the side-to-side
tabbed interface that was on not only
the Samsung Galaxy S line but also
across a lot of other devices this is a
different way of taking a look at your
settings and they're all categorized
pretty easily so if you wanted to look
at something like say your display all
of the circles come up and it's pretty
easy to know exactly what you're getting
at but once we get to motion right here
you see that there are motions and
gestures and air view now air view is
one that I think a lot of you probably
really did enjoy from the Samsung Galaxy
s4 where you can hover your finger over
a gallery album or over various portions
of the OS and you would get a preview of
what's underneath but for a little while
there I wasn't sure where the air
gestures were and they are under the
motions and gestures now they've
consolidated everything into various
sections right here and when you turn on
the when you go to turn on rather those
features it'll show you exactly what
you're looking at so if I turn on the
air browse which is essentially the air
gestures from the galaxy s4 you'll be
able to see exactly which parts of the
phone you'll be able to use your hand in
order to scroll up or down using your
hand and the one that if the one that
came in the samsung galaxy s4 was a
smart pause in which you could look away
from the phone wall playing let's say a
YouTube video and you'd be able to end
the phone would pause the video until
you look back at it one very stark
change when it comes to the general
outlook of the Samsung Galaxy s5 is the
doing away of a menu button and using
instead a recent apps button which is
right over here on the left you
obviously already have the back button
and there on the right but when she hit
this button on the left side you will
see that there is a slightly modified
recent apps screen and it's just pretty
simple for all intents and purposes you
just swipe away in order to turn off
some there's a button right here for
turning off all of them and then there's
actually a task manager or apps manager
rather shortcut that you can go to which
is familiar from previous models also as
we head on over to the fingerprint
scanner under the personalization area
of the settings if you do the
fingerprint scanner is going to ask me
to register my fingerprints by swiping a
bunch of time
from the top of the home key and down so
I'm just going to keep doing that so
once you have it set up simply wake up
the phone I didn't want to provide it'd
prefer to have it so that I could just
swipe my finger across the fingerprint
scanner here and then it would wake up
but you do have to wake the phone up and
then it will prompt to you to unlock it
which is perfectly fine I was just
hoping it would be in a different way
and then of course we have the heart
rate monitor on the back which is very
simple we are already in s health I'll
just go ahead and hit the heart rate
section and once it says start says
ready to place it place the finger on
the sensor we'll just do that right now
and you can see a red light turns on an
infrared light that goes that looks
under my skin essentially in order to
find out what my heart rate is and so
there you have it for the software
feature focus here on the Samsung Galaxy
s5 we saw that a number of new features
came in some of them based upon the
hardware like the heart rate monitor but
overall we have a TouchWiz that is very
familiar to us but still brings back a
lot of features that you may or may not
have liked already from the previous
Samsung Galaxy s4 stay tuned for more
coverage of the Samsung Galaxy s5 here
at MWC in Barcelona Spain once again
