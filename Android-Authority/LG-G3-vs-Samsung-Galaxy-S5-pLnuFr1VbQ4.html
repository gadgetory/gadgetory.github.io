head-to-head hey it's Josh from Garf a
mandroid authority and this is the LG g3
versus the Samsung Galaxy s5 when it
comes to design both of these phones
tried to go somewhere different with
their overall material choices in both
cases they didn't stray too far from the
status quo but either one managed to
bring something different to the table
whereas the galaxy s5 mostly retains the
rounded look in the corners and
maintains a pretty signature Samsung
look all around its backing is now made
of a perforated or dimpled plastic
material it might not have been the most
welcomed change for anyone that was one
sick of glossy plastic but then open to
the faux leather back of the Galaxy Note
line LG seems to have a grasp on the
negativity towards of glossy plastic by
now and thus has moved to harder
polycarbonate treated to have a brushed
feel we all hoped it might be metal this
time around but this change was still
quite welcome the g3 thus has an
attractive exterior that arguably moved
in a more positive direction when
compared to the galaxy s5 the galaxy s5
retains the same button layout we all
come to expect with the tactile home
button flanked by back and this time a
recent apps button the power button and
volume rockers are found on the sides we
might just be getting used to the
unorthodox button layout of the g3 which
brings with it the back button layouts
introduced in its predecessor index
finger usage might take a little while
to get used to but actually it gets
pretty natural over time when it comes
to handling you would think that we
would have to take the LG g3 s larger
screen into much more consideration but
that isn't necessarily the case while
the screen on the Galaxy S 5 did get
bumped up by a fraction of the of an
inch the LG g3 grew by almost half an
inch what is so striking about LG's
phone is that despite its up sizing the
overall phone doesn't really dwarf the
s5 by more than maybe a couple
millimeters on each side the result is a
great handling experience on the g3 that
is only somewhat tougher to fathom than
the s5 if you are a stickler for
one-handed usage then the Galaxy s5 will
probably be better for you but
admittedly not by much the reason for
this compact design and LG's flagship is
due to the very thin bezels all around
maximizing the screen real estate the s5
on the other hand grew its bezels out a
little more likely as an accommodation
to the IP certification
and speaking of which the s5 might be
able to take a tumble and a splash more
often than the g3 obviously because of
the g3 not having that certification
however we do have to tip the hat to LG
for bringing a larger screen without
really making the learning curve that
much steeper display technology might be
hotly debated here as the IPS performer
on the g3 has been blown up quite a bit
while the AMOLED tech spec today to
higher saturation is the name of the
game when it comes to the s5 with colors
that really punch out sharpness is great
on the screen packing the 1080p
resolution and 432 pixels per inch and
the viewing angles are pretty great all
around when compared to the larger LG g3
screen we don't see the s5 display
really losing too much ground actually
but the g3 screen is still definitely a
sight to behold
a pretty massive increase to 2560 by
1440 resolution and 534 pixels per inch
is noticeable when compared to the 1080p
performer not by to much but enough to
at least note text viewing then is a
breeze on here and media viewing does
get a boost with that larger screen
making games and video enjoyable across
the board while its viewing angles might
sell for a bit and its colors take on a
warmer tone the main takeaway here is
that with that larger screen enjoyment
is still completely possible and greatly
enhanced by that larger display that LG
managed to shove into its newest device
if you need punch your colors and you
don't need the higher resolution while
the Samsung Galaxy s5 screen will be
great for you still we just give LG
quite a bit of credit for doing a pretty
damn good job on their first 2k screen
performance is where little ground is
gained on either side as both sports the
Snapdragon 801 clocked in at 2.5
gigahertz backed by the Adreno 330 the
g3 is 32 gigabyte variant here gets a
boost to 3 gigabytes of RAM over the s5s
general to work and player ultimately as
easy as they can get on these 2
flagships as either one will perform
exactly the way you need them to users
are tend to harp on lag won't find any
that will truly hinder their experience
but it is worth noting that both
operating systems can suffer from some
architectural issues that can be
perceived as lag it's not the power or
lack thereof in the processing packages
but the way that the user interfaces
load or are structured the recent apps
screen is an example in the LG while the
my magazine loading every article
once is an example for the s5 Altima T
speed is really in no shortage here and
you'll get everything you need to do
done there's also no shortage and
hardware offerings though samsung
continues to try and pack in more than
the competition with usefulness always
proving to be the final question in
either case or removable backing allows
you access to the replaceable battery
and micro SD card slots and all of the
ranges of connectivity are available in
either of these devices including NFC
and IR blasters not to mention the fact
that both of these devices will be on
all major carriers especially in the
states where the Samsung Galaxy s5
somewhat pulls ahead is in its heart
rate monitor on the back and the
fingerprint scanner embedded into the
home button these are features
extensively looked over and were
ultimately found to be only useful for
anyone specifically looking for them
which is actually kind of rare we would
much prefer to say that the s5
definitely pulls ahead of the g3 with
its IP certification making it a much
sturdier phone but really when you're
looking for just all of the generally
needed tools everything from controlling
TVs to having bluetooth headsets as
possible on both of these devices and in
battery life the ability to work long
hours is basically felt across the board
which is a plus for the g3 because it
manages to go the distance
even with its larger screen it's in the
cameras that we find some real
differences as both LG and samsung bring
their own flavors of enhancements to the
table the Samsung Galaxy s5 includes its
ISO cell technology which takes a
somewhat different approach to capturing
photo data it does yield some great
photos and continues the tradition of
Samsung's great optics quality colors
are really out there as is usually the
case with Samsung and its signature
saturation details are all captured
pretty well in good lighting and they
expectedly taper off as you take it away
so 16 megapixels also gives you quite a
bit of room to crop and cater your photo
if you need to LG on the other hand has
continued to improve on their optical
image stabilization with OIS plus making
the case that it's a feature most phones
should start to come with but that's not
all they have done this time around as a
laser focusing system helps track
subjects even faster and ultimately
yields of focusing speed leaps and
bounds better than found in the original
g2 it's clear that they believe in the
laser as the camera interface starts off
pretty bare providing only press to
focus and shoot capable
when it comes to quality I do find the
playing field more or less even between
these two the high saturation of the
galaxy has five shots keep pretty much
every photo from being dull and is at a
level somewhat higher than that of the
g3 Samsung's camera also provides a
little more functionality as well as
manual controls for you to really cater
your shot but the LG g3 manages to
create consistently great photos even in
its auto mode which is a testament to
its capabilities pictures tend to take a
warmer tone overall but detail is still
captured well and the aesthetic remains
pleasing throughout low-light
performance doesn't happen to favor
either of these cameras despite Samsung
software enhancements and LG's go is in
the end the Samsung provides a little
more freedom for anyone who wants better
control but the LG g3 camera is the
faster performer with its laser guided
system and it still manages to keep the
quality level pretty high and finally in
software we see enhancements in either
updated operating system all of which
hope to refresh what had up to that
point gotten overplayed and pretty dull
in a nutshell the core Android
experience is at its best no matter
which phone you choose so it's about
what they could possibly add to the
formula as Samsung has consistently put
new features into its interface LG has
also made its own strides in providing
users useful tools we start with Samsung
whose use of a circle motif has
permeated throughout the settings areas
while a flatter look all around did
clean things up a bit
various familiar Samsung features
returning the s5 like multi window and
navigation abilities like air gestures
additions include a tool box for easy
access to five defined apps and a
download booster that uses data and
Wi-Fi in tandem and it actually works
pretty damn well my magazine tried to
bring a highly useful second homescreen
news service but its ties to Flipboard
made it little more than a full-screen
widget putting too many layers between
you and your content what strikes us
most about the updates to the TouchWiz
UI was that despite all it tried to do
to be different it felt more like a skin
over the same old UI that is either
loved or hated by now while the changes
are welcome they actually did do too
much to really change anything so how
did LG fare with its own changes well
for the most part we liked where the
aesthetic has gone though we did find it
more about hiding elements rather
then fundamentally changing them
multi-window does finally make it to the
g3 which makes perfect sense considering
the larger screen new editions are
basically the smart applications like a
smart cleaner for deleting temporary
files and the smart notify that amounted
to little more than a wordy weather
report
wondering where qslide in queue memo
went they're still there just hidden
behind yet another shade in the
notification drop-down the most useful
software future continues to be the
knock-on or the NOC code an easy way of
adding security to the phone without
making it too hard to access as a result
in the end you get an absolute slew of
features available across the board with
so many tools at your disposal the
question is will you use them for
example I pretty much never use the air
gestures in the Samsung Galaxy s5 and
then in the LG g3 I still never use
qslide apps so despite the enhancements
made to the software Suites we do have
to wag the finger to both of these
phones because they try to offer so much
in their operating systems that
ultimately proved to be less than useful
now both phones will come in at the
premium prices for contracts on major
carriers though the s5 has been
available for some time now and is
currently easier to get your hands on
unlocked both phones will come close to
the typical $700 price point for
flagships and so there you have it the
LG g3 and the Samsung Galaxy s5 it's
easy to get excited about the larger
screen of the LG g3 but when we look
underneath that surface we find an
experience that is at its best that it
has ever been and bursting at the seams
with capabilities but the same can be
said for the phone in the opposite
corner - the massive screen over the
years LG has gained ground on Samsung
proving it can offer just as much if not
possibly more than Samsung in their
flagship devices we continue to get
close to an even playing field here with
separations including LG's 2k screen
only falling short of having the IP
certification found in the galaxy s5 in
software the feature lists are arguably
too long in either case though the core
experience is as good as ever both
cameras are great at what they do though
the leap forward in the g3 is better
filter than the ISO cell tech of the s5
and finally the same can be said for the
material choice as the g3 manages to
look and feel better in our opinion then
the somewhat step back over the Galaxy
s5s dimpled cover while Samsung has
always been pretty good
LG is truly coming into its own and it
shows in the g3 and in the end you can't
go wrong with either of these devices as
always thank you guys very much for
watching and hope you enjoyed this
comparison between the LG g3 and the
Samsung Galaxy s5 in the end both of
these phones are absolutely wonderful
and they do great things but we do have
to just wag the finger a little bit at
the Samsung Galaxy s5 primarily because
it tries to offer too much and it kind
of bogs down the overall experience on
the g3 you could say the same about the
2k screen but in the end it is still an
enjoyable experience mostly because of
its larger size so keep it tuned to
Android authority for all of the best
coverage including future comparisons of
the LG g3 and all of the flagships
including the HTC One m8 and the Sony
Xperia z2 coming very soon keep it tuned
