brought to you by domain.com so you know
how most of you were busting at the
seams at the thought that Google might
be creating their own wireless carrier
yeah think about it the nexus of
carriers sounds sweet but according to
The Wall Street Journal that Google
carrier will only apply to Nexus sixes
according to people familiar with the
matter Google's wireless service may end
up launching by the end of March which
would be much sooner than we expected
additionally the report states that the
new wireless service would only be
compatible with the Nexus 6 and no other
Android devices the report states and I
quote the service designed to switch
among Wi-Fi and cellular networks will
initially be available only on the
latest Nexus 6 smartphone designed by
google and made by motorola mobility a
former google unit now owned by china's
lenovo group set to people familiar with
the matter one of those people said the
service won't work with older Nexus
devices such as the Nexus 5 but you
lucky Nexus 6 owners don't get your
hopes up too soon the sources claim that
while there's potential for the service
to launch in the coming weeks the start
might be delayed also the service will
reportedly combine both t-mobile and
Sprint networks with available Wi-Fi
networks in the hopes to obtain the best
signal from any location but don't fret
too much because if this proves
successful google has a good reason to
expand this capacity to other phones but
you don't need a nexus 6 to take
advantage of Google's new car insurance
comparison tool google has just
introduced a new tool to help you save
money the next time you want to buy car
insurance it's called google compare for
car insurance and will display both
national and local insurance providers
in order to get you the best deal there
are only 14 partners on board with the
comparison tool thus far but the company
hopes to add more in the near future in
explaining the new tool to car insurance
providers Google States you can
highlight what makes your business
unique whether that's an A rating and
customer service or better discounts for
safe drivers and when your users adjust
their deductible or add additional cars
to their quote you can
show updated pricing that matches their
needs they can buy their policy online
or over the phone through one of your
agents now for the time being this
service is only rolling out to
Californians but we'll hope to expand
other states very soon now for those of
you who are fans of Sony design
smartphones like I am will be
disheartened to know that Sony may be
pulling out of the smartphone market all
together no matter what part of the
world you live in Sony is likely a
household name for the past several
decades the Japanese mega corporation
has dabbled in a variety of talking
points ranging from consumer electronics
to healthcare and biotech recently
however the company has fallen on some
hard times in the past few years its
leadership has made some radical changes
in 2014 Sony made an exit from the pc
business selling off its well-known PC
brand to a japanese investment firm
after pulling the plug on its PC efforts
Sony stated that it would shift its
focus towards smartphones and tablets
here we are a little over 12 months
later and the company CEO is making an
even more drastic move recently
announcing that the company will no
longer pursue profits in smartphone
sales a far cry from Sony's declaration
last februari last februari Sony CEO
said that he would not rule out the
possibility of exiting the smartphone
market altogether but it gets worse for
Sony fans because if you have a sony
device that's not an xperia z series
device you are not getting lollipop at
all but it's not all bad news for Sony
they're still making great sleek sexy
devices in this case in the form of a
tablet and the Zed for tablet is getting
a lot of attention I talked about it
last week and that thing is so thin and
light it floats almost the
newly-announced experience that for
tablet may not look hugely different
from its predecessor but sony has spent
considerable effort trimming down all
the excess space and fat from this new
tablet making the zed for tablet one of
the most lightweight on the market how
lightweight you ask well light enough to
be carried off by a few helium-filled
balloons it seems as sony has shown off
in its latest promotional video filmed
in beautiful barthelona not only can the
Zed for tablet swim but the bugger can
fly too
well more like float know if that's not
scientific enough for you the Zed for
tablet is 6.1 millimeters thin compared
to the six point four millimeters from
the previous generation and weighs just
389 grams this makes it a full 50 grams
lighter than the z2 tablet and
considerably lighter than Samsung's
similarly sized 10.5 inch Galaxy Tab s
