back in June and I had some pretty mixed
thoughts about the design first of all
it looks exactly like an iPhone and I
know that a lot of Android manufacturers
have been accused of making iPhone
clones over the years but this phone in
particular looks pretty much exactly
like an iPhone 10 down to the camera
module placement but I don't really
wanted to get my hands on one of these
phones because in theory the me a offers
a ton of value to the consumer it's not
all the same flagship specs that pretty
much every flagship in 2018 has so far
but it comes in at just under $400 which
is like half the price of every other
flagship right now but before we talk
about that nitty-gritty stuff I really
just want to talk about the design and
like I said before it looks like an
iPhone and I kind of now understand why
it looks like an iPhone chummy's primary
market is China if you go and try to buy
an iPhone 10 in China it's gonna run you
like $1200 in contrast if you go out and
try to buy an e 8 it's gonna cost you
like 390 or just a little bit less than
400 dollars that means you could buy it
like 3 me apes for the price of one
iPhone 10 Xiaomi is definitely trying to
undercut Apple here I mean their
hardware is still really good like in my
opinion it's almost just as good as the
iPhone 10 and when you can offer
flagship specs that are pretty much the
same as every other Android manufacturer
that's a lot of value for the money and
that being said the hardware is just
kind of boring I mean it just kind of
looks like a black iPhone and there's
not any gimmicky features that are gonna
make you run out and immediately buy
this thing it does have an IR based face
unlock feature which is only really seen
in like the iPhone 10 and the Oppo find
X so that's pretty nice but I don't
think that it's a deal-breaker for
people that are looking for specific
features in a phone even though the
hardware is pretty boring the camera is
actually pretty good it has a lot of
dynamic range and really good sharpness
there's actually this Auto enhanced
feature in the guy
which just kind of brings up the shadows
and makes everything look a little bit
better if you actually turn it on the
new i-10 update in this phone actually
enabled front-facing portrait mode and
it's actually really good
I mean it's not gonna rival like - pixel
- or anything like that but it's a lot
better than a lot of other flagships
that are twice the price of this thing
so that's kind of all there is to say
about the hardware and I know that
wasn't really a lot but I really think
that the software is where this phone
really shines as a little bit of
background me you I actually existed
before any Xiaomi phones actually were
made so they originally reformed as a
competitor to CyanogenMod if you
remember that asked eeks and nerds used
to flash our phones like every other day
just to try different like roms of
Android and me you I was like a major
competitors to CyanogenMod after a while
the company pretty much decided they
should just make a phone and their
business strategy has been really good
so far they're still undercutting a lot
of other people in the market and
they're making really great Hardware you
can if it's a little bit boring MEU eye
is really where this phone shines I mean
it's pretty simple it's very similar to
stock Android and they're using a lot of
Google Apps and replacement of like
actually making their own apps for
things they've also got a meet community
app which is built right into the phone
where you can go and leave feedback and
vote on changes and then you might even
see one of these changes in your phone
within two weeks that's pretty crazy and
I've only really seen companies like
essential pay that much attention to
their customers and I mentioned this
earlier but the phone was just updated
to me UI 10.0 and it's not a huge update
it's not like they actually moved to
Android 9pi they still haven't done that
yet but they did make it look like PI
which is kind of the interesting thing
they've added all those bubbly UI
elements that are in material design 2.0
and even like the volume sliders and
everything have changed to this kind of
bubbly googly design but unfortunately
everything's not perfect in the UI
there's been a bit of controversy that's
popped up lately where users have been
seeing ads in their UI and that's kind
of a problem and I actually talked to
Xiaomi about this and they told me that
they use ads like this to subsidize the
price of their phones and just make them
a little bit
but in my opinion if they're not upfront
with people about the fact that they're
doing this this is kind of a huge
problem if you wouldn't bought like a
Kindle from Amazon and you got the
version with ads it's very obvious that
you're getting ads on your tablet but if
you just go and buy a meat ate it
doesn't say this phone comes with ads on
the box so you kind of just need to be
aware of that now personally I haven't
actually seen any ads on my meat so I
don't really know if it's gonna happen
in every phone or if it's just a few use
cases but it's still really annoying
that they would put that there if you
can ignore those problems then overall
this phone is still a really good phone
I mean like I said the hardware is like
a little bit boring but it's really just
made to compliment me UI it's not like
the me mix - or me mix to s which has
really interesting hardware it's more of
just simplistic and kind of boring
hardware to complement the UI and all
that leads us to what I like to call the
poco problem so if you've been on
YouTube in the last like month 32 you've
probably heard of this phone called the
poco f1 now this is by a brand called
polka phone which is actually a
subsidiary of Xiaomi which is a little
bit strange they spun off from Xiaomi
but they offer another flagship phone
with pretty much the exact same specs as
the me eight for $300 which is $100 less
not only that but this phone has a
headphone jack uses a Kevlar back
instead of a glass back which a lot of
people might find better or worse it's
up to you and it's got a massive four
thousand milliamp hour battery which is
a lot better than the me eight cause me
eight gets pretty average battery life
but it's really nothing special now the
issue here is like yeah the poco f1 is a
sub brand but it's better than the me
eight in almost every single way and
it's $100 less so when I was talking to
Xiaomi I asked him about this and I said
why does the Polka f1 exist if you're
trying to still sell me eight they told
me that they think that there is room
for both phones in the market but I just
don't really see that happening why
would you not go out and buy a poco f1
which has a headphone jack again has a
headphone jack and a four thousand
milliamp hour battery now they were like
oh you know on the meet
you get the glass design and you get the
AMOLED screen but in my opinion I don't
think that those are things that are
gonna make you want to buy the me eight
over the poco f1o so reviews are a
little bit weird right because I still
really like the Xiaomi me eight it's so
a really good phone but the poco last
one is just kind of a better phone and
it's cheaper and it's made by the same
company I'm not trying to like skew your
thoughts if you're thinking of getting a
me eight it's still a great phone but I
really recommend you look at the poco f1
first you'd have to remember that
nothing really exists in a bubble and
when something like this exists
especially when it's effectively made by
the same company you should probably be
looking at that instead anyways I hope
you guys enjoyed this review I know it's
like a little bit boring but that's
because the hardware is kind of boring
it just kind of looks like an iPhone but
the software is really where it's at so
if you haven't tried me UI I definitely
recommend it you have any questions make
sure you leave them in the comment
section and do your thing you guys know
how this works because of course we are
