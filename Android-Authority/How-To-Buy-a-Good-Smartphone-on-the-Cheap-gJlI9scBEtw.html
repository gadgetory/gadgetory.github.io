Jason this is where we try and answer
your most pressing Android questions and
today is not just about why smart phones
are so expensive but what you can do to
get the best bang for your buck now if
you think your smart phone is expensive
check out this puppy it's called the
savelii Jordan secret and it's no secret
because it starts at nine thousand
dollars starts at nine thousand dollars
with that you get iguana leather 18
karat gold
it's ceramic and of course diamonds for
that amount of money it should grow my
hair back so I look like a brownie but
when it comes to smartphone pricing
there's really one paramount question
and it's this with smartphones that are
upwards from six to eight hundred
dollars or more why is it that we have
tablets that use more resources larger
screens and our far less mainstream but
are yet less expensive than smaller
smartphones listen to what one Asus
executive said to that very question
with small devices asus is regional
director Jonathan San table said often
there's more engineering development and
testing required to shrink down the
components without affecting the heating
for example and still offering the best
performance I think the development and
tooling costs are also slightly higher
hmm question is do you buy it no I don't
this may have been somewhat true in the
earlier stages of smartphone development
by by today's standards so many people
are buying smart phones it's like the
number one electronic purchase around
the world you're buying people are
buying more smart phones more frequently
than they do laptops televisions cameras
anything economies of scale have to play
a significant role in reducing the
manufacturing costs of these smartphone
devices so why are they so high
simple supply and demand and for those
of you who haven't studied business yet
this is the definition of supply and
demand supply is the amount of something
that is available demand is how much of
that thing people want to buy
smartphones are hard to make and
manufacture it takes a lot of time
research and engineering skill to
produce it it's not like Fez dispensers
that we can make for cheap and sell at
the dollar store on the other hand we
have a ravenous insatiable appetite for
smartphones and we will therefore pay
almost anything that the manufacturer
asks us to pay simple supply and demand
that's why smart phones cost the way
they do but there are ways to minimize
that cost and it works like this here's
an example take a 32 gigabyte galaxy s5
which is water-resistant and features a
heart rate monitor and fingerprint
scanner it costs two hundred and fifty
six dollars and fifty two cents to build
according to a teardown done by IHS and
it's selling for around six hundred
fifty off contract in the US that's a
three hundred ninety three dollar profit
or a forty percent markup now to be fair
we're not factoring in research and
development supply chain management and
of course marketing but still that's a
lot of cheddar now I know it's some of
you are thinking you're thinking Jase I
can go to my local AT&amp;amp;T retail shop or
my own carrier and buy the Samsung
Galaxy s5 a great phone for 200 bucks
$1.99 on contract I got a great phone
affordable price I'm ready to rock and
roll mmm
no my friends you were caught in the
matrix wake up you are getting milked
you're getting bled dry exactly how much
will differ depending on the phone and
your carrier and your plan so you need
to do the math yourself but this is how
it worked for me now I won't bore you
with the math for me but it turns out
that over a two-year period alone I've
saved over $600 getting the nexus 5 off
contract than I would buying a new
flagship phone from a carrier like I did
with the original Galaxy Note
yeah they bled me really really good and
that was a three year contract so that
was close to $900 that I was bled not
good so rule number one buy off contract
buy a Nexus device if you can afford it
three hundred fifty bucks or four
hundred bucks if you want the 32
gigabyte model like I did and if that's
too much for you can't save up for a few
months for that consider the Moto e at
130 bucks it's hard to go wrong
I bought the Moto G for my teenagers and
it's almost as powerful in the Nexus 5
the Moto e has gotten great reviews it's
not a super powerful phone but it's a
very very decent phone for the price and
if you're in India or any of the other
Android 1 countries you have a many more
options for a hundred to $130 smart
phone check those out don't give in the
carrier evilness and buy into a contract
you're going to be bled and blood bad
and the final way to save a lot of money
on a decent Android phone is to buy off
eBay from a reputable seller a seller
who cares about the reputation and can
sell you a use phone that is still of
good quality it's a great way to get a
cheap used phone off contract alright
thanks for watching edward army
my name is Jase love to connect with you
right here on Google+ or Twitter I would
still love some more suggestions on what
more topics I should cover for Android q
and A's I'm running out of inspiration I
need some help so put them in the
comments below I will read them I can't
respond to them although don't forget
about my brothers and Android jaws Joe
and the tech ninja Kevin Laurel and
Chris I'm working really hard for the
best content on the web see you next
week on Android QA</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
