and Taipei and Qualcomm is finally
showing off the first 5g notebooks so
this is a reference design this is not
actually going to be an actual notebook
but Lenovo is announcing a new 5g
notebook called project limitless it's a
really exciting part about these 5g
notebooks is the power and battery life
that Qualcomm is able to get out of
these chips now they are on a seven
nanometer process which is opposed to a
10 millimeter process that Intel is
currently on and they're also seven
watts of TDP versus 15 watts so that
kind of shows the difference in how much
power these laptops are actually taking
up and Nicole come actually showed me a
bunch of benchmarks today they got 3d
mark and PC mark to make custom arm 64
versions of their benchmarking tests and
the graphics performance is actually
better than the Intel 8250
which is a 15 watt processor that's
running on a 10 nanometer process the
battery life was about twice as good as
the Intel 8252
higher now the general CPU performance
is about the same but the fact that
you're able to get this much performance
in a chip that barely uses any power and
can connect to 5g networks sub 6
gigahertz networks 4G networks and
everything below that is pretty amazing
now lenovo's 5g laptop is not launching
this year is probably gonna launch
sometime in 2020 they haven't quite
announced a date or a price but 5g
networks haven't really populated the
world yet we're not really sure if we're
gonna be partnering with Verizon anyway
last year they partnered with a
different telecommunications carrier to
show off their 4G pcs but these 5g pcs
are going to be extremely exciting
because you're gonna be able to pull so
much information so fast as long as you
live in a city that has 5g but then
there's also sub 6 gigahertz which means
you're just gonna be able to get crazy
good speeds anywhere you are
Lenovo's device is only running a 45
watt hour battery as opposed to
something like an 85 or a 90 watt hour
battery that are in a lot of Intel
computers and it just lasts about twice
as long which is pretty amazing it uses
like half the battery capacity but it
can last a lot longer than these other
devices now something that's pretty
interesting to note here is the fact
that no other manufacturers really
have five cheat ships ready for the
mass-market Intel of the 5g game they're
not making these modems anymore and why
I can't really produce these modems at
least in the US anymore so that kind of
begs the question who is going to be
making these modems except for Qualcomm
so if you're gonna see these 5g pcs
you're gonna probably have to bet that
it's going to be a Qualcomm chip inside
so sure we're gonna see a lot more 5g
PCs coming out in the future but we did
do some benchmarking make sure you head
over to Android Authority comm we've got
all those scores for you to check out
and stay tuned to our YouTube channel as
well because we've got a lot more coming
here from Computex 2019 so I will see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
