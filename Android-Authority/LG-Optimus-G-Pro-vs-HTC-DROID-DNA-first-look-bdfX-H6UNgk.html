andrew Authority what's going on
everybody and we got another verses for
you here we're looking at the LG optimus
g pro right here which is the new
powerhouse monster phone by LG coming in
at a 5.5 inch screen it really is trying
to blow away the market of the 5 inch
drones that we're likely going to see
this year in 2013 however speaking of
the 5 inch phones we have the droid DNA
right here the HTC droid DNA on verizon
and it is one of the first 5 inch to
screen 5 inch display phones out there
right now is one of the first to come
out and it is quite a popular film but
we're expecting the optimus g pro to be
just as if not more popular as i said
before it has a 5.5 inch screen at 1080p
both have 1080p displays as you can see
here at the brightness a little bit
lower on the on the DNA plus DNA rather
but you can see that the screen is still
very crisp at 441 PPI while the 5.5 inch
behemoth comes in at four hundred PPI as
far as build quality goes you're going
to see that the optimus g pro does have
a little bit of more of a plasticky look
it has it does have a quite a nice grip
but it is all plastic there so it does
have a little bit of a slippery touch to
it but still feels nice in the hand
which is different compared to the droid
DNA which has more of a rubberized back
a little bit but does feel a little bit
a little bit safer in the hand and in
that respect but to each their own after
all this is a much bigger display much
bigger phone form factor as a result so
you have a nice meaty feeling the phone
battery life is a very important factor
when it comes to these larger displays
and the droid DNA was rather mixed in
the results with its battery with a
twenty 20 milliamp hour battery inside
and not removable it did have a little
bit of problem a few problems however
the optimus g pro has a whopping 30
140mm element amp hour battery inside
that is removable and has expandable
memory which the droid DNA does not have
so those are a few options that you have
on this phone that make it a little bit
more of an attractive package after that
the camera is on the rear you have a 13
megapixel camera on the rear here on the
optimus g pro and 8 megapixel one on the
droid DNA while the front-facing cameras
while largely standard you have a 2.1
over here that can be used in dual
recording
so the optimus g pro has a lot of new
features a lot of things to bring to the
table and we're looking forward to
seeing how it's going to fare with the
rest of the 5-inch phones even though it
has a bit of a half-inch advantage on
all of them so like I said Josh regard
android authority we're here at mobile
world congress in barcelona spain and
we're going to be bringing you all the
best coverage because we are your source
