brought to you by Linda calm welcome
back to Android weekly my name is Jason
after this last week's news I have to
concede that the Nexus line is dead yes
and i don't mean dead isn't relevant i
mean google is going to now you may take
comfort in the fact that although the
information dot-com claims that the
nexus line will be axed there may be a
silver lining rumored to be called
android silver this is a plan to end the
nexus program in favor of a rebranded
google play experience program so how
exactly is this different from the
current nexus program and the google
play edition devices good question like
the google play edition program there
can be more than one android silver
device at a time where the program's
differ is that android silver handsets
won't necessarily be a hundred percent
stock android though they will need to
have minimal amounts of customization
and the bloatware present will need to
be user uninstalled bull without needing
root access it is believed that google
will give manufacturers financial
incentives to build android silver
devices thereby allowing google to rein
in the mobile operating system and allow
more android users to have the same
android experience like getting updates
on time that's the best news i've read
it alone oh I'm so if this is true it
sounds as if we'll be getting a near
Nexus experience at our local carrier
retail store but doesn't mean we'll get
a nexus price moving on to rumors about
an Amazon phone now there have been a
number of rumors about Amazon creating
their own smartphone but most of them
have been without any substance and tell
now the wall street journal reported
that amazon was actually getting closer
to finally releasing their near phantom
of a device in the report the Wall
Street Journal claimed that the handset
would in fact feature a no glasses 3d
technology something that has been
rumored since spring of 2013 we don't
have fully detailed SPECT information
just yet but the handset is rumored to
offer a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor to
by Ram a 4.7 inch 720 display you can
also expect a fire OS to run this device
now please friends keep in mind here
that we are about to enter the rumors
own but the phone is rumored to offer
six count'em six cameras including a
main rear camera with a 13 megapixel
resolution and a front facing camera for
taking selfies and video chatting the
other four front-facing cameras will be
used with other sensors to track the
position of the users face and eyes
allowing it to provide a unique 3d
experience now we can leave room Ervil
for the moment and talk about the LG g3
because LG just sent invitations out for
a major media event on May 27th now
while the invitation itself does not
explicitly mention the g3 the scale of
the event leaves no doubt that we are
indeed going to see the LG's new hero
device the LG g3 might be late to the
party but when it eventually lands it
will do it in style rumors mention a
quad HD display and a gold color option
leaked product shots tell us that the g3
will support LG's signature rear-mounted
power and volume buttons and we expect
some very thin bezels do you know how

today claims that samsung will release a
version of the galaxy s5

processor and three gigs of RAM version
