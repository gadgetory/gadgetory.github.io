live here from Austin Texas we're with
android authority representing South by
Southwest we went and saw the VR loud
music experience panel and we're trying
to basically try and do new things here
vr is really a significant game changer
in terms of platforms we really are
committed to it and we're really
committed towards providing you guys the
best coverage so we thought it
worthwhile to bring some team members
again include Josh Berg era Jonathan
died nor have gondia and myself and we
came down here to Austin Texas and we
got to see this amazing panel and we saw
a lot of panels a lot of it to do with
VR but this was by far the most kind of
mind-blowing you had industry veterans
who've worked with VR and all this live
broadcasting media for basically two
decades and they talked about all the
sort of challenges they faced whether
its bandwidth or codecs or how to stitch
or the audio or placement how to create
these stories don't mean to swing any on
this hypothesis our region innovative is
what I do with this is go for it but
keep store in mind and how I can tell
that story in mind
and think about breathing how you
approach yourselves in terms of how you
present yourselves a memorable story
drives consumption and so for example
they were doing things you know with
rolling stones and now all these other
major major bands and they're trying to
do create fear experiences and it's not
as simple is really just slapping a VR
camera in the middle of the concert they
wanted to have maybe 10 VR rigs 4k 60
frames a second and they have all
control from a broadcast center then
they will have all this independent
binaural spatial audio and it's just
amazing hear them talk about it because
we're really really committed to be our
because it's most immersive platform to
come well there's Google cardboard
oculus HTC V you name it you really do
tend to become so much that you forget
about everything you forget about
reality the challenges food experience
where fewer doesn't have to be fun maybe
they can just jump into it they
naturally move with it at all as a
natural movement so these are that's
where we come in
and try to deliver that in the best
possible way and the court granted to we
got chance to ask them some questions
you know because we're planning to do
some some verra live streaming for
example one of the sort of a basic
friends was applied to
the data 0 good because you matter how
efficient your codec is you yeah it's
all about central output really like
it's really like what does that
broadcaster have available for them and
they have a dedicated line who were
dedicated satellite community they
always forget the cost and it's a
costume and broadcasting and millions of
people are easily picked it up a couple
hundred thousand you're looking at you
know sometimes millions of dollars how
long it is and who has that kind of
connection let alone more importantly
who has that kind of bandwidth to upload
so I'm basically trying to figure out
everything and that's why we attended
this and yeah we have some really
exciting stuff to come in the future for
you guys I mean geez it was a trying to
recount the specifics is difficult but
there was just so many aha moments and
everything that came out of every single
one of these gentlemen's mouse was just
like a quote that you could almost look
back in time and you could realize that
we're on the threshold of a huge game
changer in terms of consumption content
all the reviews we do for you guys
weathers of the s7 or the Nexus 6p or
any of the great content we do it's
always in 2d you know you're going to
see this frame but imagine being able to
see everything around you up and down
all the perception I that affords and
frankly I don't think any of us are
prepared at how much of a title shift in
content production that we're looking at
happened in the last year
it's been growing 22 years kind of jaron
lanier who were started working on VR
back in the mid-90s so everything's vr
is the latest greatest thing is like
saying that there was no digital music
before the ipod know that we're
committed to the future and know that we
are going to provide you guys the very
best coverage and all the things we are
and all things android of course we're
still very kind of in our infancy with
regards to everything you know
technology of the future will be
invisible but for now we we want to take
advantage of all these incredible
mediums to show you guys and you know I
if we're up to me we would find a way to
give all you guys google cardboard
devices you know so that you could put
your smartphone and you can experience
this VR maybe we'll be able to work
something on the future but for now stay
tuned for us we're android authority is
up by southwest we're going to give you
guys some more cool VR stuff thanks a
lot for checking into our channel and
thank you for your support</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
