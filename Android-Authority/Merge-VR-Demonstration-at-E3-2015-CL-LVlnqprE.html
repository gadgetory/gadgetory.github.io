Authority what's going on everybody and
we're here at e3 super excited I'm here
with Andrew crush who are actually very
affectionately called crush II in our
team
I'm here with grouchy and you may know
him from the FDP we have lawn and Darcy
here as well and our first meeting of
the day today was with merge VR so
actually the guys over here were able to
get a demo of it actually got to try it
out so I'm gonna let grossie give us a
rundown on what merge VR is all about
all right so basically merge VR is a VR
headset obviously it is made of a high
quality foam they call their right yeah
and polyurethane yes and then it's
adjustable and unlike some of them the
top strap you actually can take off so
it's more comfortable for people with
like lawn has tell they're for people
with long hair they're not gonna have
problems with this way the cool thing
about this is that it's not just it is
cardboard compatible I wanna get that
other way it will be fully compatible
with cardboard but beyond that they'll
have its own ecosystem of apps that take
use of this remote and this remote it's
kind of like the kind of a Wii Remote so
to speak swing things around like if
you're playing a game that requires
action you just swing it through and you
know reload there's fire button to
trigger buttons and yeah it'll work with
any Android phone right now that you in
the preview we showed off iOS yeah
you're gonna see the guys that were that
we got the demo way that with merge VR
obviously it was made using an iOS
device so I got slid through there and
we were able to play some more they were
actually adding I didn't do it
they were able to play a there's like a
wizard reach I was like a you basically
I don't know what the game was called it
was just a demo but you had a wand and
you have these like pumpkins and like
bats and stuff and with the pumpkins to
shoot at them and then with a bat you're
sitting here you know yeah that's the
thing about the controller's that
actually is a one-to-one movement with
the actual with the actual game itself
so it is like a Wii Remote in that way
it just doesn't look like one which it
kind of does but it actually has the
movement in there and it actually is
able to latch on to the side this is the
part that I remember it's actually able
to latch them to the side and that
motion tracking will be able to allow
you to have even better AVR like
perspective I suppose to the term yeah
and so yeah and then of course it is
have it I can use your phone sensors to
track as you move things around so uh as
far as pricing everything I think they
said they're looking at about a hundred
and thirty dollars final retail and when
final retail does arrive it will have
Android even though we saw a demo with
iOS Android will be a priority and we'll
be ready to go and also wasn't there a
connection to the cardboard applications
with their that cardboard apps would be
compatible with it for the most part
actually yeah I said that basically
anything cardboard related will work on
this and then they'll be an ecosystem of
apps they're gonna have their own app
where you can like find curated created
information and then it will then link
over to the Play Store so you can
download from there and it's a as its
own UI for like selecting apps once you
once you load up the app you put it on
and then you could find it use the
headset to navigate so it's it's
definitely you know it's a cool way to
expand on what cardboards doing you know
I haven't had a lot of like compared to
Josh's had you know the vive and you
know I think VR is gonna be a huge focus
here at e3 most likely and there are
already a lot of people where you could
only be able to meet it could be said
right off that you know Android isn't
it's we're not at the same point as we
are with the rift I mean obviously but
it's a lot more accessible to price
things a lot lower it's it's something
that anyone can have and it's a lot more
mobile I mean you look at the equipment
evolve for the rift you have to hook up
the you have to hook up your rig you
have to hook up you know yeah this you
could take anywhere you can take your
phone and that's it's it's light it
weighs nothing you know it's and even
the material will help if you have it on
for long periods of time it'll help with
the whole sweat is why probably most and
the long hair problem that we said
earlier lies right over other side over
there well we do have merge VR we have a
lot more vor platforms so take a look at
and a lot more Android gaming platforms
to talk about so make sure you keep it
tuned here to andrew authority we're
coming to you live from e3 here in LA my
hometown</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
