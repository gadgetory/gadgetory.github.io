by bitdefender mobile security hey it's
josh regard from android authority
what's going on everybody and we're here
at day one of the Mobile World Congress
I am of course here with darksteel a
cuvette Evandro 30 all right and it's
art it's day one of the actual show
itself and you can see behind us that
all of the boots are more or less tarped
up because it's the end of the day today
was again we go and just say hell day
today was held a ok day yeah Davis d-day
because a lot of the big announcements
happened on this very day it was usually
we end up calling it like press today
but press just means hell for a lot of
reasons but anyway we didn't want to
recap not just two days of happenings
but also what happened yesterday
essentially a quick day 0 recap and the
main one that we want to talk about is
LG because they came out with a couple
of great announcements yesterday even
before the show actually started and I'm
gonna let Darcy sort of recap what will
happen with LG LG pro 2 which offers a
best-in-class display to screen size
ratio of 77.2 percent still 1080p but
they're focusing a lot on the knock on
feature set which consumers that really
appreciate studying the comments people
really like it I have Sam a big fan too
personally it is pretty fun yeah it is
pretty fun yeah the g pro 2 not just an
enlarged version of the g two but it
actually has a little bit of its own
design philosophy with that sort of mesh
store I kept calling it Matt but it's
more like a mesh back and also to they
really focused on their post image
processing with OAS plus you know which
we did a comparison on and I found it
you know from really looking at the
images really closely Josh showed one
hundred percent crop that it actually
does do a lot of improvement it does so
it's really nice to see that LG's
focusing a lot on you know the software
was really interesting to see just how
sharp the images were when you get to
that crop in the middle it was really
just wow I was a little bit amazed to be
honest about the optical image
stabilization it's still kind of a new
thing in the smartphone space but it
only has to go up from here so I'm
really excited to see where that goes so
um we come on to the first day of mwc
which was today and we started off with
the huge
on the one that all of you are probably
watching right now as we're filming this
recap you know everybody has something
to say about Samsung and the galaxy line
I think a lot of people are gonna be
really excited about the camera the
camera its brand new table okay I'm not
gonna say brand new technology buts
technology we haven't really seen in a
smartphone yet and it's this technology
that allows it to have not only higher
megapixel cam but also being able to
utilize every one of those mega pixels
at a very nice way they talk about more
sharpness less less grain and all of the
photos better low-light performance
we're obviously not going to know and so
we actually get to play with the camera
extensively but from what we saw there
really adding in a lot of really nice
features and really cool if any of you
guys will recall the lytro as the camera
that you're allowed to control the depth
of field after you take a shot
essentially what they're doing is
they're grabbing I think like probably
100 maybe 150 shots in real time and
they allow you after the fact to say i
want the depth of field to be in the
back or I wanted to be in the front so
you can have those really cool hipster
bouquet shop that Josh's things well
well I might be I might consider myself
somewhat of I stole I'm trying to be
humble I still consider myself an
amateur photographer but definitely
having some of that freedom in
smartphone photography is what would
make it kind of go over the top for
those of us who love our DSLRs it might
guess mirrorless cameras and whatnot as
you might see if you look at the
comments section in those videos already
some people may not be that happy with
the design choice but well you know what
it's a choice that they made and it's
something that I'll see unfortunately
are gonna have to live with unless of
course you change the back yourself for
the size of the screen I do find the
galaxy s phones to be the best handling
ones of their size and that's why I get
excited about the phones maybe galaxy
syndrome will come back a little bit
later but I got a galaxy fever again no
galaxy Syndrome is when all of the
things that you were excited about a few
months later you don't even use them
anymore that's galaxy syndrome that's I
coined that in a previous video um but
after that i'm gonna go ahead you were
really excited about yes there was the
gear to then the gear to was rumored and
it became true but unfortunately for the
gear to it was quickly overshadowed by
the gear fit and you know you're really
excited so let's go ahead and talk about
the gear well i mean
it's just what can i say i'm kind of
astounded by it you know it offers a
curved sort of well first of all it's
curved AMOLED technology from Samsung
yes um you know it's such a bright and
vibrant display and so response is that
it almost looks like it's painted on you
know it has a heart rate monitor built
into it it's going to communicate
unfortunately from the sounds of it only
with galaxy devices to start but I think
they might change their lot they're
probably gonna change their tune pretty
think so cuz if the gear fit sells like
crazy which it will which is hopefully
will especially with a good price point
then people are gonna be demanding it
and you know plenty of plenty of people
out there you developers out there gonna
find a way to get it on your Nexus lives
and what it'll definitely but until then
hopefully high sales equal putting it on
and we fought you know for a low price
point because oh yeah we really think
that technology like that you know as
you'll see the video here it should be
sub 150 even like a closer to someone
because that's what the other fitness
trackers are price exactly yeah Sony is
kind of really taking a i'm not sure
what the best word for this is but
they're taking a more sort of condensed
of release schedule yeah they don't
really wait too long to bring out the
next release of their smartphones or
their tablets and in this case that was
true now we have the xperia z2 and the
Xperia tablet Z 2 so what did we think
about the ultamate I mean for all you
guys that you know we're hitting on the
bezels of the original z1 in g1 s you're
gonna be very pleased to know that
they've slimmed down the bezels on the
z2 yes it looks stunning the design
language has been more refined and also
too I mean the tablet Z 2 it's so light
it is yeah I was astounded when I first
picked up that tablet and I thought dang
there's my wrist they soften the edges
to you know
on it because it looks so rigid on the
last one yeah yeah if you killed it if
you held the corners in your palms it
would get it wouldn't hurt but you could
feel it Deb Valley and also IPS displays
so we're going to be looking at
best-in-class viewing angles in plane
switching technology another gripe so
they dealt with a whole bunch of
problems that were with the original Z 1
and Z so really good to see that their
continue to iterate you know absolutely
yeah okay what about to run out of
battery all right so if</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
