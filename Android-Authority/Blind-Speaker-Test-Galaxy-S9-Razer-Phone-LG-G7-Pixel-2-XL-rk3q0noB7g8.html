Authority and today we're gonna do
something a little bit different a
little bit more fun we're gonna do a
blind audio phone speaker test and we're
gonna use four phones that have a pretty
big emphasis on phone speaker audio and
I'm gonna tell you which for phones
we're gonna be using you're probably
seeing it in the thumbnail or maybe in
the YouTube title anyways but I'm not
gonna tell you which order these four
phones are in that's gonna be up to you
to guess but the four phones that are on
this table right now are the razor phone
the pixel two XL the LG G seventh in
queue and the Samsung Galaxy S nine plus
so the way this is gonna work is I'm
gonna play the same exact audio track on
all four of these phones one at a time
I'm gonna play about 15 seconds on each
phone and we're just gonna move on down
the line as quickly as we possibly can
I'm gonna start with phone one and then
just work my way down to phone four and
it's gonna be up to you guys to guess
which phone is which and on top of doing
that we also want you to tell us which
phone you think sounds the best and
that's sort of where the numbers come
into play because you don't know exactly
which phone is behind which number you
can just tell us which number you think
sounded the best so you can say phone
for some of the best or phone one some
of the best etc so make sure to leave
that in the comment section as well that
is the most important part and we're
gonna take those results the results
that you guys give us in the comments
and we're gonna come back with a video
later on revealing the answer as to
which phone was which and also compare
it to our more scientific audio testing
that we're gonna do and see how
different or how similar the results may
be to what you guys might have heard now
obviously this particular test here that
we're doing is not very scientific
because the audio is going to be
recorded through my zoom h5 n here and
then it's gonna be edited in Final Cut
Pro and then upload it to YouTube which
is going to compress the audio even more
so what I hear here in this room is not
going to be exactly identical to what
you might
hearing through your headphones but it's
still in an interesting experiment
nonetheless
so let's go ahead just get right into it
and start with phone number one all
right so here we go with phone number
one
alright there's phone number one moving
right along to phone number two
and they respond number two on to phone
number three
okay the final phone phone number four
here we go
all right
so there we go that was all for phones
you guys just got to hear every single
phone that's on this table so now it's
up to you guys to guess which phone you
thought was which leave that comment in
the comment section below and again also
make sure to tell us which one you
thought was the best sounding phone not
just the one that you thought was the
loudest but one that you thought sounded
really good in terms of clarity and
things like that so leave that in the
comments section below and also if your
comment happens to be the same as
somebody else make sure to just like
that comment that way it makes it a
little bit easier for us to gather the
results and we're not just looking at a
bunch of the same comments so make sure
just thumbs up somebody's comment if
they have the same exact results as you
do but that's really it again we're
gonna reveal the answer in a later video
which we will also combine with some
scientific testing that we do with these
phones and we're compare that with what
you guys thought and see how similar and
different they are but that's really all
there is to it so hopefully you guys
enjoyed this video and found it somewhat
interesting it's a little bit different
from what we normally do but if you guys
enjoyed it we'll do more of this stuff
in the future but thank you so much for
