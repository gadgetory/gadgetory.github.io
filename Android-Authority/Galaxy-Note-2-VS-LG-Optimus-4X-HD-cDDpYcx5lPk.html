international version this is the LG
optimus 4x HD what I've actually my
personal favorites made by Korean
company LG obviously a massive
competitor to Samsung now just to give
you an idea what that's like in the hand
you know LG they have sort of a
rectangular type design that they've
taken Samsung is opting for more of a
smooth round curves type design now
we're looking at the Galaxy Note 2 here
which has a five and a half inch profile
it increased the screen size over the
galaxy note original galaxy know which
only had a 5.3 inch screen whereas this
one was a 5.5 as you can see that really
minimize the size of the bezel it's very
very similar in terms of this actual
design the galaxy student too many
devices here the galaxy s3 which
actually felt like a big device before
but it's not it's a dachshund how to's
is a big device that's not going to
appeal to everyone anyway so just in
terms of comparing it you notice the
obstinate 4x HD as we can see it's
really really similar in terms of its
width and thickness
but in terms of you know the actual
profile it's not that much larger you
know so both are packing pretty high res
displays differences is that this has a
2 gigabytes of RAM and it's also 1.6
gigahertz quad-core exynos chipset
whereas this is a taker 3 anyway we're
looking at the galaxy note 2 it's the
device everyone is really interested in
and there's a ton of the man that we're
seeing butter smooth operation with
Android 4.1 jelly bean out-of-the-box
and I mean take your pick push device do
you want to compare to the iphone and
what the most evil device ever devised
obviously not anyway this is gonna be a
hot seller guys it's got the s-pen we've
opened up the st gay they claim that
they really really up their efforts to
get developers on board and i think
we're gonna see a lot of good things
from samsung going forward anyway galaxy
note 2 here at Aoife berlin we're
reporting live from android authority my
name's Darcy thanks a lot guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
