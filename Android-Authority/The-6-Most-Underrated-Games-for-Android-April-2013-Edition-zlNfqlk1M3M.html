Hindy the android authority app guy
tired of playing and hearing about the
same old games over and over again I
know I am so in this video we'll be
showing you the six most under rated
games for android if there was something
that Android needed it was a Bomberman
game in case you weren't familiar
Bomberman was a classic video game where
bombs were used to kill bad guys and
navigate obstacles you earned points got
to new levels and even got some cooler
bombs bomb reggaeton aims to bring that
experience to Android it's a little
slower than a Bomberman style game
should be but it's still quite a bit of
fun it starts out slow but you'll be
dealing with maps full of bad guys in no
time there are a lot of levels a lot of
bombs and a lot of bad guys and pretty
much everything needed to make a decent
Bomberman game so it's definitely worth
checking out as far as racing games go
people seem to prefer the ones with
amazing graphics and real cars it's not
a bad concept to go with his gran
turismo has made quite the profit off of
doing just that however sometimes it's
fun to play a racing game that's a
little more simple and cracking sands
brings that kind of experience this is
essentially a go-kart racing game you
know if the go-karts are equipped with
nos and machineguns you race around a
track gunning down people in front of
you and using your nos to get an
advantage the graphics aren't the
greatest and the controls take some
getting used to but once you get past
the shaky learning process it's actually
a pretty fun game if you're looking for
a simple puzzle game that's actually a
lot of fun to play then graviton is one
to check out unlike most puzzle games
you can get through a whole bunch of
levels in a relatively short time span
the premise is that you have to get the
red balls off the screen without losing
any of the green balls what makes this
game so charming is that after each
round to tell you how you've compared
against the average whether you were
faster or slower how many tries it took
you and even how many players have made
it beyond that point since these kinds
of games are best for killing a few
minutes we can see this as being one of
the most underrated ways to kill some
time with the increasing number of good
action RPGs out there it's quite easy to
overlook raven sword it's not the
highest-rated out there and it's not the
most popular either however it does
contain most if not all of the elements
necessary to be an excellent game that's
also a lot of fun we believe where this
game made trip people up is the
beginning as many RPGs do Raven sword
starts out painfully slow and the
controls are a bit hard to master
however once you get used to everything
it's hard to put this game down and it
definitely belongs in the under eight
column this next game is gorgeous of
course we're talking about a game called
the room a mammoth success on iOS it
just hasn't garnered the same amount of
attention on Android and that's really a
shame it's a puzzle game or you must
explore an object and unlock all of its
secrets it really is quite difficult
we're not entirely sure why this game
isn't more popular on Android it's rated
very highly in the Google Play Store the
graphics are great the controls are
simple and the game is challenging
perhaps it's a lack of people talking
about it we don't know but we do know
that this is a highly recommended game
and definitely deserves more attention
sometimes it's fun to toss the same old
grinding out the window and just place
some in your face arcade style
awesomeness many games can help you
accomplish this but one that isn't so
well known as syder arcade HD this
action-packed side scroller takes you
back to the arcade days of gaming and
it's actually wildly fun you essentially
just shoot things that's right no
ridiculous plots no grinding for coins
gold crystals etc just you and
everlasting clip of ammo power-ups and
dozens and dozens of bad guys to kill
levels are long and challenging while
the gameplay is fast-paced and intense
its simplicity maybe what prevents it
from gaining more attention but if
you're in the mood to just shoot some
things give this one a try if you check
out our leaderboard you can see how all
these apps stack up against one another
really there are no winners or losers
here because these are games that
already got passed over in their
respective genres for more popular but
not necessarily better titles as usual
we don't have a ranking system these are
simply listed in order according to how
well they were rated in the Google Play
Store there is no bias on our part for
