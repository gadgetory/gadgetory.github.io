you can't figure out which one you like
best so what do you do you make them
fight that's what you do hey everybody
I'm Chris whoop now Samsung obviously
has the upper hand here when it comes to
marketing and general brand awareness
but take all that away and which phone
ends up on top well let's find out when
it comes to the specs for each phone
it's kind of a mixed bag for an example
let's look at the processors the galaxy
mega 6.3 as a higher clock processor at
1.7 gigahertz but it's only dual core
while the ascend mates 1.5 gigahertz
processor is quad-core the ascent mate
has two gigs of ram to the galaxy Mega's
1.5 gigs but the mega has more internal
storage both have 8 megapixel rear
facing cameras but the mega has a higher
pixel count in its front facing camera
looking at the design the galaxy mega
6.3 has a sleeker look in general with
its curves and its design that generally
right in line with the rest of the
current gen series of galaxy devices
it's also instantly recognizable as a
samsung phone just one that's a little
larger than most phones they carry the
huawei ascend mate on the other hand is
utilitarian almost to a fault well I
personally kind of like the stark
simplicity of the mate it's definitely
understandable that people might not be
too fond of it one point the mate does
have in its favor is that the plastics
used result in a much grippier field in
the mega 6.3 in the end the mega wins
this category but not exactly by leaps
and bounds in general I think most
people will prefer it but the mates
design does have its own sort of charm
both displays share the same general
size although the mega 6.3 screen is
just a tad bigger and both phones share
a 1280 by 720 resolution the ascent
mates slightly smaller screen gives it a
slight edge when it comes to pixel
density but the difference is so slight
that it's hard to imagine anyone really
noticing both devices use lcds for their
displays with the mega 6.3 using TFT
technology
and the ascend mate using IP s plus both
phones have fairly decent displays
especially since the viewing distance
isn't all that close if you do move
close enough pixelation is noticeable on
both devices though why you'd actually
be that close is another story while the
galaxy Mega's screen is just a tad
brighter the screen itself reflects
quite a bit of Sun making visibility
outside pretty difficult on the other
hand though the ascend mates display
isn't as bright it's much easier to see
outdoors the huawei ascend mate wins
this category for its outdoor visibility
and the slightly better viewing angle
afforded by the IPS plus display looking
at the performance for both phones it's
a mixed bag each does better in
different categories during our reviews
for each of these phones we ran antutu
benchmark tests the galaxy mega 6.3
ended up with an average score of 13,000
309 well the ascend mate did a little
bit better with a final score of 15,000
639 the table's turned when we moved on
to Epic Citadel however running
benchmark mode with the high quality
setting enabled the galaxy mega 6.3 got
an average frame rate of 57.4 frames per
second while the ascend mate struggled
ending up with just 37.7 frames per
second in real-world use the quad-core
processor in the ascend mate made
multitasking feel a bit snappier than
the dual-core mega 6.3 but when it came
to gaming the mega had a clear edge
performing much better in games like
real racing 3 when all is said and done
I'm calling this category at I because
each phone excelled in different areas
the galaxy mega runs the current version
of Android 4.2 point2 jellybean this is
skimmed over with the latest version of
Samsung's TouchWiz UI putting it right
in line with the current generation of
galaxy devices the ascend mate on the
other hand runs Android 4.1 point2 jelly
bean which is fairly recent but not the
way it is and greatest this is skin with
Huawei's emotion UI which might be a
little unfamiliar if you've used a lot
of other devices that run Android if
you've used the galaxy device in recent
years chances are good that you'll be
right
home with the mega 6.3 s interface as
samsung is pretty consistent even across
version updates the ascend mate on the
other hand might feel a little strange
especially the lack of an app drawer
instead everything is right on the home
screens this might feel weird at first
but the simplified approach may be a
nice change of pace for some people
neither phone has a lot of bloatware but
they do both have a suite of apps from
their respective manufacturers and a few
office and productivity options this
category goes to the mega 6.3 for its
combination of the most up-to-date
software and its familiar interface the
rear facing cameras are very similar in
each device and we're talking more than
just the fact that they're both 8
megapixels for the most part it was only
when I look really closely during a/b
tests that I could distinguish
differences between the two I used both
phones to take pictures of the same
subject the same distance away with both
phones on their default settings the
only change i made was to increase the
picture quality to the full 8 megapixels
on each phone both phones lead towards
the soft and fuzzy side when it comes to
the photos they capture the ascend mate
seems to lack a little color depth
compared to the mega 6.3 which tended to
produce pictures with a slightly richer
color 1080p video on each phone is
fairly sharp with no real difference
between the two aside from the colors
just like with the still pictures the
galaxy mega 6.3 wins this category
because it offers more camera features
than the ascend mate does when it comes
to the battery not only does the ascend
mate win this category but it whens it
goes home has a slack in an app comes
back and wins it again when we're
talking about the difference between the
4000 milliamp hour battery in the mate
and the 3200 milliamp hour battery in
the mega 6.3 it might not seem like much
they're both big numbers right well yeah
but think about the difference between a
2,000 milliamp hour battery and a 1200
milliamp hour battery which would you
prefer that said Samsung gets a nod for
having a removable battery in the mega
6.3 as big as the ascend mates battery
is you're stuck with it unless you want
to go rogue and change it the tough way
the bottom line is both of these
batteries will take you a long way but
the ascend mates battery will take you a
little further I'm calling this a tie of
sorts objectively speaking I think a lot
of people are going to prefer the mega
6.3 and it's a fine choice that said I
don't think a lot of devices really take
advantage of androids openness as a
platform as much as it could and while
ways definitely doing that here with the
ascend mate I think that's pretty cool
