Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Google Play weekly the
holidays are over CES is over things are
finally getting back to normal this week
we're going to be talking about
keyboards on smartwatches some really
awesome app releases and updates and a
whole lot more so let's get started last
week at CES nuance makers of the popular
swype keyboard brought their keyboard
along with a virtual assistant to
smartwatches and guess what it's not
that bad a couple of weeks ago flexi did
much the same thing but no one was
really keen on touch typing with a watch
the screen is very small and it's not
very ergonomic where swipe succeeds is
the ability to swipe out worth instead
of typing them and as you can see from
the video it looks a lot easier and more
accurate nuance is also shipping it with
the dragon voice assistant which can
compose messages make phone calls look
up movie times check the weather and
other basic voice commands they've also
added a song identify a feature where
you can ask dragon what song is playing
and it'll tell you so between that and
the swype keyboard it's a package of
apps that may actually be useful for
smartwatch owners late last week Google
Play services got a huge update to
version 4.1 among the many improvements
include better battery life and
turn-based multiplayer this is a
seriously huge and awesome update for
google play services aside from the
better battery life and turn-based
multiplayer the update brings a preview
for the Google Drive API that allows
developers to easily read and write
files to people's drive accounts it also
brings access to google mobile ads which
will help serve more relevant
advertisements and finally it improves
Google+ support my personal favorite
part of the update are the Google Drive
API and the turn-based multiplayer
support features at this point it's only
a matter of time before game devs allow
people to put an access save game files
on their Google Drive accounts instead
of their devices which will be awesome
the turn-based multiplayer will also
allow for more unique multiplayer game
types so stay on the lookout for that
swim key has been updating their app
continuously over the last six months or
so and in this latest huge update comes
new emojis some bug fixes and a number
of the changelog is actually really long
some of the things on it include the
after mentioned emoji UI overhaul along
with fixes various performance syncing
and freezing issues on many many devices
the other big improvement is the
addition of a number row that can be
enabled in the setting
up until Friday the only way to get it
was by going to the swiftkey beta site
and downloading it directly however word
around the interwebs is that the update
has started rolling out for the stable
version in the Google Play Store so if
you don't have it yet just hang tight
because it's coming here lately signage
amant has been extending their platform
through the development of applications
and recently they released gallery next
beta to the Google Play Store the idea
is to improve on the AOSP gallery app
that currently ships with cyanogenmod
which according to the CM team is
severely lacking in almost every
category they do this by recreating the
gallery in their own vision and it
includes a lot of new features including
gifs support video playback support
moments support cloud services
integration and a whole lot more you can
pick up the app by joining the gallery
next beta google+ community which you
can also find in our written companion
which is in the video description once
you join the beta program you can
download the app directly from the
google play store it's a fairly easy
process to go through in an excellent
opportunity to check out this awesome
new gallery app left up on our docket
this week is the release of Final
Fantasy 6 it's been a long time coming
for Square Enix fans and so far the
reviews have been mixed if you want to
see what we thought of it will have the
full review linked here at the end of
the video the game includes new touch
controls new graphics and revamped music
to try to make the new experience better
than the old one there were some
disappointing things and that's coming
from me the biggest final fantasy fan
boy in the entire Android blogging
community the biggest disappointments
include a lack of cloud save support and
always connected drm that prevents
offline play despite that the game has a
relatively high rating in the google
play store again if you want to see the
full review it'll be linked here at the
end of the video zoom us to see some
trending applications as usual if you
want to check any of these applications
out you can find the links in the briton
companion which is in the video
description first up this week is a
recommendation straight from google
called eternity warriors 3 like the two
that preceded it the third installment
is an action RPG where you play as one
of three heroes to battle a corrupted
dragon that's threatening your kingdom
it's getting popularity quickly and
features multiplayer support along with
decent graphics you can never have too
many options for file managers and
sliding Explorer is one that looks
pretty nice it adheres to most of the
standard Android design elements and
while it doesn't look as complexes es or
have as many features as explore it's a
solid offering for those who just need
to take a peek at their files if you're
itching for a new twitter client and
you've been shut out of carbon and
Falcon thanks to twitter
a token policy we recommend you give
towel and a shot it has a sleek design
some decent features and a lot more we
did a review of this app which we've
linked at the end of this video if
you're interested in seeing more details
you to me is a brand new application
that allows you to take educational
courses in a large variety of subjects
I've always had a soft spot for
responsibly done education apps and this
one has a lot of features and options
for people looking to extend their
knowledge keep an eye out because we
will be reviewing this one in the coming
days our last trending app this week is
the venerable zedge zedge received a
pretty decent update that brings back
the ability to save and store favorites
within the app and also add sorting in
my downloads and my favorites in
addition there are the standard bug
fixes and performance improvements this
should fix most of the problems people
were having with the apps new design
