Google pixel to Excel and for a number
of reasons I love the design and build
quality to the software Android 8.0 Oreo
is fantastic and three the camera is
absolutely incredible
it's easily the best camera on an
Android phone right now hands down and I
love it
so my pick for 2017 is going to have to
be the Google home Mini now I actually
haven't even opened this yet because
it's a Christmas gift and we're shooting
this before Christmas um but I know I'm
going to love it because it's all Google
assistant packed in a small tiny package
for less than $30 which is a really good
deal
hey everybody Joe hindiii here and my
favorite Android product of the year is
the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 after the
massive fiasco that ended up being a
meme that was the note 7 Samsung really
needed to hit the ground running this
year and I think they did a really good
job the phone covers the basics with
good performance excellent screen and
camera and also a decent design but
additionally it also came with almost
every power user feature that you can
think of including HDMI out an infrared
sensor an SD card slot ip68
certification S Pen and even though it's
not really a power user feature it also
comes with a headphone jack
20:17 was all about minimizing the
experience but Samsung went in the other
direction and included freaking
everything I love it it's a great phone
and is definitely my favorite Android
thing of 2017 the v30 came in a close
second my pick for the best of Android
2017 well I'm the weird phone guy so I'm
going with the ZTE axon M wait wait wait
come back this phone has flaws for sure
but the idea of what this phone could be
is just interesting enough to make it my
pick I'm not choosing this phone for
what it is certainly not I'm choosing it
for what it could be some day you know
not in 2017 but the journey of a
thousand miles begins with a first step
in the ZTE axon M
is that first step the best thing for me
to come out of 2017 was the Sonos one
speaker it has its quirks and annoyances
but when it comes down to it it's still
a sono speaker which means you're
getting good sound and great multi-room
connectivity plus it's smart with Amazon
Alexa now and Google assistant promised
to be coming soon for half the price of
a Google home max the Sonos one might be
the way to go if you want an assistant
in your home audio setup hey there guys
so my pick for 2017 has got to be the
honor 7x compared to other phones that
are similar asking price to get more
storage more ram a better screen I think
is the most awesome option start racking
so this allows us to take photos of star
trails to see the planet rotating around
this is a really impressive device my
favorite thing about Android this year
the pixel - of course between the camera
Hardware the fantastic archiving and
Google photos and all the little bits
that happen with Google assistant behind
the scenes Google has successfully drawn
me into its beautiful synergists
ecosystem of software and devices now
for me I could get everyone else onto
this phone hey guys johnathan fiest here
in 2017 is coming to a close and we're
talking about our favorite technology I
want it to say the DJI Matic pro but
this guy released in 2016 so I'm still
my favorite drone as far as phones go I
ended up with the Google pixel 2 XL
great phone I know there's lots of
complaints at the screen whatnot maybe
I'm lucky maybe I'm not as picky great
phone however a piece of tech I found
the most influencing on my life this
year was that right there the Panasonic
gh4 now shooting on that Google pixel to
excel so I can show you this guy the
Panasonic gh4 4k mirrorless camera quick
and easy to operate I'm pretty sure most
of our team is using it a bit a little
hand strap of course the quick-release
plate for the Manfrotto this machine has
upped my game I'm pretty sure it's up to
a lot of our players games a great
machine so there you have it in a year
filled with great new phones I'm
choosing the Panasonic gh4 the year
we'll see you all into
18 I left my pixel to excel I really do
it's got a beautiful display very clean
version of Android and a camera that can
capture my most precious moments but
recently I discovered a feature I've
just been dying to talk about the
headphone jack I've started to see a few
devices with it on the market and really
it seems like a wonderful piece of
technology maybe next year Google will
use this new innovation and I'll finally
be happy happy holidays everyone
