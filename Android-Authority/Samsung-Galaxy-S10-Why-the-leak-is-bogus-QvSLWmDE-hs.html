ice universe has published an image of
an unannounced bezel a smartphone that
some believed to be the galaxy s 10
prototype the image is published earlier
this week on Twitter alongside the
cryptic words quote this may be a design
beyond now some may interpret that as a
reference to the supposed rumored
codename of the Galaxy S 10 beyond the
phone does have a similar shape to the
Galaxy S 9 and s 9 plus and Samsung is
expected to make the S tens bezels even
thinner like seen in the image the
Galaxy S 10 could also use a discreet
camera system like the one in the Opel
find X and a sound emitting display
removing the requirements of a
front-facing camera and speaker now with
that being said this probably isn't an S
10 prototype and here are some clues
there are a couple of odd reflections on
the lower mid left and bottom right and
the artifacts across the bottom of the
display are suspicious and we rarely see
leaked images this soon before devices
potential loss possibly in February 2019
for prototype units the first photo of
the galaxy s seven arrived around a
month before its release the first photo
of the s8 appeared around two months
before its release and the first photo
of the s nine popped up roughly two
months before its release and trusted
Android leaker on lakes also hinted that
the image was a bit sketchy
laugh-out-loud
leaked and to be fair ice universe
didn't actually say that this was the
s10 prototype the use of beyond in the
tweet could be coincidental or the
result of machine translation from
Chinese in fact on his way Bowl page ice
universe used a caption that translates
roughly to quote this is the next step
therefore going from this is the next
step to this is the s10 prototype is
quite a leap of faith what do you think
let me know in the comments below or on
Twitter I want to hear it do you think
that the s10 will look like this or are
you thinking hey come on I'm looking for
the note this summer this is just too
early to even talk about let me know I
want to hear it
