Authority and several tablets this year
have made an attempt to become more than
just a tablet and Google's latest
creation is one of them despite running
Android can actually be a viable
alternative to a laptop or computer
let's find out what the picks will see
so if you couldn't already tell the
pixel C looks a lot like the Chromebook
pixel that's because it was designed by
the pixel team and if you pair it with
the optional keyboard it literally looks
like a miniature Chromebook pixel when
you boil it all down I guess you could
say that this is just another ordinary
Android tablet and technically it is but
it's one extremely beautiful looking
tablet it's got that iconic minimalistic
pixel design from the brushed aluminum
build all the way down to the
multicolored LED light bar on the back
just like the Chromebook pixel you can
use the light bar to check the battery
status by knocking on it it's not the
lightest tablet in the world but it
feels absolutely solid every inch of
this tablet feels very well put together
and it just screams high quality the
power and volume keys which are also
made of metal are very clicky tactile
and easy to press then you have the dual
speakers on opposing sides of the tablet
that are very beautifully machined right
into the frame you've also got these
standard 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
on the upper right side and just like
the Chromebook pixel the pixel C
utilizes the new USB type-c standard for
charging and syncing if you want to get
the most out of the pics we'll see
you'll have to spring for the additional
keyboard the keyboard attaches by some
very strong magnets and you can angle
the tablet as you see fit it does not
however close like a laptop in order to
close it you have to break it apart and
then put the tablet face down on the
keyboard and to open it up again you
have to slide the tablet away from the
keyboard if you want to use the pixel C
as a tablet without detaching the
keyboard entirely you can hook it onto
the back of the tablet but this does
make the pixel C quite heavy and thick
and a little cumbersome to use if you're
holding it for more than just a few
minutes the keyboard isn't a full size
keyboard but it's actually pretty easy
to type on the keys are spacious with a
very good amount of travel and there's
decent separation between the
keys that they're easy to find and
identify by feel even though it connects
via bluetooth you can only type on it
when the keyboard is magnetically
attached to the tablet along the hinge
which is great for preventing any
unwanted keystrokes the coolest thing
about this keyboard though is that it
gets its power from the tablet when you
close it all up it begins to charge
wirelessly so you're not having to deal
with any additional cables just to
charge the keyboard if there was a
downside of this keyboard it's the fact
that it's literally just a keyboard you
won't find any Android shortcut keys or
a trackpad so the majority of your
interaction is still going to be through
touch and that kind of makes the
experience feel a little bit disjointed
and aside from the physical typing
you're not really getting any extra
value or functionality out of this
keyboard on the front of the pics we'll
see is a ten point two inch display and
just like the rest of the tablet it's
absolutely top-notch
it's an LCD display with a resolution of
2560 by 1800 and it looks fantastic it's
super sharp and easy to read colors are
vibrant and saturated without being
overly so and it gets bright enough that
you'd use the tablet outdoors if you
wanted the large screen is great for web
browsing watching YouTube or the
occasional movie and gaming which is
always a lot of fun on such a large
screen it also features an aspect ratio
of the square root of two which gives
you plenty of width for consuming
content in both portrait and landscape
orientation inside it's being powered by
a Tegra x1 chip with three gigs of RAM
which is plenty of power for any tablet
especially one running a stock Android
experience swiping and scrolling through
the UI or various applications like the
web browser is very smooth and it
performs like an absolute champ when
playing graphically demanding games or
quickly jumping back and forth between
applications the only time this tablet
ever stuttered or slowed down was when
using the keyboard sometimes the key
presses would lag behind by several
strokes and this happened most
frequently in Google Docs the pics we'll
see is where I originally started
writing this review but eventually had
to move on to another machine that
didn't have troubles keeping up with my
typing the pixel C comes in either 32 or
64 gigs of storage but there's no option
to expand so what you see is what you
get but I would imagine these two
storage capacities will be more than
enough for most users
dual speakers on the pixel see while not
front-facing still sound amazing
they're super loud and the audio is
crisp and clean that you'll never feel
the need to plug in a pair of headphones
it really makes things like YouTube
movies games and streaming audio a much
better experience on a tablet and the
speakers are positioned well enough that
you don't have to worry about muffling
them with your hands now I'm not the
lightest user when it comes to tablets
but battery life on the pixel C has been
solid ranging anywhere between 12 to 15
hours on a single charge I mostly play
games and watch YouTube on tablets so I
can burn through the battery life pretty
easily but the pixel C can make it
through a full day on heavy usage with
no problems at all if your usage is
anything like mine you'll most likely be
charging it every night but I have no
doubt that lighter users can squeeze a
good several days out of it before
having to recharge tablet cameras have
never really been much to write home
about and that isn't changing anytime
soon with the pixel C the software is
the standard Google camera with all the
usual modes that you might expect like
lens blur panorama and photosphere
but taking photos on a tablet is still
an awkward experience especially in
public you probably won't be taking too
many photos with it but you totally can
if you have to it's got a 2.1 megapixel
camera on the front which is serviceable
for the occasional tablet selfie and
video chats and the eight megapixel
camera on the rear is nothing special
but can get the job done if you're in a
pinch daylight photos are decent looking
as expected but once you get into
low-light situations the photos begin to
fall apart with a lot of noise and very
little detail again the photos are
serviceable if it's the only camera you
have but it's nothing to get overly
excited about the pics we'll see is
being marketed as a product that can be
a lot of fun but also great for
productivity at the same time it's
running Android 6.0 marshmallow so
you're getting all of Google's latest
and greatest features like doze
user-defined app permissions and now on
tap the experience is as pure as you can
get but there are a few minor
differences on the pixel seed that you
won't find on Nexus devices first off
the placement of the notification shade
is contingent on where you swipe down on
the display and the Android soft keys
have been split to the bottom left and
right corners of the screen which
most likely done to prevent you from
having to reach over the top of the
keyboard to press them otherwise this is
the same stock Android experience that
you come to know and love from Nexus
devices it is definitely possible to be
productive on the Android OS you can
crunch out emails right at Word
documents and create spreadsheets but
without split-screen multitasking it's
not exactly easy to do two things at
once if you only have to work on one
task at a time it's not a big deal but
constantly jumping back and forth
between apps can start to feel
cumbersome when you're trying to work on
multiple projects at a time the biggest
problem that Android still faces is a
lot of applications aren't optimized for
tablet use many apps like Instagram and
snapchat or just blown up versions of
the phone app and apps that don't
support landscape orientation can be
awkward to use when you have the pixel C
paired up with the keyboard Android is a
great operating system as a whole and
marshmallow is the best version of
Android we've seen from Google today but
it still has a long ways to go before it
can become an OS built for hardcore
productivity the pixel C starts off at
$4.99 for the 32 gigabyte version and
goes up an extra hundred dollars for
double the storage if you offer the
keyboard that will cost you an
additional 150 bucks it can get pretty
expensive rather quickly but depending
on how much you value the beautiful
pixel Hardware you might find it to be
worth the cost so the final verdict here
is the pixel C is awesome as a tablet it
is hands-down the most beautiful and
well-built
Android tablet on the market and it's a
lot of fun to use especially for things
like gaming and the occasional movie
however the fact that it's running
Android instead of something like Chrome
OS doesn't make the most ideal
productivity device it isn't offering
much more functionality than what you
would get from another Android tablet
with an added keyboard sure you can
crunch some emails and Word documents
but you're not going to be able
multitask like you would on a computer
or laptop or even do something as
hardcore as editing video with rumors of
Android and having things like
split-screen multitasking maybe in the
future the pics we'll see could totally
be that productivity machine that Google
wants to be but it isn't quite there yet
