going on everybody and here we are at
Google i/o 2015 and I'm actually here to
show you a brand new app or rather
ecosystem even that was just released
and announced at Google i/o keynote and
it is of course Google Photos you can
see that I already have it downloaded
and it actually is occupying its own
home screen right now on my s6 edge but
the Google Photos went live and you can
find it at photos google.com on a
desktop on your laptop or anything and
it is a lot like it's really a it's a
very Google stylistic let's say Flickr
page you will have some tools there for
editing and it will show all of your
photos there as well but here is the
splash screen for the first boot up as
you can see there and it looks already
pretty nice what we have here
essentially is just a place to be able
to upload and store all of your photos
and videos from the beginning of time
and for all of the future you will be
able to download a version of Google
photos onto your smartphones or tablets
and also on the desktop now the desktop
also comes with a standalone uploader
which will automatically upload photos
from your my pictures folder from your
downloads folder pretty much anything
that you would pick and which is
important to me because I take
screenshots on my laptop all the time
and I would love for those to be backed
up much like on Dropbox so I can always
create a folder that the screenshots end
up going to and then it will
automatically upload them to Google
photos and you can see the splash screen
right now backed up safely always stored
and you will be able to organize and
label them accordingly so we're gonna go
ahead and get started I'm gonna go ahead
and back up and sync and only backup
when Wi-Fi is available for mine
high-quality now this is the kicker
right here high quality images are going
to be stored but they will be at a
reduced file size but if you really
wanted to put full resolution or even
full RAW files for example or full 4k of
video files you would have to use
whatever storage you have paid for or
have on Google Drive and you can always
pay for more if it came down to it in my
case I have a 100 gigabyte storage
promotion going on so that's why I have
140
we'll go ahead and hit to go forward you
can always pinch-to-zoom and you can go
for months or go into the weeks or days
and whatnot
you can select things quicker by
pressing hold and then swiping downward
in order to select everything which i
think is a functionality that should be
in all all Android devices no matter if
it's in the gallery or whatnot you can
navigate from left to right to different
collections and different types of
categorizations Google Play services
stop which is unfortunate but anyway you
can also find faster by searching now
searching there's also categorized
contextually so that what you'll be able
to do is look up pictures of dogs so
you'll look up pictures of you playing
baseball you'll look up pictures based
upon the geo-tagging of a photo for
example on the desktop version and I'll
show it to you right here as well I do
already have some pictures that are
showing up from the last week or so now
the photos assistant is what is going to
be in the assistant page the first page
now is over all the way on the left and
it will give you a look at the different
types of photos and videos that are put
together into little memories packages
which is really nice so I'll go and
swipe that away and you're also gonna
backup different device folders little
bag of folders like downloads and
screenshots like I mentioned to you was
already available in the desktop version
which is great so we're gonna go from
here
photos collections it is still
aggregating all of my photos from from
the cloud from my Google
Plus page already so there we go now we
have in search the ability to look for
faces now people from all over my walks
of life have appeared on here even some
pictures from various screen shots I
took you can see that the Joker's face
is right there so pretty much any face
that comes up in your photos I as
prominent will be able to show up
automatically and you'll be able to
easily find pictures of those people
like for example we even have pictures
of Darci here and we're going to see
pictures of them in here as well now
we're going to see pictures of even just
me I'm always going to be the first one
that's available there and really
they're just easy ways of finding extra
people you can also go to places and
this is where things get geotagged
you'll have geo tags photoes from Los
Angeles Pasadena places I've been to
Singapore even and if I were to search
for a photo or rather let me hit Search
let's say I wanted to search for Seattle
this this example I already found on my
desktop these were all photos that were
geo tagged in Seattle but not only that
the word landmarks from Seattle like the
Pike Place Market the Space Needle which
is this picture right here where I was
actually on the Space Needle that I took
there that are all categorized under the
Seattle search and things like pictures
of food I'll have all of my foodie
pictures in this particular category and
I take quite a lot of them as you've
seen in my camera shoot outs and the sky
types videos creations even photos that
are just in my Google Drive so on the
desktop it looks about as simple as it
does right here with the menu over on
the side even the even the editing tools
are pretty simple you'll be able to
you'll be able to crop your photos and
if you wanted to you can tag photos via
the descriptions of them so if I were to
hold on here oops
I were to press on here and then open
here I can add info into the details if
I wanted to on at least on the desktop
version I don't see why I don't
right here right now but really that's
just a quick look at Google photos it's
a brand new ecosystem that has one major
trait to it the fact that you can upload
all of your photos and videos to it I'll
be a tad maybe a slightly smaller file
size hopefully not enough to detract
from the quality of the photo but you
can do it unlimited and absolutely free
Google photos is a pretty nice ecosystem
it's almost like Google Place Hulu play
music from two years ago they're hoping
that this will be the end-all be-all for
a lot of people who are hoping to safely
backup all of the memories to the cloud
nonetheless this is Joshua Vergara from
Android auto reporting to you live from
Google i/o 2015 here at the Moscone
Center in San Francisco California keep
it tuned here for even more because we
argue our source for all things Google
i/o</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
