which seems to be a trend lately they
actually threw in a pair of premium
earbuds in with every phone so instead
of getting a crappy pair of gas-station
gummies you actually get these opinion
by AKG which is a pretty well known and
trusted audio manufacturer they meet
somewhere in between cheap and premium
which considering that they cost $99
alone makes sense the earbuds and
control module are made of a glossy hard
plastic and the earbuds have an angled
tip to them that shoots sound down into
your ears just a little bit better they
don't offer the best noise isolation so
you're still going to hear the people
next to you and your commute unless you
swap out the ear tips of something a
little better than the plastic ones that
they come with but they do have a solid
feeling mic and remote it's thin and
does a good job of staying out of the
way without weighing down the ear buds
and the buttons are super clicky I was
never left wondering if I actually click
the button or not the growing trend in
smartphones seems to be removing the
headphone jack for some reason but as
you mentioned earlier Samsung kept a
standard on the Galaxy S 8 thank God you
can plug into anything that has a 3.5
millimeter input be it your phone gaming
console or musical instrument with a
name like AKG attached to these
headphones I was expecting the sound
quality to really impress me but they
were kind of a mixed bag they said to be
warned these might not be for you so
there is a pretty good low-end there
isn't too much detail and they're also
not overpowering they stay nicely
beneath the mids but gritty basses like
the one in vanish in our sleep by Rob
Roy sounds more like your average bass
guitar it just loses a bit of death</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
