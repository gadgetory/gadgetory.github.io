brought to you by domain.com
so asus argues that if you consider
buying a Gold Edition Apple watch you
were out of your mind but let's consider
that if you're a billionaire and have
the cheddar why not buy a Gold Edition
Apple watch well it is a flashy way to
announce to the world that you are among
the upper echelon you are among the
one-percenters and you look like a
douche bag I mean why would I want to
flaunt around an Apple logo just to
demonstrate that that's the most
expensive device in that category so
let's start off with a quick overview of
the Apple watch versus Android we're
starting with the software both
operating systems have been built around
smart phone notifications and a
selection of apps designed specifically
for wearables Android wear arranges
these into swappable cards while Apple's
OS arranges apps on a single home screen
with fullscreen pop-up notification
however rather than relying solely on a
touch to navigate your way around
Apple's crown dial is also used to hop
in and out of apps and alter some
settings Apple made a big deal about
personalization during the announcement
and both platforms offer up a wide
selection of watch faces to choose from
you can already find a huge range of
watch faces made by third-party
developers for Android wear core
functionality also shares a lot of
similarities on both platforms
notifications pane from your mobile
appear in real time allowing for quick
responses to messages emails calls etc
both platforms support common
applications such as calendars
navigation music control whether
checking upcoming flight information and
voice commands
speaking of which Google now plays a big
part in Android wear while Suri assumes
the voice responsibilities for Apple
watch
Google now works for search accessing
apps setting alarms etc and Suri allows
for much of the same functionality and
can be activated by voice command Apple
pay is one big feature currently
unmatched by Android wear devices which
will allow you to make small payments in
some stores directly from
wrists although you do have to hold the
face of the watch against the
contactless reader which might involve
some odd wrist twisting depending on the
reader the other half of the wearables
battle is being fought on the health and
fitness market while both platforms
offer up a lot of similar functionality
most Android wear smartwatches come with
a heartrate monitor and a link up to
your smartphone to track location and
distances the Apple watch comes with a
heart rate monitor and built-in GPS like
some more of the recent gen Android wear
devices such as the Sony SmartWatch 3
which means that you can leave your
phone at home while going out for a run
with Android wear their support for
google fit and a selection of
third-party apps that can all tap into
the fitness hardware most of which
offers features like distance step
tracking and health monitoring apple's
activity app can also track your
day-to-day activities or lack thereof in
much of the same way although there are
plenty of different designs to pick from
with Android wear most of the latest
generation smartwatches feature
surprisingly similar specifications the
tablet here gives an example of some of
the best Android wear products and how
they compare with key hardware features
offered by Apple's watch one of the most
important metrics for wearable is the
battery life typically our testing of
Android wear devices results in a
maximum battery life of around 2 days
with the exception of the Moto 360 which
seems substantially worse during the
Apple announcement the device was stated
to last 18 hours during quote typical
usage meaning that daily charging will
be required for the watch and may not
last under heavy usage the Apple watch
supports wireless charging via a MagSafe
induction connection the Moto 360 uses
Qi wireless charging while most Android
wear products are charged through a
physical connection to a docking station
on its debut into the SmartWatch market
Apple also launched a sport and
collector's edition neither of these two
add anything in terms of internal
hardware but the sports version is
aluminum rather than stainless steel
prices for the watch range from 500 $49
to 1,000 $49 depending on the strap and
build materials and
you have money to burn there is also an
18 karat or rose gold option available
starting from $10,000 now on the other
hand most of the Android wear watches
are significantly cheaper my G watch was
about $200 and does most of the same
things so I know last week I botched the
