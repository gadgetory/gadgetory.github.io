Josh regard from Android 30 what's going
on everybody and this is the Samsung
Galaxy s5 versus the Apple iPhone 5s
it's quite literally more of the same in
both cases with these phones when it
comes to design and quite literally in
the case of the iPhone 5s which features
the same body as its predecessor the
iPhone 5 most of the changes are in
terms of internal hardware with the only
noticeable outward changes being the
introduction of a fingerprint scanner
integrated into the physical home button
which results in a nice-looking chrome
ring around the home button and the rear
camera now coming with a dual LED flash
that being said expressing
disappointment at this isn't
particularly just as we all know that
this is exactly what Apple does with
every S iteration of their smart phone
making a return is an elegant classy
metal unibody design that definitely
feels like a premium device now I could
actually pretty easily repeat the same
line above for the Samsung Galaxy s5 and
pretty much get away with it it features
a similar form factor to its predecessor
and other than the obligatory specs bump
the noticeable outward change is a
fingerprint scanner integrated with a
physical home button but that's not all
the capacitive keys flanking the home
button are back but this time the Menu
key has been replaced by a more helpful
recent apps key
the other major change with the galaxy
s5 is of course the much talked-about
back cover made of a soft touch plastic
with a perforated or dimpled design love
it or hate it it's entirely up to you
but when it comes to Samsung's design
policies any change is a much needed
change and the move away from glossy
plastic is still certainly very welcome
now when it comes to size the Galaxy s5
is obviously in a class of its own
compared to the much smaller iPhone 5s
which is essentially dwarfed by the 5.1
inch screen found on the Samsung
flagship however when it comes to
handling the galaxy s5 is pretty much
the most accessible 5-inch screen device
out there I'll mean while the iPhone 5s
will feel that home in any hand and
pockets it comes down to whether or not
you want a certain amount of screen real
estate on the devices and you have to
know what the handling will be like as a
result speaking of those screens at
is quite hard to compare the two given
the 1.1 inch difference between them
which results in a much larger surface
for the Galaxy s5 the 4 inch display of
the iPhone 5s has been praised by
experts for its accurate color
reproduction brightness and viewing
angles and it does a fantastic job but
Apple has used the same Retina display
as found in the iPhone 5 in its latest
flagship with a resolution of 11 36 by
640 resulting in a pixel density of 326
PPI on the other hand the samsung galaxy
s5 features a 5.1 inch Super AMOLED
display with a 1080p resolution and a
much higher pixel density of 432 pixels
per inch as we mentioned a number of
times in previous reviews and
comparisons the colors on this display
absolutely pop and as I put it they
really pop out of the screen and punch
you in the face and the bright and
colourful TouchWiz UI really shines
through nowadays in the smartphone game
we do have to generally give the nod to
larger screen experiences when it comes
to media consumption experiences after
all our smartphones are really becoming
where we look at all of our media
whether it's movies or playing games and
a four inch screen on the iPhone 5s just
might not provide that experience that
you're looking for yes it does get nods
for ease of use and pocket ability but
once you try a larger screen you might
find that the dwarfed screen of the
iPhone 5s just isn't what you're looking
for because the larger screen is much
more fun now as we move on to
performance we find that a straight up
specs comparison might not necessarily
be very fair because both devices cater
to very different ecosystems so
real-world performance is what we'll
talk about iOS is known for its fluid
animation and impressive optimization
and while iOS 7 may have had its issues
a lot of the kinks have been worked out
with the update to 7.1 the iPhones UI
sails through most tasks and what the
processor that is significantly faster
than was found in its predecessor the
iPhone 5s does really well in terms of
performance in real-world usage the
Samsung Galaxy s5 on the other hand
features the best processing package
currently available in the Android arena
the snapdragon 801 processor clocked in
at 2.5 gigahertz backed by the audrina
330 and 2 gigabytes of RAM
now TouchWiz also has had its issues in
the past with stutter and
in previous iterations but as we have
found in the galaxy s5 you'll rarely if
ever see a hiccup performance is as
smooth as it has ever been and the
device easily handles anything you can
throw at it now especially because of
the drastically different architectures
both groups of users should have
absolutely no complaints when it comes
to the performance of either smartphone
in this versus now if it came down to
the sheer number of hardware features
available we would have to say that the
Galaxy s5 would hands-down take the lead
after all it comes with everything from
NFC to a micro SD card reader an IR
blaster along with the newly added heart
rate monitor so the galaxy s5 really
tries to pack it all of course wear and
tear of the internal hardware will be at
a minimum for the galaxy s5 courtesy of
its ip67 rating the iPhone 5s seems
quite limited when it comes to its
hardware capabilities but having it all
doesn't necessarily make it the best and
it really comes down to how useful you
actually find all of the various
features offered on the Samsung flagship
in the first place and as mentioned
earlier both phones integrate
fingerprint scanners which serve a
similar purpose which is to add an extra
level of security the galaxy s5 finger
scanner is a swipe type which means you
need to swipe across the physical home
button from top to bottom which then
unlocks your device the iPhone 5s is a
press type scanner which means that you
can just hold your finger to the scanner
for a successful reading now the usage
of both scanners is quite limited for
now but we will say that the potential
is there now when it comes to battery
life you might find that the unit inside
of the iPhone 5s seems a little bit
meagre at 1560 milliamp hours however
we'd always did find that it was able to
get through a full day's of work and
play without much fuss at all but I will
say this we all know those iPhone users
that walk around maybe somewhere in the
middle of the day asking hey does
anybody have a charger on the other hand
the Samsung Galaxy s5 with its decent
twenty eight hundred million power unit
does quite well in the battery life
Department also helped along by
fantastic power saving modes including
an ultra mode that strips down the UI to
a grayscale bare-bones version the
battery of the galaxy s5 is also
removable which gives you the
opportunity to carry around the spare so
ultimately when it comes to the hardware
department we find that the iPhone 5s is
really a what-you-see-is-what-you-get
experience but that experience is also
pretty
damn good in its own right on the other
hand the Samsung Galaxy s5 does try to
do everything at once it tries to be
more than just your smartphone and
whether or not is even very great at any
one of those things is up for debate
but it kind of depends on what kind of
experience you want if you want all of
the tools that are available inside of
the hardware of the galaxy s5 then it's
the one for you otherwise you can still
get a good experience with the
what-you-see-is-what-you-get experience
of the iPhone 5s and now we move on to
cameras in which we start with Samsung's
new 16 megapixel ISO cell camera which
shows the company seriousness in giving
you the best smartphone camera
experience available and you do get high
quality vivid photos with very good
detail in the app Samsung did away with
the sheer amount of features that were
available in the galaxy s4 before it and
instead added in a couple of key new
ones live HDR and selective focus and
even if the latter is a little hit and
miss at times when executed properly it
actually does give you some pretty great
looking quality photos that have a
little bit of style to them diving
further into the camera app opens a
world of options allowing you to tweak
the camera experience to really suit
your needs the image quality is good and
retains its sharpness even after zooming
in but as is to be somewhat expected
that is not the case for every photo
low-light photography has improved but
there's still a fair amount of grain as
is expected and overall the various
features and customizations and the more
than decent quality images will ensure a
great experience with regards to the
Galaxy s5 camera now when it comes to
the Apple side of things the prowess of
the 8 megapixel rear shooter of the
iPhone 5s is very well documented and
while it doesn't even come close to the
number of features found in the galaxy
s5 it does come with some interesting
ones that include auto HDR but that is
the main gripe regarding the iPhone
camera it really doesn't give them any
options at all the modes operate at in
particular aspect ratios without too
many extra bells and whistles and then
that's about it perhaps it is a strength
for the iOS camera however that even if
you can't really alter the experience
the resulting images are often pretty
great now if you want the ability to
cater the experience of the smartphone
camera to your liking the Galaxy s5 is
probably more the one for you but if you
just want to set it and forget it we do
give the nod to the iPhone 5
s because it still does provide the
quality over although we can pretty much
put these two phones neck-and-neck
because Samsung's approach to the camera
really improves the Android smartphone
camera game while the iPhone 5s
continues the tradition that Apple has
been able to withhold with its camera
optics and finally we make it to
software in which both iterations of the
operating systems were quite hyped for
supposedly bringing great changes to
their respective formulas only to end up
changing a few things but ultimately
maybe feeling too familiar still iOS
received its big revamp last year moving
to a flat bright and more abstract
interface the Retina display is
definitely well-suited for the far more
colorful UI and iOS 7 is definitely a
lot sleeker cleaner and brighter than
its previous Edition and then added in
was easy access to a control center
utilized by swiping up anywhere on the
screen which gives you access to
controls for the music player the
brightness settings quick apps like the
torch and calculator and of course
connectivity toggles the Notification
Center is more customizable as well and
let you choose what other information
you'd like to see on it like stocks the
weather and more regardless of any
aesthetic differences you still get the
simplistic but fast operating system
that does suffer from some limitations
that may prove frustrating for Android
users who probably are expecting a
little bit more out of their user
interfaces and actually for even some
iPhone users out there the experience
has pretty much remained the same as it
was before even with these subtle
changes now on the other hand Samsung
continues to add even more to an already
saturated software experience with
features like the multi window returning
and then some new ones being added in
like a tool box and even a download
booster and then an updated s health app
that takes advantage of the heart rate
monitor but much of what you remember
about TouchWiz returns with a big
aesthetic change being the Notification
Center and settings menus that get a
circle motif another change is the
inclusion of the my magazine a second
screen that is meant to serve as a news
and social media aggregator but piggy
backs off of Flipboard and ultimately
ends up feeling like an additional step
between you and the already powerful
Flipboard app and as was the case with
previous Samsung releases there's always
something new but eventually it probably
will lose its shine sometimes quite
quickly and you're once again back to
ultimately the all-too-familiar TouchWiz
UI now you've heard me use the term
before a galaxy syndrome to describe the
features in the software and also in the
hardware that while they might be cool
at first day slowly wane in terms of
their luster on the other hand iPhone
users can kind of say the same thing
about their phone as well because while
it did get a big aesthetic change its
function is pretty much largely remain
the same and that's the whole experience
remain the same I won't say that the
galaxy s5 is the multitasking powerhouse
compared to the iPhone 5s and iOS 7 but
you should be able to get a lot done
whether it's work or play on either of
these flagship smartphones it's just a
matter of which one you wish to choose
and which Avenue you wish to take to get
to where you need to go now while the
Galaxy s5 is a recent release and thus
will come at the premium price point for
two-year contracts on all the major
carriers which is around $1.99 with a
two-year contract you can find the
iPhone 5s for lower prices pretty much
all around the board because it has been
out for a little bit longer by now and
so there you have it the Samsung Galaxy
s5 versus the iPhone 5s obviously this
is a comparison that many of you are
going to be making out there if you're
looking between Android and Apple
ecosystems now if you're coming into
these devices with fresh eyes it really
is up to you whether Android or Apple's
iOS are better for you it really kind of
comes down to that but what we are
saying here is for those users who have
used the previous versions of these
phones before you're not looking at too
many changes and these phones are pretty
much what you would want to get if you
want it to be on the bleeding edge for
new users out there though you have your
pick of two of the best smartphones
available in the market today overall
these are the Titans of the smartphone
game at the moment but don't forget that
there are other Android flagships that
can hold their own like the HTC One m8
the Sony Xperia z2 and we have even more
coming in the upcoming months so stay
tuned to Android thority for coverage of
these and other phones beyond and also
don't forget to drop us likes on our
videos because we'd love to see those
thumbs up hit that subscribe button and
then when you're done with all that hit
up Android authority calm because we are
