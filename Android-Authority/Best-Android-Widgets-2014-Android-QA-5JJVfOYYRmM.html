Jace and this is where we try and answer
your most pressing Android questions but
today we're gonna start by asking you a
question for example what I want to
complete a task with my phone I have to
do the following find the app select the
app wait for the app to load and then
select the content or tasks that I want
to complete with that app but what if I
told you you could do all of this in one
step
widgets baby widgets that's right today
is all about widgets widgets widgets and
to start off we're gonna answer some
common questions regarding widgets
starting with battery drain some of you
are saying chase those widgets are a
foul on my battery well yes and maybe
not so so if you are using a Facebook or
Twitter app that has to constantly ping
the server side to refresh that data yes
that is gonna drain your battery if you
want to live feed within your widget but
most widgets like my audible app work
Google keep for example or a Flipboard
app is not painting back server-side
frequently enough to drain your battery
in any significant way
so most widgets are not a battery drain
who's going to be clear careful on which
widgets you employ so yes let's start
off with battery widget reborn and for
those of you who are battery management
geeks this is gonna get you excited you
can track your battery usage temperature
of the device battery history and you
can even set up more advanced power
saving functions additionally the widget
is very customizable there is an ongoing
notification in your notification panel
that is highly customizable also there
is a widget you can set up on your home
screen which has quite a few
customizable options as well including
changing the color of the widget and how
much space it takes up a 2x2 or 4x4 move
it on to clock now and as the name
suggests clock now has a very Google now
like theme so if you're looking to spice
up your homescreen with an authentic
Google look you will love this widget
right off the bat there is also a bit of
customization that can be tinkered with
you can set up for different background
options and two color options for the
text in addition to the clock this
particular widget will also allow you to
see quick weather information and an
icon of your choice the icon acts as an
alternative to toggle off your Wi-Fi
connection if you're looking for more
toggle spaces than just one clock now
provides you with up to six spaces
moving on to a popular calendar widget
called digit cow Digital offers a lot of
different styles and options it has just
about everything you think a calendar
widget should have full screen month you
check a two by four day by day widget
check the widget also has a neutral
color so you shouldn't have any
conflicts with other themes on top of
that you are able to control the
transparency all in all it's a beautiful
widget and unlike a lot of other apps
and widgets
it has tablets support moving on to what
is likely the most popular widget on the
Google Play Store that is HD widgets and
we think there's two reasons for its
success the first reason is that HD
widgets is one of the few true widget
apps to have an extremely wide range of
widget configurations it has literally
everything toggle clocks weather data
date widgets you name it the majority of
these widget configurations can be
combined as well the second reason for
its wild success is the sheer amount of
customization that HD widgets offers you
can tell this is a really good widget
app when you can spend 20 minutes
configurating the widget to just your
liking each individual widget can be
customized in a number of ways you can
change the color of the text background
colors and clock colors so what kind of
widgets if any would help you and your
Android experience the thing I love
about my Audibel widget and my Google
keep widget and my Flipboard widget
combined with Google now is that it
minimizes that the steps the finger
jumping that I need to do to complete
the tasks and get to the content that I
want
so what widgets would help you let me
know in the comments below thanks for
watching android army my name is Jase

forget about our Android Authority
