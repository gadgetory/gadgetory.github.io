episode along with some additional
add-ons the game is expensive at $19.99

Fault Street storm racing is the latest
game in the popular racing franchise
this one doesn't play like the others
instead players will be drag racing it
features four player PvP races and you
can also bet money on each race to try
to win more additionally the game
introduces weather elements to make the
races a little bit harder the game is
off to a rough start and that's a little
unusual because asphalt games generally
do better on release however we're sure
it'll work out the kinks eventually keep
your eye on this one the Elder Scrolls
Legends is Bethesda's new card game it
has a similar mechanic to games like
clash Royale and hearthstone you'll
collect cards build a deck and duel
opponents for supremacy there is a
fairly robust campaign online PvP and
even some MOBA elements cards can also
level up to become more powerful over
time but des des came out swinging with
this one and they ended up doing a
pretty good job it's a worthy competitor
to the existing card
electing games farming simulator 18 is
the latest game in the franchise your
goal is to build and maintain a farm the
game gives you over 50 machines in order
to do so and players can grow and sell
six different kinds of crops produce
milk and wool from cows and sheep and
even breed pigs to sell you can even
hire helpers to help you do things
around the farm there is local
multiplayer over Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
where friends can play together the game
has a few early bugs it's otherwise
pretty Pleasant it runs for $4.99 with a
few cheap in-app purchases ghouls and
ghosts mobile is a port of the classic
arcade game the game is essentially the
same as its arcade version from years
ago you play as a knight your goal is to
slaughter a bunch of ghouls ghosts and
other monsters the mobile version does
have some improvements the gameplay
mechanics are objectively better than
the arcade version
additionally there are two difficulty
modes more gear and more boss fights it
has a few bugs but nothing serious
it'll run you a dollar ninety-nine with
no in-app purchases more time war band
skirmish is a turn-based strategy game
you'll control one of three mercenary
factions and do battle with the other
two you'll be able to recruit characters
for your war band and also train them up
to be more powerful additionally the
game will include more factions as DLC
in later updates it's a tough game maybe
a little too tough for some players and
it also has a few bugs here and there
the developers seem to be cleaning it up
as best as they can the game is
otherwise free to download with in-app
purchases pokemon magic herb jump is
probably the most casual pokemon game
yet your goal is to train your Magikarp
to jump higher than all of the other
magic carps other Pokemon will make
cameos while you're training and
additionally you'll have to go through
multiple generations of Magikarp to make
yours truly great it'll also feature
some decorations for your little pond
area it's good for killing a few minutes
however that's about all it's good for
it's a freemium game so you can download
it for free slay away camp is another
casual game however it is absolutely
nothing like Magikarp jump this one has
you playing the role of a person killing
lots of other people the graphics take a
lot of the impact of just how gory this
game is it features a hundred and forty
levels various obstacles to overcome and
tons and tons of death scenes the
developers are bringing more in future
updates and that includes more levels
Google Play game support and a
lotmore thankfully they squashed any
serious bugs before release and you can
pick up this gem for $2.99 with no
in-app purchases zombie gunship survival

successful zombie shooters in mobile
gaming this one brings a lot of the same
mechanics back from the first one you'll
spend most of your time floating in an
aircraft blowing zombies away the goal
is to protect your base and allied
soldiers from the zombie horde you'll
also be able to build up your base and
deploy troops to help out it'll be one
of the better casual shooters released
