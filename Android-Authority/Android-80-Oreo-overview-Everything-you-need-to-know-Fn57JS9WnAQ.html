handy from Android Authority comm and
Google has finally unveiled Android Oreo
to the masses and released the first
factory images we've been playing with
developer previews for months but now we
get to play with the final draft here is
Android Oreo let's start with the UI
changes first the main interface hasn't
changed all that much everything is
still material designed the theme is
still similar and moving around the UI
is pretty much exactly the same as
Android nougats the app drawer is still
there the settings menu is still in its
usual spots and the quick settings work
pretty much the same way those familiar
but the system won't have any trouble
getting around there are some changes
though the largest and most noticeable
is the settings menu many of the
settings have been renamed moved around
and consolidated in an attempt to make
things a little bit easier for instance
connected devices is now a single item
in the settings menu and the slide-out
drawer is now gone as well in addition
many of the settings menu sub menus have
been redesigned for instance the apps
and notification settings have been
vastly simplified as has the display
settings
most of the stuff can now be seen in one
sub menu instead of several and Google
did particularly well at making the
settings feel less intimidating and we
like that a lot
there are also some small UI changes
including a slight font change a slight
design change on the lockscreen and
changes in the notifications several
applications have new icons and the
status bar is slightly altered these are
all excessively minor but we thought
we'd mentioned them anyway the small
tweaks continue with the media
notifications they will now change color
based on the thing that you're listening
to here you can see the Grateful Dead's
artwork is brown so the notification is
also brown whereas Pink Floyd's pulse
artwork is black and blue and thus the
notification is black and blue it's not
overly important but it's kind of nice
there are some other small tweaks here
and there the quick settings is now a
light gray color it makes the UI look a
little bit cleaner and meshes slightly
better with the colors of the settings
menu notifications and the Google screen
in addition these settings menu icon
quick settings edit button and the
profile button now rests at the bottom
of the click settings instead of at the
top it's a small change you might like
it you might not it's really not that
big of a deal
speaking of things that people are
getting upset about
how about all of those new emoji gone
are the popular blob designs in favor of
more colorful rounder designs a lot of
people are upset about how they look
others seem to enjoy the new design and
considering how subjective something
like this is it can go either way
the last big change is adaptive icons
this is a customization feature that
allows you to change the shape of all of
your icons there are currently five
options and we imagine that more are
coming soon enough
we're also relatively certain that this
is only for the pixel launcher right now
Android Oreo received plenty of new
features with the latest update and
perhaps the biggest and most noticeable
one is the picture-in-picture mode
this puts whatever video you're watching
into a little window that you can move
around the screen this frees you up to
do something else in a separate app it's
a niche multitasking feature but it's
now available on all Android devices and
not just Android TV notification dots
and badges were other big features in
Android Oreo you've seen notification
badges before on OAM versions of Android
along with iOS and now Android has
officially caught up notification dots
are also pretty fun you can long press
on app icons to see the notifications
specifically for that app along with
some other options you can also snooze
notifications if you don't want to deal
with them until later
speaking of notifications Android Oreo
now has notification channels these
allow you to let only some types of
notifications and while ignoring some
others for instance in Google all√¥ you
can leave it on four messages but turn
it off for new feature notifications
Google Chrome also has them enabled for
each website that you allow
notifications for and you can ignore
them as you so choose it's an excellent
customization feature moving right along
another new feature is called smart text
selection Android will now try to
determine the context of any text that
you highlight if it's an address you'll
have the option to open Google Maps or
if it's a phone number you'll be given
the option to call it directly unknown
entries will get a general web search
option we're sure this is going to be
expanded eventually and it could be
pretty fun
Android Oreo has also revamped
installing apks from unknown sources
from now on you'll give individual
applications permissions to download
apks the system will remember where you
got the APK and it will only allow its
installation if it was downloaded from a
trusted app it's fairly convoluted and
difficult to explain but you'll
eventually get used to it
the biggest features in Android Oh are
under the foot there are tons of things
that you can't see but it's there and it
wasn't before
there are the usual array of performance
improvements and bug fixes from nougat
but it doesn't stop there
Android Oreo now supports wide color
gamut for apps that is essentially geek
speek for HDR some devices and apps have
this already but it's easier to
implement it on android oreo keep in
mind that your device display has to
also support it
you can't magically make your screen
show more colors it's a new feature not
magic there are also a bunch of new
Bluetooth codecs and Android Oreo and
this will be one of the more
underappreciated features the new codecs
include AAC app decks apps X HD and
Sony's L DAC that means that Android
will be natively compatible with the
highest end bluetooth headphones out
there considering how many OMS are
removing the headphone jack and pushing
bluetooth use this update makes a lot of
sense and we're really happy that they
did it Google has also reoptimize how
background tasks operates they will have
less freedom to operate in the
background than they had before
applications will have windows of time
to perform actions while the phone is
idle that should dramatically help
reduce battery drain while the phone
screen isn't actively in use that's all
part of a system called vitals that will
optimize apps optimize Android improve
battery and a whole bunch of other stuff
it's great news for people who use a lot
of social media apps or other types of
applications that like to run in the
background all damn day for no damn
reason draining all of your battery life
and doing whatever they want that ends
with Android Oreo or at least we really
hope so finally Google Play protect
rolled out just before the official
launch of Android Oreo this one isn't an
Android Oreo specific feature many
devices will have it and you can find
evidence of this existence in the Google
Play Store and parts of the settings
menu you can see additional info in the
security section of the settings in this
final segment we will talk about all of
the fun things that as developers can do
now that you'll see eventually we
discussed a few of them in the
notification channels with the
notification dots and all of that stuff
but that is just the tip of the iceberg
the big one that everyone's talking
about is the new autofill API this will
give password managers and other
applications better access to login
boxes and other input fields in order to
automatically fill them with information
that includes Google Chrome for those
who use Chrome as a password manager and
for manager apps in general are going to
work a lot better with Android Oreo
another interesting one is called Wi-Fi
aware this allows Android Oreo devices
to communicate with each other without
actually being connected to a similar
network which could be pretty useful in
public we'll have to wait until some
developers use this in their
applications in order to check it out
most of the new API is fall into three
categories it's either an entirely new
API that adds new features to apps a new
API to help developers play with the
newly supported hardware or API
improvements to make old stuff much
easier we've outlined most of the
biggest new API is like picture and
picture auto fill notification channels
etc a lot of these features will have to
be added into apps by developers before
they'll work properly a few of the
hardware additions include better
support for hardware keyboards and mice
that includes navigation hotkeys for
moving around apps that are designed for
touchscreens and this is especially
important for Chromebooks that now
support Android apps in addition Android
or EO will now have better support for
multiple displays computer mice and a
whole lot more most of the new stuff
though is really just making old stuff a
lot easier Google has provided api's to
make text size easier to code adjust
margins and padding along with things
like enhancements to media players web
view animations media recording and a
lot more this is definitely going to
help small teams of developers and
independent developers code better apps
the list is actually fairly extensive
and this video would be twice if not
three times as long if I went through
each one individually we have a link to
Google's developer website that will
give you more details on the smaller
stuff Android o is a pretty extensive
update it actually feels like a larger
update coming to this from Android
nougat than it was going to Android
nougat from Android marshmallow there is
a lot of framework being put in place
here that should provide a lot of fun
stuff in the coming years we especially
like the new notification features the
Bluetooth codec support the new adaptive
icons and the support for all of the new
hardware there seem to be a heavier
emphasis than usual on cleaning out the
junk and smoothing out the rough edges
the quick settings colors put it more in
line with the rest of the UI the
background task management has been
shored up in tightened Google Play
protect helps with app security and all
of that other stuff there really isn't
one feature or thing that stands out in
particular but Android Oreo feels more
cohesive than older version
of Android it wasn't all puppy dogs and
fairytales though a lot of people don't
like the new emoji and there really
wasn't a hallmark feature this year like
multi-window last year or doze mode and
marshmallow afterall picture-in-picture
mode was in nougat as an Android TV
feature so even it's not actually new
additionally not all of these features
are going to work on all phones for
instance app decks and apps xhd won't
officially be included on the Nexus 5x
or the Nexus 6p it's not a bad update by
any stretch of the imagination but it
also wasn't that big thankfully most of
the new features and background stuff
should make it on most devices that
managed to make it to Android Oreo also
since I know you're going to ask we have
no idea when your phone is getting
Android Oreo yet we will be covering a
lot of the features we just talked about
an Android Oreo more in depth over the
coming weeks and writing about wind
phones will be getting their Android
Oriol update as we find out in either
case you're going to want to keep it
tuned to Android authority to find out
even more and that about does it for
this one folks don't forget to subscribe
to android authority and bring the bell
to get even more Android videos as soon
as we release them don't forget to share
this if you liked it and check out the
links in the video description below for
more details as always thanks for
watching everybody and have a wonderful
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
