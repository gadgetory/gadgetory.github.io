but it seems like somebody finally
figured it out why not just put phone
bits in a tablet is this a phone on
steroids or a tablet with an identity
crisis
well the answer is yes
hey it's Joshua Carver manager authority
what's going on everybody and this is
the Asus fonepad if the phone pad looks
familiar
remember that Asus brought you the great
Google Nexus 7 and the phone pad is
actually very similar you get a 7-inch
screen device with the sizable bezel
around the display with the front facing
camera and phone speaker grille up top
the back sports a nice brushed aluminum
finish which gives it a nice industrious
look and feel up top you get the rear
camera with a great addition of a small
removable cover that allows access to
the sim and SD card slots you get three
buttons on the left for power and volume
all in all it handles just like the
Nexus 7 and is very similar to most
other 7-inch offerings this does help
for taking phone calls but the phone pad
is otherwise supposed to be treated like
any other tablet with both hands much of
the phone pad will not blow you away
with super high-end specs and this
starts with the display despite being at
7 inches this IPS LCD screen is capable
of a 1280 by 800 resolution at 216 PPI
it definitely isn't as powerful as even
most 5-inch devices these days but it is
still a good performer you get a good
color reproduction so that images and
videos have a good level of vibrancy and
though the pixel density may not be very
high the experience is still quite good
at an average distance away get any
closer though and you will start to see
the pixel separation now you do get
settings to change some aspects of the
display in an app called a soos splendid
so there is a way to get it to just
where you want it among the multitudes
of Qualcomm Snapdragon processors out
there you get something different with a
single core Intel Atom zito 420 clocked
in at 1.2 gigahertz now it isn't as
powerful as high-end chips we see these
days but it does get the job done and to
to benchmark locks it in at around at
the 7500 mark but you do get smoothness
across the device there are occasional
hiccups that occur from time to time and
they seem to happen mostly in intensive
games and apps
speaking of games the power VR SGX 540
is the included graphics chip it did
have a little bit of trouble with into
the dead and even stuttered a bit during
candy crush you may find more of these
hiccups running too many apps at once as
the foam pad comes with 1 gigabyte of
RAM ultimately it is a very capable
performer though it did not Wow and
requires a little patience in those more
intensive experiences as far as hardware
goes you do get either 8 or 16 gigabytes
of storage expandable by a SD card slot
otherwise the usual bevy of connections
are available GPS Wi-Fi bluetooth though
NFC is absent now the speaker might be
relegated to just the one grille on the
lower back but the general quality is
actually pretty good despite lacking in
some volume an audio wizard AB does
cater the sound to different types and
does well to enhance the sound
accordingly but the biggest story here
obviously is the phone side underneath
the cover you can pop in your GSM SIM
card and use this tablet just like any
of your phones mobile data is possible
via HSDPA connectivity and all phone and
SMS related apps are concluded the phone
pad truly treats itself like an
oversized phone but is very unassuming
about it if you didn't know any better
you think this is just another 7-inch
tablet the call and texting capabilities
are just like any phone and the phone
speaker is adequately loud and clear
otherwise it really wasn't anything
overly special other than being an
oversized phone holding the phone pad up
to your face for the call definitely
take some getting used to and even now
I'm still not sure if I am but if there
is one part of the phone pad that excels
it is the battery life a hefty 40 to 70
milliamp hour battery powers the tablet
for nine hours of talktime in my time
with it regular usage stretched out over
10 hours which is really impressive and
with the great standby time you might be
able to go up to two whole days of
regular use before actually needing a
charged power saving options will help
you get even more out of the phone pad
it probably is the longest lasting phone
I've ever used but of course the size of
the tablet and the battery inside are
obvious reasons why the camera is
perhaps the most underwhelming part of
the phone
three megapixels or all you get in the
rear camera and the picture quality
definitely doesn't compare to most
smartphone cameras even under indoor
lighting white color still got washed
out there was a fair level of grain
throughout and details were definitely
not captured adequately daylight shots
fared better but are still below average
quality like some cameras we have seen
on tablets it is more of an add-on
rather than a real selling point and
finally we get to the software jellybean
4.1.2 powers this Asus modified you I
escaped things looking mostly stock
aside from additions like a pair of
widgets and a suite of floating
applications very similar to Sony small
apps with these you can make a floating
to-do list or even watch a video while
multitasking Susa did add in apps for
customization like studio a photo editor
storybook which make small memory
presentations using pictures and videos
and a couple nice memo apps with some
customization added in a soos keeps
things simple and easy to use by not
doing too much or even too little now
though the phone side might be a nifty
change in the tablet game it's become
clear that the phone pad isn't really
going to overthrow any of the top
players in the game luckily it is priced
accordingly at around 249 US dollars and
just under 200 euros for the European
market and so there you have it what I
recommend the phone pad it's not for
everyone that's for sure this is because
most people probably already have a
capable smartphone and unless you are
okay with swapping the SIM card back and
forth between it and a Seuss's hybrid
tablet you'd have to shell out more for
an extra off-contract plan I actually
thought it was cool to use the phone pad
like any other tablet and then when a
call came in I could just answer it but
I also knew that as their singular
device most people might find it
cumbersome and even maybe just a little
bit weird if you aren't one of those
people though the phone pad just might
fulfill a need you've been waiting for
and in the end the Asus fonepad is less
of a great oversized phone and more like
a very nice 3g tablet that happens to be
capable of making and taking calls
