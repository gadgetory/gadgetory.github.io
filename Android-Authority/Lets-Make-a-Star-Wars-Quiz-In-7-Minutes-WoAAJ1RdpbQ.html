learning-by-doing isn't such a good idea
abseiling lion-taming flying a plane
these are scenarios where it's better to
really know your theory before you jump
in but in coding or development getting
started on projects is often the best
way to really understand all that fear
me to sit in context and how it all
works that's what makes all the
difference so whilst it's a good idea to
do some background reading as soon as
possible you should start trying to put
that theory into practice and come up
with some kind of beginner project and I
think a great beginner project is to
create some kind of quiz because a quiz
is a simple project that you can make
easily it's something rewarding you can
play on your own or with friends and
something you can change and develop and
turn into all kinds of other things in
this video I'm going to show you how to
make a Star Wars quiz because everyone's
in a stall with mood right now
but you could easily turn this into any
other kind of quiz or you could turn it
into some kind of brain training program
or a maths game or an app that shows you
information so follow along and
hopefully you'll learn something
hopefully you'll enjoy the project and
read the accompanying article to get a
better understanding of what everything
does so this project is aimed at
beginners yes but beginners with a
little bit of background understanding
regarding Java regarding XML and Android
if you have no prior experience you can
still play along but I highly recommend
you do some reading in order to
understand some of the things that I'm
going to skim over I will explain a bit
but for a much better understanding
follow the link in the description or
just do your own background reading the
whole thing is going to take seven
minutes because that's what I do and if
you get stuck of course just use the
force okay so in most new apps you're
going to have an activity and activity
being a page or a screen in your app and
this will be made up of a Java file in
this case mainactivity.java and a layout
file in this case activity underscore
main dot XML and the great thing is that
if we use the design view by making sure
you're on the design tab down the bottom
here that's the text tab then you can
simply drag and drop the different
elements you want to onto the screen and
if you select a view then on the right
here you can change the attributes in
the attribute window you can also change
the name of a view
by changing the ID and this will allow
us to refer to it later we're going to
call this one question now if you want
to add another textview we simply drag
and drop from here like so and we're
actually going to have four more so
we're going to name these answer one
answer two and answer three always a
good idea and that will be called
outcome that bottom one you need to
anchor all four sides to either the edge
of the display or another view that's
anchored and that's nice and easy we are
going to add one more thing though and
that's an on click for these so we want
to click view all attributes in our
attribute window here and we'll call
this on answer one click what this is
going to do is allow us to refer to what
happens when someone clicks on this in
our code can you guess what this one on
the called on answer to click and on
answer three click okay so there's lots
of different ways we could approach
making a quiz but I think we should use
a map and seeing as I'm kind of in
charge that's probably what we're gonna
be doing so okay so with that in mind we
need to create our map and we do that
like say so we're saying a map with two
strings that's the key in the value
we're gonna call our map questions I'm
gonna say new hash map string string
brackets now you'll notice these are red
if you find things red like this just
click on them and press alt + enter that
imports a new class I won't go into what
that means okay next we're going to
create a new integer which is a whole
number I'm gonna call that question no
and as you can probably guess that's
going to refer to which question we're
on and the next thing we need to do is
create our views text view outcome text
view question text view answer 1 ok next
we need to tell our code that those
views are the ones who defined earlier
in the XML and do that by saying find
view by ID our meaning resource
answer one remember we used capitals
there let me can do the same thing for
answer two and answer three I'm also
gonna want to do the same thing for the
question we're gonna want to do the same
thing for our out to come okay now we're
going to need to populate our map that
means putting in our questions and
answers and we do that by saying
questions remember that's what we called
the map put and then we can say question
one that's the key and then the value
might be what is kylo ren's real name
there so I made earlier you can steal
mine from the article on the site or
writing your own notice that I've got
write one wrong a one wrong b1 so we're
using this number and we need to be
consistent with the naming conventions
here and you're gonna see why in a
moment okay so now we're going to create
a new method set question so that's read
for now because that's not actually a
normal command I'm going to say private
void which means that it's a method that
doesn't need to be accessed by other
parts of the program so to assign those
questions and answers to our views we go
like so question set text which is a way
of changing the text questions get so
questions remember is our map and then
we need to use our key to retrieve that
we're going to get that with question
and then plus question now so that's
going to change as the question goes up
and then we need to do the same thing of
course for the answers I'm gonna do one
more thing here as well and that's to
set a tag for answer one and that's
going to be correct okay the next thing
I want to do is to create another method
this won't be a public method because
we're using it from outside this script
and it's called on answer one click and
it has view V there as well and here
we're just going to say if answer one
get tagged
is equal to correct then we execute this
bit of script which is to say on our
outcome set text well done and then
we're going to reset our questions but
only after we've iterated the question
number so now it's moved on to question
two or three and then we're going to say
accept question again otherwise else
outcome set text try again to our view
which just means whichever view happens
to have been clicked and the reason for
that is because it makes it much easier
for us just copy and paste this and put
in our announcer to click and on answer
three click again there are quicker and
better ways of doing this we could for
instance have a global on click and then
look for that tag and that's really the
reason to be doing that however I'm
keeping things simple here just so you
can follow along and this is the easiest
way to do it okay so all that's really
left to do now is to change the order so
that it's not always the same and for
that we're going to need a random number
you'll need to import that class by the
way and we get that by writing this dot
next int three
there we go and then we can say if the
value one equals zero so that's going to
have a value of zero to two because it
starts at zero three options starting at
zero in quantal equals there okay and
then we can say else if the value 1
equals 1 then we put our correct answer
and our tag in the second position and
else if the value 1 equals 2 then the
correct answer and tag go in the third
position it doesn't really matter where
the wrong answers are and there you go
and of course again there are better
ways of doing this what I would actually
do is enter that data into a list and
then shuffle the list using a good
random algorithm but again for
simplicity sake this will work just fine
and there you have a complete working
quiz in just seven minutes today it Reds
at the bottom now well done and you hope
there's more to do obviously at the
moment we'll crash when you get to the
end of the list so you need to do
something about that and of course we
want to make it look nicer and you'll do
that in the XML and you can change the
background and I set a Star Wars logo at
the top you can do that by just using an
image view for instance and you can mess
around with your colors by going to the
values and go to the colors XML change
the scheme mess around with it as you
like well that's the basic bones the
bare bones of your quiz and of course it
can change the questions and the topic
to be anything you like but if you make
a horticultural quiz that you can
probably assume you're going to have
fewer people wanting to play so you
found this video useful interesting guys
if you did then please leave a like
please share it around and let me know
in the comments what you thought if it
gets stuck or if you have any requests
for future videos of course stay tuned
