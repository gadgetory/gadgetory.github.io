Authority in here MWC 2017 Opel revealed
their 5x dual camera zoom technology and
it's actually a pretty incredible piece
of engineering that Oppo spent almost an
entire year working on just as a quick
disclaimer these phones here on the show
floor are purely prototypes so they're
not phones that are coming to market and
are here solely just for showcasing the
5x zoom so here's how it works just like
many smartphone cameras that we've seen
on the market lately opos 5x zoom
technology uses 2 cameras you have one
wide-angle lens and a second telephoto
lens and the telephoto lens is
essentially where the magic happens the
telephoto lens sits sideways inside the
camera module and this is what allows it
to have the space for a much deeper zoom
and there's also a prism inside to
direct light hitting the camera right
into the lens because of this periscope
style structure it also allows open to
keep the camera module thin coming into
only 5.7 millimeters which means you
won't get any unsightly camera bulge
when we finally see this technology on a
full production phone and oppa says that
it's ten percent thinner than other
camera modules that only offer two X
optical zoom
so with this dual lens setup you can
zoom up to 5x without need loss in
quality and anything beyond that will
obviously result in some deterioration
but I was pretty surprised that you
still pull out a good amount of detail
even when fully zoomed in at 10x
something that typically happens when
you zoom in is that it usually becomes
much more difficult to keep the camera
stable but Opel has built optical image
stabilization directly into the
telephoto lens and the prism itself
allowing the lens to compensate for
vibrations in real time and according to
Oppo this new OES technology offers a
40% improvement over previous
generations now the big question is
whether we'll see this technology come
to the state especially since OBO
doesn't necessarily have a huge presence
in the US but regardless this is a huge
breakthrough for smartphone camera tech
and I'm very excited to see this
technology and the smart phone very soon
whether it's through Opel themselves or
if it's something they could possibly
license to other manufacturers that
would be pretty awesome to see but what
do you guys think about opus 5x zoom
technology let us know down in the
comments below and as always if you
