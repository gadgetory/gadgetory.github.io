that allows you to install rom like
features without installing a rom at all
this tool is considered a must-have for
power users now there's plenty of
tutorials online and how to get
installed and how to set it up but
there's not many videos out there as far
as where the top modules well today
you're in luck because I Kevin the tech
major is going to tell you the top
modules for exposed framework in no
particular order these are the top
xposed framework modules leading off the
list we have activity force new tasks
now one of the main annoyances with
android is if you're in an application
like Google+ and you click on a YouTube
video it launches YouTube and plays the
video but once you press the back arrow
it actually takes you back to your
launcher and not back to Google+ this
module fixes the issue this forces your
system to create a new task when an
application is launched you can also pop
over into options and set filters for
different applications as well the next
module is one of those modules that is a
must-have for many users including
myself
this is blacklist this lets you block
certain people from calling you or
texting you you can set up filters and
exception lists as well
you have different profiles and a
limited amounts of customization you can
easily go into recent and quickly add
someone to your list as well and from my
experience it works very very
effectively I mean you can block an SMS
so you can block a call and it works
every time have you ever wondered why
some applications or games are always
open no matter what you do I mean you
can just reboot your device in two
seconds later these applications or
games are running in the background for
some arbitrary reason well you can fix
that with boot manager this simple tool
lets you disable apps from starting up
with your device you simply click on the
apps that you don't want to load when
Android boots up its a minimalistic
approach to help clean things up
Android gives us a lot of options and we
have a lot of options a big con is that
sometimes it can slow down your workflow
and one of the workflows I'm talking
about is the Share Option with complete
action plus you can modify the share
option and you can customize the default
applications window for example you can
remove applications that you never use
from the list and also you can put stars
next applications that you do want to
use more so move them to the top of the
list you can change the size and modify
the colors there are dozens of options
and configurations you can choose from
so install it and try it out for the
people out there that want to grab as
much as they can out of their battery
you can then install a DS battery saver
and make this your new best friend
this application lets you select from a
list of battery profiles you can
optimize your battery and it gives you
recommendations to save battery life if
you're envious of the galaxy s5 in the
battery saver mode don't be because you
can do pretty much the same thing in
this application overall this is a
simple but yet powerful tool that can
easily net you a few hours on your
battery
I know security is very important when
it comes to your device you'd like to
have a password or a pen or even your
face to unlock your phone but what about
your apps this module is called
protected apps with protected apps you
can use a system password to protect
certain applications this is a system
level lock so there's really no way to
get around it once you launch the
application you didn't have to put in
your system password to unlock it you
can also dig into the settings and
really customize how often it asks for
that password this is a tiny add-on but
it adds so much visual awesomeness to
your device this is smooth progress bars
this does what it says it makes your
progress bars smooth as butter
this lets you tweak and adjust the
loading bars this is a small visual
tweak but once you have it installed
it's something you can't live without
and then it really makes you wonder why
the Android progress bars are not as
smooth
this one is for non KitKat users or if
you have a om skin on your phone this
makes your status bar translucent and
it's nicely named tinted translucent
status bars and what I really like about
it is that it does the work for you it
has a built-in database that downloads
the color profiles for you and what it
does it it makes your status bar the
same color as the application just a
visual tweak to make things look a whole
lot better if you want further
modification of your status bar or other
UI elements then look at wanna this lets
you dig into the visual elements on your
screen and then you can modify and make
changes nothing groundbreaking but just
enough to make your device your own once
you open the module you go in there you
can pretty much click around and play
with all the settings to come up with
something you like you can then even
save it as a preset or you can go back
to the way it was this works best with
AOSP roms and is also a TouchWiz version
too I didn't forget about your security
nuts out there X privacy is the way to
go for security X privacy is a featured
rich security application and allows you
to have total protection of your
information
you decide which applications have
access to your information at all times
so I can tell Facebook that I don't want
to have access to my location
I can even spoof a location now this is
great especially for games that want to
have access to your contact list for
some reason please water my farm and
there you have it guys that was my top
10 xposed framework modules as always if
I had something in the list that you
never heard of and you tried it on you
liked it go ahead and let me know down
below and press the thumbs up while
you're at it and also if you have a
module that did make the list this time
around go ahead and leave it down below
too so I can check that out for the next
video as always guys my name is Kevin
