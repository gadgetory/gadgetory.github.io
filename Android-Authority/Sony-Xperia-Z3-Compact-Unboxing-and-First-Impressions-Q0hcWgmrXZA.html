Sony Xperia z3 compact now you can kind
of argue that this might have been a bit
more anticipated in terms of its release
because while every half you do we
expect to get an experience the updates
we didn't get one half a year ago with
the z2 compact for example we're
skipping hit to z3 but I already took
the stickers off here and we're going to
go ahead and just jump into the box
itself so I'll just go ahead and jump
over and there it is this is a very
small device when compared to a lot of
the behemoths that are coming out right
now but it still packs all the power
underneath and that's what we really
liked about the z1 compact and we
believe we're going to continue that
with this version a screen protector is
already available here it's nice that
Sony always adds these in along with
their releases inside the box and take
out this flap and we're going to find
some extra bits and pieces inside we do
have the microUSB charging cable along
with the port or rather adapter the plug
adaptor that is made for European plugs
in this case and some manuals over here
on the side now here's an interesting
development as I can already see I took
a look at the box and saw that it came
with a particular stereo headset and
that is exactly what we're seeing right
here when you look at the Xperia z3
unboxing you'll see that the headphones
that came with it were actually well
kind of subpar they were really just
sort of the kinds that you would expect
to find in kind of lower end releases
but in this particular compact release
it looks like we have a much higher
quality type of headphone so it's a bit
of an interesting development but at
least with the compact you're going to
be getting a better audio experience at
least with the headphones that come with
the phone itself and that right there is
a look at the contents of the Xperia z3
compact box alright let's go ahead and
get this bad boy out of the plastic and
peel the plastic off the front and back
and start with the back end here
just go ahead and get
that off the glass panels always look
awesome when you get the plastic off of
a Sony device coming around to the sides
we have a nice sleek feel just slightly
round it off not quite as much as the
Xperia z3 but certainly an upgrade from
the z1 compact since we're talking about
the compact a-line that Sony puts out
and now time for the plastic off the
front looks beautiful alright so we have
the signature power button over here on
the side even a dedicated camera button
which is always a nice addition and then
on the other side we have the ports that
are covered by this cover right here
that you can actually access from this
top portion right here and that will
give you access to the micro USB
charging slot or port rather and the
micro SD card slot on the other side we
have the cover for the nano SIM as
everything seems to be going Nano in
terms of SIM cards these days so you
have those over on the side and of
course we're going to turn on the phone
and see what we have underneath the
surface now we have the Xperia U i right
here which is very familiar
after all it does take on a lot of the
tropes of the stock Android builds out
there keeps things pretty simple but
also keeps it quite fast you have the
hope and then that little drawer over on
the left side comes out in order for you
to customize the app drawer you can do
that by sliding over and normally I'd
like to go straight to alphabetical and
we have that with the notification drop
down some quick settings over here on
the other side but other than that it's
a pretty standard affair especially
considering the Xperia UI which usually
keeps things pretty simplistic and
pretty minimal not too robust at all
especially not too daunting in terms of
its feature set now you've probably
heard me say on multiple occasions that
smaller devices like the compact here
that comes in at a screen that is below
5 inches is really a refreshing
experience we have a lot of really large
displays out there these days and really
being able to just maneuver around this
device is always going to be a nice
experience something that really kind of
reminds you that we don't need the
biggest screens in order to have a good
time when it comes
Android and in our smartphone
experiences in general already I was
taking some pictures of this phone and I
was able to just maneuver around this
device with no issues at all just sort
of shuffled it around in my fingers and
really I have no fear of dropping this
particular phone right here we have the
button layout on the side already as I
was taking pictures of that and really
it's just easy that's what really the
smaller form factors remind you of is
that sometimes you just need an
experience to be easy especially when it
comes to the handling well we do have
this phone here ready for you and we're
going to be putting it through its paces
as well I do have the Xperia z3 review
coming up quite soon so make sure you
stay tuned for that but we will also
take a look at this and compare the two
and see which one might be in a better
experience for you considering we still
have all the power underneath with a
high-powered processor and even the same
20 point seven megapixel camera over
here on the rear so keep it tuned to
your to Android 30 for that and the
future coverage of the Sony Xperia z3
compact we also have the tablet coming
in at some point but for now we're going
to focus on the z3 and the z3 compact
which some argue might be the real story
here when it comes to Sony's releases at
this part of 2014 so keep it tuned to
your drop of some mics in our videos and
remember to subscribe if you haven't
already when you're done with all of
that jump on over to android authority
