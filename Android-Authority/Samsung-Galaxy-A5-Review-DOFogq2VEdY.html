name is Kevin the tech ninja today I'm
reviewing the galaxy a5 now guys that
live stateside I know what you're
thinking I don't care this phone is not
coming over here but let's think about
something for a second the galaxy s6 is
just around the corner and Samsung has
been known to try out new things on
their other devices so the way that this
is made using aluminum versus plastic
and also the way TouchWiz is running on
the system make sure you check out the
review anyways so you can see what the
s6 may have in store for you I'm Kevin
the tech ninja welcome to my dojo it
seems that the number one complaint
about Samsung's design is their use of
plastic Samsung's Galaxy line was
created to be the flagship device to
have but for some the use of plastic
made it feel well
pretty cheap enter the galaxy a5 light
sleek and aluminum the moment you put it
in your hand you instantly get that feel
of premium that Samsung has been
searching for all those mostly aluminum
the a5 is really light only weighs four
point three four ounces on the front
you'll find the classic Samsung layout
with front facing camera and LEDs on the
top speaker grille at the bottom chin
the back and multitasking capacitive
buttons are flanking the home button
Samsung likes this layout and they're
sticking with their guns on this one on
the back you have the 13 megapixel
shooter which is located towards the
middle and the camera is accompanied by
the LED flash and also the speaker
grille the speaker grille is in an
awkward location it often gets covered
up when honing your device and landscape
this location also makes the sound lack
depth and sense of direction speaker
calls sound fine but when listening to
music or gaming that's when you can
really hear the disadvantages of only
having one speaker in that location a
great example is when listening to music
that uses left and right channels
independently you are stuck hearing both
channels coming out the same spot which
can dramatically change the sound of a
song on the right bezel you have the
power button and also two SIM card slots
left side as the volume rocker and at
the bottom you see the charging port and
also
headphone jack the screen size is 5
inches which gives it a screen to body
ratio of 71 percent this super-mo
LED screens PPI is 294 the resolution is
720p colors pop off well with this
display with very high saturation levels
even if the color temperature is a bit
too vivid for you you can easily adjust
this in the display options within the
settings and what I mean by vivid is
that a lot of the colors has an
additional punch to it it's a color
style that Samsung has adopted and
matured over the years and is working
pretty well for them the engine that
makes this whole operation run is the
Snapdragon 410 it's a 64-bit quad-core
processor that runs at 1.2 gigahertz the
GPU pairing is the andrina 306 and 2
gigabytes of RAM it does have a micro SD
card slot that you can expand up to 64
gigabytes of 16 gigabytes onboard isn't
enough for you and as I mentioned before
it does have dual SIM card slots so for
people that travel internationally often
this is a huge bonus for them and get
used to these specs most mid-level
devices will be running this chipset in
the foreseeable future the hardware
isn't going to shake up the world but
it's a decent mid-level offering from
Samsung the Snapdragon 410 absolutely
flies opening and closing applications
is done effortlessly and as far as the
UI is concerned is comparable to the
Snapdragon 805 in 2015 handling the UI
is a pretty simple task for these phones
to do so it isn't really a big surprise
I know a lot of people like to mention
the TouchWiz lag but on this device I'm
not seeing it TouchWiz appears to be
more watered-down and not so much in
your face but more on this in the
software section when it comes to gaming
the 410 and adrenal 306 combines to give
you a decent gaming device most games
run with little lag even switching
between games and back to your home
screen is quick the phone's performance
is just solid the 64-bit architecture is
here and it's running well but we won't
see 64-bit really shine until we see the
phones with 4 gigabytes of RAM
for the full benchmark scores make sure
you check out the written companion
paste link down below out of the box
that is running 4.4.4 kitkat and as you
know it's running TouchWiz which is a
highly modified skin on top of Android
for better or worse TouchWiz is most
people's introduction into Android and
it does a great job at getting you
acclimated
but for purists like me or maybe you you
rather have a more vanilla version of
Android or at least an option to switch
from TouchWiz to that the home screen by
default has three screens you can swipe
left and it takes you to Flipboard you
can also swipe right that takes you to
your other page or you can press and
hold for more home screen functions like
widgets icons and settings shockingly
enough there was no blow wordless device
at all I mean you'll find a few Samsung
applications onboard like my files
Flipboard voice recorder and s planner
but I didn't see any other type of trial
software maybe because this isn't locked
down to a carrier a lot of times
carriers are the ones that actually add
to the bloat we're comparing this to the
s5 all the applications that are on this
device is running the same version
messages browsers my files all look and
behave the exact same way the headlines
as of late is that Samsung is trying to
make the s6 more like a stock version of
Android in my takeaway from this is that
Samsung is considering a slimmer
TouchWiz and providing their
applications a Lockhart and this is
something that I'm pretty excited about
for some people the camera on the phone
is one of the most important features to
have Samsung realizes that it provides
one of the best cameras on a smartphone
the a5 brings a 13 megapixel shooter to
the game it's extremely quick and
provides very clean images now for a
mobile device the depth of field on
these images are pretty good this gives
the subject the ability to stick out of
the background in good lighting images
appear bright and vivid with a lot of
life to them and lower lighting
scenarios images still come out pretty
good but there is a bit of grain to the
images and sometimes they lack color but
beyond that it's one of the better
low-light cameras on the software side
of things it has less features in the s5
there are only a few shooting modes
available on this device you can head
into the Samsung store and download more
shooting modes although there are only
two extra ones
in there the front-facing camera is 5
megapixels just like the s5 the images
lack detail and color it's due to the
size of the lens it does not let a lot
of light into the lens so that means the
software needs to compensate for that
also beautify mode is owned by default
which can make your skin look like a
rubber if you're not careful you can
also go to additional settings by
sliding out the menu from the right and
things that are in there like white
balance ISO settings voice-activated
pictures and even hand gestures which
makes taking selfies a whole lot easier
the camera lens on the back protrudes
out a little bit so that means the a5
does not sit flush on a surface
thankfully it does not rock it's well
balanced so that's pretty good although
this camera is only 13 megapixels it
feels just like the s5 16 megapixels
just with less shooting modes images are
on par with each other and a shutter
speed is just as fast my parting shots
with this device is pretty simple
it's another good Samsung device its
mid-range but it's running the newer
Snapdragon 410 64-bit processor it's a
watered down version of TouchWiz from
the past so the device is pretty quick
and it comes with tons of free space
camera takes quick shots and for the
most part the images are pretty good if
you don't need top-end specs and a high
resolution screen and if the price is
right you should really consider this
phone and there you have it guys that
was the review for my galaxy a5 now

detail than I can in just a small video
