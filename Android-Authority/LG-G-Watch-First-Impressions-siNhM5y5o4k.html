the initial set up that I did for the
LGG watch when we unboxed it earlier
this morning and now that Google i/o
2014 is starting to come to a close I
thought I would just give you my
experience my first impressions pretty
much of the LGG watch now that I've used
it for maybe around six to eight hours
and I I got to tell you I really do like
it a lot now I will give you this
disclaimer that it's obvious that
Android wear is and it's real in almost
infancy really because it's going to be
coming out very soon for the general
markets the beta or the testing phase
that I am a part of right now will be
finishing into the next few days with
the final release and a lot of other
applications being released around July
7th so a lot of great applications are
going to come out at that point that
will add to the functionality but as far
as what I was able to do today I did
think a lot of it was really good and
there are some holes in the
functionality that I'm used to and other
smartwatches like say the pebble but I
think for the most part it does a great
job in is a wonderful jumping-off point
essentially when it comes to just the
design itself the silicon band is really
comfortable and I really don't have any
problems with it
I do see that the it will be able to
take some splashes I was like washing my
hands in the washroom earlier and they
really didn't do any anything to the
band or anything like that it's easy to
clean as a result it is water-resistant
and it will be able to withstand
whatever you take you you throw at it
you'll be able to wear this in the
shower for example and be able to
control your phone or your music or
whatnot from there as far as the touch
census sensitivity on the screen goes
you do seem to have to push a little bit
harder and you can't really have a
delicate touch which I will admit I have
from time to time with smartphones you
don't you need to have a little bit more
than a delicate touch when it comes to
the screen and it won't necessarily be
it's not it's not that's not responsive
it's just I've had maybe just one or two
instances where when I was swiping up
and down on the actual screen it wasn't
necessarily as responsive as I wanted it
to get sort of try again maybe one or
two more times
but that only happened a couple times
for the most part of the screen is
wonderfully responsive it is a bright
and vibrant screen it has it's able to
show all of the elements really well
especially with that material design you
have the card in front with that
background and it looks really wonderful
but as far as functionality goes I have
to give them a lot of credit because
when you swipe to the right or rather to
the left to get to the right of the card
you do find from time to time that
there's some extra functionality that
you didn't expect to be there and that's
that's really where my enjoyment with
this was the one that I will show you
right now is what was my favorite
example in which I had a hangouts
message from one of my best friends and
when I swiped over to see what I would
be able to do is that reply via hangouts
and when I clicked on that or pressed on
that I was able to dictate my response
and that was absolutely awesome I
thought that was great
earlier on I did lament that I wasn't
able to do more than just text people
but it looks like you're able to reply
to hangouts now you're not going to be
able to initiate a hangout
The Voice Recognition area but at the
very least you'll be able to reply as
they come along so if you reply swipe it
away dismiss it it comes back over reply
it keeps going like that that's
perfectly fine I would like there to be
more Google now voice commands that
we'll be able to perform some of the
some of the actions that I wish I would
be able to do like for example I know
that if you say ok Google that you play
music or say play some music it will
give you an I'm feeling lucky station
that will give you a lot of music based
upon your listening history and
unfortunately that doesn't it I work for
me
while I do listen to everything from
Michael Buble to Linkin Park from the
old days to hip hop to huge of s and to
even some EDM from time to time and I'm
getting into jazz unfortunately I listen
to hip-hop the most and I end up getting
a lot of that instead of what I really
want so I wish there was a way for me to
say something like play music play
playlist thumbs up just a thumbs up
players from google play music or play
play play list
Gambino or play playlist John Coltrane
you know I could I would be able to do
that and if I have a playlist that's
already set up then it would just play
that and I'll be able to do that if
anyone out there knows exactly that how
to do that in Google now if there's a
command that was it some saying that I'm
just not getting why I did a google
search and I didn't find it let me know
and I will shout I'll give you a
shout-out on the on the review but aside
from that the other functionality that I
feel like is missing is when you swipe
over from the music from the music card
swipe over to the left you have the next
Gradius that's fine and great but
there's no way for you to change the
volume of the music that's playing with
your phone and that's a functionality
that was already available on an elbow
which I'm coming from and it's something
that I feel like should be there but it
kind of is in and maybe an app of some
sort or maybe just some just another
card will be created for that I feel
like the onus area is on the Google now
team to create more functions more
commands and whatnot in order to make
the LGG watch even more robust than it
is already and I'm sure the developers
will be able to do that the final thing
that happened with me at least and my
first impression was I understand that
this is a somewhat beta version of this
device but navigation just didn't work
okay Google
navigate to Alamo Square
well would you look at that
well would you look at that alright well
I mean it's a good thing I did this
right after I was going to film just II
just the footage of me making it fail to
navigate to Alamo Square from here but
it looks like the update that I just
downloaded for maps literally the update
that came from the from this morning was
then updated again literally hours ago
and I was able to update it just now and
there you go navigation is actually
working on the LG G watch so I'm a very
happy man right now take back what I
said just a second ago in this video
that maps was not working and now it
looks like it is so here we are we have
a card 13 minutes of destination right
there you could exit navigation use the
app that is awesome and by the way to
the people who were worried that you
have way too many cards available and
have to swipe through for literally
everything that you want to look at that
is not the case trust me
unless you let you notifications get
completely out of hand you are not going
to have that much swiping to go through
only in one instance that I have that
problem and I had I did have a lot of
notifications not to swipe all the way
to the bottom to finally get to the
music player to hit play again for my
positive music that's the only time that
I had that issue but for the most part
if you just sort of swipe out if you
just miss all your notifications and
you're pretty good at that you're going
to keep everything really clean that's
not going to be a problem at all
so really that's just sort of my first
impressions on it as far as the design
again goes I do think it is a
comfortable design it does sit very
squarely on my wrist but the silicone
band is very very comfortable and really
I don't think that there's anything
wrong with the actual unit itself on my
wrist
all of these smartwatches are going to
be large bases that's are something
you're going to have to get used to at
least of this generation is this more
but all-in-all I do enjoy my time with
the OGG watch I look forward to using it
some more and I'll give you my full
review in a little while and really show
you especially after Android wear hips
it's full version I'm probably will have
to wait for my forward heel until after
these devices actually ship out and all
of the applications are in the Google
Play Store for everyone to use so keep
it tuned to Andra 34 all of that drop us
