alternatives to the galaxy s6 thanks to
Samsung's a series but here with the 5.2
inch galaxy a5 we might have the best
and most similar option hello everybody
its Crystal Laura and this is our review
of the Samsung Galaxy a5 now the reason
why I believe this could be the best
option for people who love to pick up a
galaxy s6 but can't justify its price is
due to the size of the a5 the a5 sports
only a 5.2 inch display which makes the
phone feel very similar to the s6 it's
quite a small package thanks to a small
bezels and you can really easily be
mistaken for a normal galaxy s6 although
we have this nice gold color here and of
course we have a beautiful Gorilla Glass
4 back panel here creating a beautiful
look and also feel in the hand now
that's the whole idea of Samsung's
a-series lineup give users a beautiful
premium design phone at a lower cost
as we'll see when we get to the specs
the phone has been bumped up in
thickness from the s6 and you can
definitely tell even though it's still
very thin the camera bump sinks into
housing a bit more and the phone has a
good amount of weight to it when it
comes to buttons speaker and charging
port placement is exactly the same as
you would expect with all Samsung phones
as of late now if you think the Galaxy
s6 is a nice looking phone you'll feel
the exact same way with a5 now we know
Samsung is known for displaying their
great Super AMOLED technology and the a5
definitely lives up to its name with is
very vibrant colors here we have a Super
AMOLED 5.2 inch display at 1080p with a
PPI of 424 and no it's not quite HD like
the s6 but of course this is a more
budget-friendly phone and with such a
small screen creating a PPI of 424 it's
more than enough this compact screen
size helps with one-handed use and the
resolution here makes text appear very
sharp of course on most AMOLED panels
whites may tend to lean towards pinkish
hues but here on the a5 not that much at
all and another downside with AMOLED
panels is their lack of brightness but
with a5 there are no issues at all
easily making for a great viewing
experience even under direct sunlight
overall 1080p on a 5.2 inch soup
on the display is fantastic and there is
nothing to complain about here when it
comes to the hardware you'll find
exactly what you're familiar with on any
Samsung phone as of late nothing has
been taken away and there's only one new
addition although it's a big one
microSD card expansion on the right side
we have a large dual SIM tray that
springs out allowing for either two nano
SIM cards or one nano SIM and a micro SD
card for up to 128 gigs of storage the
speaker is still placed on the bottom
right and it sounds pretty decent but is
facing away from the viewer and is easy
to cover up we have a physical home
button surrounded by the back and recent
app capacitive buttons but they are
reversed like on all Samsung phones as
expected the physical home button also
doubles as a fingerprint scanner and
it's very reliable and fast although it
may take a little bit longer than the s6
thanks to the a 5s slower processing
power and speaking of processing power
inside our a5 we have a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 615 although some regions may
have the x2 no 7580 two gigs of ram and
once again depending on your region you
may have the adrenal 4-5 GPU or the MAL
ET 720 you do only get 16 gigs of
internal storage so you'll probably need
to take advantage of the micro SD card
slot and due to the bump up in thickness
we also have a bump up in battery
capacity at 2900 million powers the s6
has some pretty bad battery life thanks
to this tiny battery and power sucking
display but here we have a decently
sized battery and more energy efficient
HD display so I was able to get some
good battery life out of the a5 four and
a half hours of screen on time will
probably be your average when using the
phone moderately and that's just enough
juice for me to last all day usually
being under 10% when it's time to sleep
now as for real performance when using
the phone it's what you would expect for
a more mid-range processing package
normal tasks like opening up apps and
diving in and out through the recent
apps screen is fast enough to create a
good workflow there's not really any
performance issues here except that
pesky TouchWiz briefing screen which
really isn't a processing power issue
just a software issue Geekbench and m2
to give the galaxy a5 some lower scores
at two thousand eight hundred and eighty
seven and thirty five thousand seven
hundred eighty-six respectively gaming
holds up pretty nicely here with not
many drop frames creating a very
playable
perience the galaxy a5 is running
Android lollipop 5.1.1 which is a little
disappointing for a recently released
phone especially with Android and being
announced soon but Samsung clearly is
saving their marshmallow version of
TouchWiz for the new Galaxy s7 lineup
the version of TouchWiz here is pretty
much identical to what we've been used
to on the galaxy phones of 2015 it's
very customizable without too many silly
features holding down on a blank area of
the homescreen will bring up options -
customizable wallpapers you can add
widgets apply themes and even change the
screen grid it's a pretty smooth
experience overall
with animations only stuttering once in
a while the notification pulldown is
designed very well without buttons
taking up too much room and if you're
not a fan of this color scheme you can
easily change it with a new theme the
recent apps screen has been unaltered
from stock however we do have an option
to trigger dual window mode which is a
great feature to have even if it's on a
smaller 5.2 inch screen it only works
with certain apps but still is very
useful oh and remember that briefing
screen I mentioned before it's pretty
laggy but it does display news articles
in a very appealing way but that lag may
be too much for some people and
thankfully you can disable it another
area where Samsung saves some money for
consumers is with the camera which is a
little unfortunate as pictures taken
with a5 are very far off from the galaxy
s6 s quality we have a 13 megapixel
rear-facing sensor with an aperture of
1.9 and optical image stabilization
pictures don't look too bad with some
extra sharpening going on to help create
sharper images but a big problem with
the camera is it it tends to overexpose
a lot and HDR doesn't really help too
much making just an overall brighter
image but when a photo isn't overexposed
the image actually comes out pretty nice
with good colors also four-to-three is
going to be the aspect ratio that you'll
shoot in if you want to take advantage
of the full 13 megapixels lo the lit
areas will create very dull images with
colors disappearing and lots of noise
showing up the front facing five
megapixel camera creates some very soft
looking images with not much sharpness
but as long as you are as bright as a
background you'll end up with an okay
shot however most of the time this is
hard to do and magnifies a rear facing
cameras problem of overexposing even
more there's definitely better
smartphone cameras out there for this
price range but still the a5
isn't a bad one you'll just need to do
some work when trying to snap a photo of
a scene with high contrast for the most
part the Galaxy a5 is the thicker galaxy
s6 with mid-range specs better battery
life and a lower resolution screen some
of these things are improvements and
some are definitely a step down although
they won't cause any major issues the
galaxy a5 is a great phone for users who
enjoyed the galaxy s6 but aren't a fan
of its two major problems high price and
mediocre battery life the galaxy a5
fixes these problems with an extra 20 or
30% of life throughout the day and is
about half the price of the s6 that is
release the a5 will only set you back
about 375 dollars for a galaxy phone has
a really great deal until you factoring
the biggest downgrade and disappointment
of the phone it's poor camera it's
nowhere near the quality of its flagship
brother and that may be a big deal
breaker for some people for around 375
dollars there are better options out
there for sure but if you're invested in
the Samsung ecosystem and love the
galaxy design the a5 won't disappoint
for its price and that concludes our
