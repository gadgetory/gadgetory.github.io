handy the Android authority app guy
where during the end of March and that
means it's time to take a look at the
best Android apps that were released
this month turret ID is a unique
application that really takes advantage
of the built-in fingerprint support from
Android marshmallow this application
allows you to unlock your computer with
your device's fingerprint scanner it's
fairly easy to use you download the
computer companion application set it up
with the mobile app and then unlock your
computer with your fingerprint it's only
available for Mac right now but the
developer says that Windows support is
on the way
ann's free is a new Google application
that allows you to pay for stuff just by
stating that you want to pay with Google
it's not available anywhere except
Silicon Valley but we expect support to
increase over time the idea is that you
say that you want to pay with Google
your picture then appears on the
register screen your ID is confirmed and
then you're paid up and ready to go
pound is a voice assistant application
that's been in beta since last year in
March it's shed its beta tag for good
and became available to the general
public this is an application that's
meant to compete with the likes of
Google now and Cortana and it does a
fairly decent job you can ask a variety
of questions sometimes multiple
questions at once and get answers for
them it also comes with built-in support
for uber navigation phone calls text
messages hotel search calculator a
converter and a whole lot more keyboard
is a keyboard released by Microsoft this
last month and it has some interesting
features the premise is that it contains
extensions that allow you to interact
with other applications without leaving
the app that you're in you can do things
like share documents contact information
or even translate text directly from the
keyboard without being required to open
another app it's a preview so there are
a ton of bugs but the concept is unique
and it should be improved over time
Clara is a new weather application that
seems to just do it right it shows you a
variety of weather stats and information
and most of it is presented in an
easy-to-read graph format you can get
both short term and long term forecasts
for virtually anywhere including
precipitation temperature or an even
cloud coverage it comes with some
theming elements a widget and it's all
wrapped up in material does
it's a good-looking simple weather
application that's entirely free to use
LastPass Authenticator is a new security
oriented application that gives you the
opportunity to have two-factor
authentication
almost anywhere it works alongside the
standard LastPass
app and makes you approve any action
taken in LastPass as an additional
measure of security this way if someone
tries to sign in without your consent
you can know about it faster and shut it
down immediately the Authenticator is a
free app that is just frosting on the
cake the Sony released PlayStation video
this last month and it's a solid
application the application will allow
you to view and watch any video that
you've either rented or purchased on
Sony's PlayStation Store the design is
solid and the application seems to work
well although it could use some
performance optimizations there is also
a fairly decent selection of movies and
TV shows that you can rent or purchase
from inside the app baskets is a newer
application that acts as a sort of
simplified alternative to pocket it
allows you to save articles videos and
other types of links for later viewing
and sharing you can organize them based
on what they are such as news research
recipes or funny stuff it also utilizes
material design and it looks damn nice
doing it it's a good alternative to
pockets if you want something that's a
little more simple the stream is a new
live streaming service that seems to
want to be a mixture of twitch and
periscope you can broadcast what's going
on with your camera like with periscope
foot you can also broadcast stuff like
gaming on your device screen like twitch
it seems to work pretty well so far and
you can browse content created by people
who are already using the service or you
can create your own content it's really
not that bad
protonmail is a new email client that
allows you to have end-to-end encryption
for your emails not only do you get
encryption but you can actually password
protect your emails which is kind of
cool you'll also get a decent-looking
application that performs well and looks
pretty decent although it could have
used a little more material design this
is great if you value security and it's
also 100% free and 100% open-source and
that about does it for this video ladies
and gentlemen if you liked it give it a
thumbs up and tell your friends about it
