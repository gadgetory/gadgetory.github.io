Authority channel the ability to manage
time wall is a special skill that can
spell survival for us in the urban
jungles where we live many of us rely on
the calendar planner apps on our iPhones
and androids to keep track of our
meetings and help us remember important
appointments if you ever need to copy
your iPhone calendar to your Android
phone then this tutorial is for you in
this video I'll show you three ways to
transfer calendar data from your Apple
phone to your Android phone let's talk
about the first method it's the easiest
the least complicated and it's perfect
for transferring just a few calendar
entries from iPhone to Android you'll
need only a Google account for this
method no need for an iCloud account
first set up your Google account on your
iPhone
usually do it by going to settings then
opening mail contacts calendars here tap
Add Account select Google on the list
and provide the needed info make sure
you also enable calendars after setting
up your account give the phone some time
to sync your Google data to your phone
also make sure that your iPhone is
connected to the Internet if you've
already added your Google account
previously just tap the Google account
name and enable calendars now let's
transfer some calendar entries on your
iPhone run the calendar app find the
specific calendar entry or event that
you want to transfer tap it to open the
event details page tap calendar from the
menu to see the available locations for
saving the calendar entry since you want
to save it to Google tap on your Google
account name on the list within a few
moments your calendar entry will now be
visible on your Android phone here it is
as I've mentioned this method is the
simplest and easiest but it can get
super tiresome for moving hundreds or
thousands of calendar entries to your
Android phone if you need to transfer
hundreds of calendar entries in one go
you'll like the next method
the second method involves saving your
iPhone calendar into a file and then
importing the file to your Google
Calendar it's a simple process you'll
need both a Google account and an iCloud
account let me show you how this is done
first set up and activate your iCloud
account on your iPhone let it sink your
phone calendar entries through the cloud
afterwards open iCloud comm and your
desktop web browser and log into iCloud
click on the calendar icon to open the
web-based calendar interface notice a
list of calendar names on the Left pane
click the signal icon for the calendar
that you wanna export in the pop up
balloon that appears check the box for
public calendar copy the URL that
appears below it next open a new browser
tab or window
paste the link that you just copied on
to the address bar but don't press the
Enter key just yet replace the web Cal
protocol with HTTP like this and now
press the Enter key your browser will
download the file with random characters
as file name go to where the file is
saved on your computer and rename the
file to something short and easy
afterwards
open another browser tab or window and
log into your Google Calendar you will
now import the saved file to your Google
Calendar on the Left pane of the
web-based Google Calendar interface find
the collapsible menu for other calendars
click on the menu arrow at its right and
click import calendar you'll see a pop
up dialog like this here select the file
to be imported in this case the file
that you downloaded from iCloud in this
dialog you can also choose the Google
Calendar the queue wish to import the
entries to click the import button to
upload the entries and presto we now see
the new calendar entries here on the
Google Calendar web interface it won't
take long before the new entries get
synced with your Android device let's
check yep here they are remember this
method is a one-way street if you add
new calendar events in your iPhone they
won't get synced to your Android phone
automatically instead you'll need to go
through the export import process all
over
if you want instantaneous calendars and
King between your iPhone and Android
you'll need the help of an Android app
called smooth sync for cloud calendar
you can buy the app for a few dollars
from the Google Play Store it's easy to
set up and use first install the smooth
sync app on your Android phone then on
your iPhone set up your iCloud account
and let it sink your phone calendar data
to the cloud then on your Android phone
run the smooth sync app and log in to
your iCloud account you will see a list
of your iCloud calendars select which
ones to sync and tap the finish button
that's all you need to do once syncing
is complete you should now be able to
see your iCloud calendar entries on your
Android phones calendar and syncing as
instantaneous but still one way changes
that you make in your iPhone calendar
will also be reflected in your google
calendar but not vice-versa your iPhone
in your Android phone may be two
completely different devices but who's
saying that never shall the two ever be
able to share information between them
as far as calendar entries are concerned
I've just shown you three ways to share
calendar data from the iPhone to Android
