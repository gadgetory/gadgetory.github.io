authority now we often talk about the
exterior of our smartphone maybe we talk
about the design language we might talk
about the materials the texture how it
feels in the hand and so on but have you
ever wondered about the inside of your
smartphone what's going on on the inside
what are all those different components
and what do they do well if you've ever
wondered please let me explain
so probably the most obvious component
of your smartphone is its display
although it has an outward facing
surface that we use to interact with the
smartphone it is actually an internal
component of the smartphone now display
technologies today and smartphones come
in two main types those based on LCDs
and those based on LEDs and the from
that we get the IPS technology and we
get AMOLED or Super AMOLED technology
now the difference between the two is it
on an LCD based display basically those
a back light that is shining through
some polarisers it's showing through
some filters and by manipulating the
crystal display we can get different
colors coming through on the other side
now that means it actually the light is
not being generated by the display
itself is being generated by this light
behind the display and then only some of
the light is coming through on to the
other side now with an AMOLED display
actually the LED bit LEDs light emitting
diodes so each of the pixels are made up
of these little light emitting diode
LEDs that produce probably red green and
blue as actually display itself that's
generating the different colors now the
advantage of an AMOLED display over an
LCD display is that when a pixel is off
initially showing black it is actually
not using any electricity because it's
actually black it's switched off that
means you get power saving also means
you get great black very deep blackening
means you get a good contrast whereas
with an LCD when something is black what
actually happening is the crystal
display is being manipulated so that
none of the light gets through but the
light itself is still being generated in
the backlight behind it so there's no
saving advantages out at all and next up
is the battery now the batteries come in
two main types either those that can be
changed user removable batteries you pee
off the back you can take the back drag
and put another one in all those that
are sealed inside your mobile phone
now battery today mainly use a lithium
ion technology which means you don't
have to worry about that kind of memory
effect we had many many years ago about
how you charge your phone and have a
charge in discharge and so on we don't
have those problems today however the
size of the battery is an important
factor and the average today seems to be
about 3000 milliamp hours for a 5.5 inch
kind of device now once you go deep
inside your smart phones the biggest
most important component is the system
on a chip now the system on a chip is
not just a CPU the central processing
unit it's actually a whole bunch of
different bits of silicon that are all
put together to give you a highly
functional system on a chip so you've
got the CPU you've got the GPU you've
got l1 and l2 caches you've got a
display processor you've got a video
processor you've got a DSP there's a
whole bunch of things that go in there
but make this system on a chip now it
comes to CPU today all basically all
smartphones use the system architecture
from arm so arm work by licensing their
intellectual property their designs to
other people and they incorporate them
inside of their chip so you might heard
of things like the cortex a53 the cortex
a57 the cortex a 72 equals a temp
diseases are all arm designed CPU cores
that companies like Qualcomm and Samsung
and Huawei and media take all put inside
of their system on chips there is
actually a second category of arm type
processes which are those companies are
owned and architectural license from arm
which means they have the right to
design their own CPU calls as long as
they are compatible with the arm
instruction set and Cole chrome has one
of those licenses so does Apple
interesting enough so does Samsung as oh
chips like the cryo call that you find
in the cold core
eight 2821 were proprietary design chips
by qualcomm using an armed architectural
license and next up is the GPU there are
three main players you've got qualcomm
with the Adreno GPU is we've got armed
with their Mali GPU and you've got your
imagination with their power the our
GPUs imagination really aren't that
popular as arm and Qualcomm you find
them occasionally Paul Cortona mediatek
chip you might find them in a samsung
chip occasionally but mainly there you
find them in Apple's processors where as
Qualcomm all of their Snapdragon
processors have the Adreno GPU net and
basically chips from Samsung and from
MediaTek and from while they all have
GPUs from arm in them now once you have
this powerful CPU GPU combination there
are still a few more blocks that you
need to really get that full multimedia
experience on your smartphone one of
them is a display processor actually the
interface between what's coming out of
the GPU and CPU and your LCD or LED
display and then you also have a video
processor when you're watching YouTube
when you're watching Netflix all that
data is coming down compressed mp4 for
example and it needs to be decode now it
can be decoded in software but it's much
better if it's decoded in hardware and
that's the video processor but it also
does any coding so if you're using a
video chat application you're talking to
somebody what's being captured on the
camera needs to be encoded so it can be
sent up into the Internet and then on to
the other person again the video
processor that in hardware and they're
all included on the system on a chip now
no system can run without memory and
without storage so when we talk about
memory we'll talk about random access
memory RAM and a typical Android 7 base
smartphone will have about 2 gigabytes
of RAM as a minimum and then we might
have 4 gigabytes as pretty usual there
are some now with 6 and let's talk about
some coming with 8 so that's random
access memory it comes in two types
you've got lpddr3 and lpddr4 the LP bit
being low power where it reduces the
voltage compared to what you get on the
desktop and obviously lpddr4 is faster
than lpddr3 and then there is internal
storage that
the amount of storage space you've got
for the Android operating system for
your apps and for all your multimedia 8
gigabytes kind of exists in some low-end
phones 16 gigabytes is really the kind
of the minimum practical minimum and
then of course you've got 32 64 and so
on after that one question of course is
that do you really get 8 16 or so 2
gigabytes of space no you don't because
Android itself takes up a fair portion
of that space so if you've got an 8
gigabyte so you may only get 3 or 4
gigabytes of free space on it if you've
got a 32 gigabytes though you may find
that even as much as 7 or 8 gigabytes is
taken over by androids or things like
the operation itself and for
over-the-air updates and other things
like that so you're not always going to
get the full amount that's written on
the box and of course smartphones are
still phone so somewhere in the inside
of your smartphone there needs to be
some connectivity options cellular
options and today of course we talk
about 2g 3G and 4G LTE and to talk to
those networks as failing networks your
phone needs a modem and all of the major
SOC builders have their own modem so
Qualcomm have got their range of modems
Samsung have while they have and
mediatek have now the top three Samsung
Qualcomm and Huawei basically are pretty
equal with each other Qualcomm is
probably always in the lead just a
little bit but you hear you talk about
the most advanced LTE modems you can get
on the market and mediatek because it
aims for a different category of phones
they tend to have still support for what
4G LTE but much slower category of
modems they're not advancing as quick as
the other ones but that's not so bad
because remember you might have a smart
phone that supports absolutely latest
and greatest LTE standards but if your
own network at your home country doesn't
support them then it really doesn't make
any difference because mediatek are
going for that different segment market
other connectivity of course options
beyond LTE are called Bluetooth Wi-Fi
and NFC and they'll be chip inside of
your phone but specifically work for
those things and they tend to be built
by companies like Broadcom and in XP so
if you hear those names
there the people are doing the
connectivity chips in your phone and
then of course we come to the camera now
most phones nowadays have a front-facing
camera and a rear-facing camera inside
that camera you're going to find three
different components there's a sensor
which actually detects the light
there's the lenses that you that light
comes through and then there's the image
processor now obviously we know about
megapixel count we've been talking about
that for years I've got an 8 megapixel
camera or a 16 megapixel camera but
megapixel count isn't the only thing
that's going on here the really the
sensitivity of the sensor is incredibly
important and how much noise it
generates in low-light situations is
also important and once the light has
entered through the lens and it hits the
sensor that data needs to be processed
to create you a photograph particularly
when we're talking about things like
filters and the different except you can
add and we're talking about HDR
photography there is a piece of hardware
called the image signal processor which
basically takes the data from the camera
sensor and it creates the JPEG files
that we actually have which are our
actual photos and all of these major SOC
s have image since image processors
built into the SOC so it can do that
stuff like HDR and the other image color
corrector and other image processing
like that of course we also use our
smartphones for audio whether it's just
it having a conversation with somebody
whether it is listening to music whether
it's watching a YouTube video audio is
an important part and there are several
different components to the audio system
in your mobile phone of course there's
the speaker's themselves sometimes we
have rear speakers I've seen a foam in
the side speaker often they're on the
bottom or edge of a smartphone of course
there are the front-facing speakers
which generally today I'll consider to
be the best because you can get on a
phone but the speaker's aren't the only
thing that you need you also need a DSP
a digital signal processor which will do
things like the equalization processing
for the audio that's coming out of your
mobile phone anomie to a decade digital
to analog converter and that takes the
digital signals the ones and the zeroes
in turns it into an analog signal but
can power a speaker or go down your
headphones in
to your into your ears and that
obviously again you get different
quality Dax some are more noisy some are
higher quality and that and some MOT
smartphone manufacturers make a big deal
about the DAC they put inside their
phones and then lastly a few more
features are mentioned you've got a GPS
chip somewhere your phone that's kind of
useful the location services detecting
the satellite signals that works out
where it is on the planet you've
actually got a tiny little vibrator
motor so that when you your phone
vibrates when you've got it on silence
maybe that little motor in there
actually does that there's of course
support which you use for charging and
for data transfer that I would be a
micro USB port or a USB type-c port and
of course there's the headphone jack
which you might not get on some phones
nowadays but hopefully you do also have
a headphone jack otherwise you're just
relying on bluetooth only for connecting
to your audio equipment
