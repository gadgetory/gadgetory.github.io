you would ask the world for a better
mode of transportation you would have
simply asked for a faster cheaper horse
and carriage not even knowing that an
automobile was a possibility so today I
want to talk about the new trends in the
industry how do we reach the next
billion or two billion smartphone users
and what's that going to mean for you
and me so today we're having fun geeking
out about deacon out and talking about
how Android can reach the next billion
to two billion users and we're also
Paris Corbin live the bottom line is the
market still needs to grow according to
the latest bi intelligence report 1.3
billion smartphones were shipped in 2014
a growth rate of twenty nine percent
over 2013 growth in 2013 was around
forty five percent so although the rate
of growth may be slowing the firm is
still predicting strong increase in the
number of shipments year after year by
2020 bi intelligence suggests that 3.4
billion smartphones will have been
shipped now I think it's safe to say
that emerging markets will lead this
charge leading the growth and
smartphones is a surgeon upgrades and
developed markets and the accelerated
shift from feature phones to smartphones
this can be observed in the booming
Indian smartphone market which has
attracted a number of manufacturers
looking to expand out from the equally
competitive Chinese market using this as
a guide from the next 1 billion
smartphones approximately 240 million
will come from China 170 million from
India and around 30 to 50 million each
from a selection of growing economies
including Indonesia Brazil and the
Philippines even the u.s. is expected to
contribute around 70 million new units
but most other developed mobile regions
are expected to contribute only about 10
million new units each year so what many
people aren't talking about is new
business models and how that's going to
affect the smartphone industry so for
example Huawei is trying to soon sell
you their phones directly from an
e-commerce store that they're going to
create for Western buyers so instead of
going through your carrier into a two or
three-year contract you would just buy
the phone off contract directly from
them which my friends is the way to go
I've done like two shows on that topic
entirely and you don't want to be
getting to a contract if you can
absolutely avoid it I know it's more
expensive up front to buy a phone off
contract for four or five six hundred
dollars but do it because you were going
to be saving quite a bit of money in the
long run that's really important now
imagine for a moment as smartphones get
cheaper and cheaper to produce it
becomes more viable for manufacturers to
sell us their devices directly on their
websites now if you think that's not
possible remember how excited people got
over the Nexus 5 crazy I mean for 300
bucks you got a fantastic phone for 50
more bucks you've got an even better
phone it's inevitable it's going to
happen Xiaomi is trying to do it and I
think more manufacturers are going to do
that and that means that more people can
buy a better phone not having to go
through a carrier with the move to new
markets comes a new set of consumer
expectations and purchasing habits
features such as dual SIM capability and
value for money are a little different
from what we're used to seeing in
western markets price has been a major
point of contest in these growing
markets which is seen the increasing use
of e-commerce to help manage stock
levels and keep prices under control in
India Chinese brands have been
undercutting established brands and this
has been chipping away at their market
share imagine being a fly on the wall
when I tried to explain to my mother
that this YouTube channel reaches more
viewers than her favorite television
show yeah I don't know we get on no 12
15 million viewers per month which
Dwarfs most cable channels yeah imagine
trying to explain that to someone 15
years ago they would not have gotten at
my point is that maybe the next billion
2 billion users of smartphones won't
need smartphones maybe it'll be
something totally different that we did
not expect like we did not expect most
of the consequences that the internet
brought to us so if access to the
information that we want is locked
between these tiny screens of a phone a
tablet or a desktop computer that's
really limiting I've talked about this
before I may be boring some of you but
this is a tiny little window what if it
were everywhere on everything on my wall
all's windows your car I mean everything
has an IP address everything has an
operating system that is intuitive and
easy to access so I don't need to be
locked and chained to a phone when it's
everywhere on everything now that could
be five years away that could be 20
years away I don't know but I'm
suggesting that maybe this is totally
different from what we expect what do
you think let me know in the comments
below so I used to have a website called
how to become dot TV and inevitably I
lost people who were going to how to
become calm because they assumed if it's
a website it must be a dot-com why
because no domain name extension tells
your story with the same level of trust
as a.com or.net domain name dot com
and.net domain name extensions and Jack
credibility in to your online presence
and who doesn't want more credibility
you can say fifteen percent on domain
name and web hosting is when you use our
coupon code android at domain.com check
out don't forget fifteen percent off
when you use our coupon code android
when you think domain names think
domain.com thanks for watching android
army my name is Jason I also want to
thank my fellow Paris coppers thanks for
watching live and given the input and
dialoguing back and forth it was a real
experience I'll probably try it again
and let you guys know an hour to before
about shoot when I'm about to broadcast
live thanks a lot for those of you who
joined me you don't wanna forget about
my brothers in Android who are always
working super hard to be your source for
all things android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
