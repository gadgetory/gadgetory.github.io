brought to you by domain.com we got note
5 leaks sony xperia leaks and the shield
tablet is on fire in a bad way this past
week evleaks tweeted out the probable
specs of the galaxy note5 allegedly
including an exynos 7420
system-on-a-chip 4 gigabytes of ram 32
gigabytes of internal storage a 5.6
6-inch 2560 x 1440 display a 16
megapixel rear camera likely featuring
the ISO self-censor that samsung
unveiled earlier this week a 5-megapixel
front-facing camera probably wide-angle
with android 5.1 point 1 and sadly my
friends no SD card support now the most
interesting part of these photos
showcase a stylus doc it was previously
believed that the stylus would have Auto
ejecting capabilities then rumors
suggested that it would be a push to
release mechanism these rumours were
then contradicted by a Korean source
which indicates that the stylus release
method will be similar to all the other
previous note handsets now Experian's
will be happy to know that we have two
alleged leaks of two different
experiences earlier this week Russian
tech site high tech mail.ru leaked both
devices in full giving us a good look at
what is possibly sony's upcoming
smartphones the experience c5 ultra is
arguably the most interesting of the two
it has a big 6 inch full HD display that
extends all the way to the left and
right sides of the chassis giving it an
almost bezel free aesthetic according to
the leak the bezels on the left and
right sides measure only point 8
millimeters in length which is a very
thin indeed the c5 ultra also sports a
13 megapixel rear and front-facing
camera complete with a front-facing
flash in addition it's powered by an
octa-core 1.7 gigahertz MediaTek
processor 2 gigabytes of ram 16
gigabytes of on-board storage microSD
expansion support as well as a 2930
milliamp hour battery according to
recent leaks the device should launch
somewhere around three hundred fifty
dollars us the c5 ultra also sports a 13
megapixel rear and front-facing camera
complete with a front-facing flash in
addition it's powered by an octa-core
1.7 gigahertz MediaTek processor 2
gigabytes of ram 16 gigabytes of
on-board storage microSD expansion
support as well as 2930 milliamp hour
battery according to recent leaks the
device could launch for somewhere around
three hundred fifty dollars us the
Experian five on the other hand looks to
feature a similar design aesthetic to
that of the Zed three years at three
plus which unfortunately blends in with
most other Sony devices on the market it
comes with a 5 inch full HD IPS LCD an
octo core MediaTek Helio x10 processor 3
gigabytes of ram 16 gigabytes of
internal storage and microSD expansion
this device also comes with a 13
megapixel camera on the front and back
and has an IP 65 and IP 68 certification
it would likely launch somewhere around
four hundred dollars us and be available
in black silver and gold color options
now nvidia is apparently recalling some
of their shield tablets due to a fire
hazard because Nvidia just announced a
recall program affecting shield tablet
sold over the last year nvidia is asking
affected shield owners to submit a claim
to receive a replacement device not all
units are affected in order to check to
see if you need to replace your shield
you must follow the steps at this link
right here Nvidia did not detail the
reasons behind the recall other than to
say that quote tablets can overheat and
pose a fire hazard unquote from the
multitude of reports about injury and
damage caused by faulty electronics this
is not an issue you want to take lightly
so make sure to go through the recall as
soon as possible if any one of you guys
had that problem with your shield tablet
