authority and we're taking a look at the
Nubia z-9 this is Nubia is latest
smartphone which has actually been
available in China for a while now but
they're planning to bring it to other
markets including the US which is why
they're announcing it here at Eve 2016
the one we're taking a look at is the
all silver model but it also comes in a
two-tone black and gold color that looks
a little bit nicer and also comes with
slightly better specs it has an
all-metal build that feels really sturdy
and puts the build quality on par with a
lot of other flagships that we've seen
on the market but Nubia says the three
main highlights that make this phone
stand out is the display camera and
battery life it's got a 5.5 inch LCD
display but unlike most flagships this
year it has a 1080p display instead of
quad HD but it still looks pretty good
with plenty of sharpness and vibrant
colors the most eye-catching part about
this screen is that it has virtually no
bezels on the left and right sides and
when you look at it head on it looks
like the screen runs completely edge to
edge we've seen this before on previous
Nubia devices but it's still really
impressive to look at and it makes you
feel like you're literally holding
nothing but a screen in your hands the
fact that the side bezels are so thin
also makes its phone feel a lot more
compact than other phones with a 5.5
inch screen there's a 16 megapixel
camera on the back with optical image
stabilization and phase detection
autofocus and it sounds like your
typical standard smartphone camera when
looking at on paper but Nubia made a
pretty big deal about all the various
different camera modes on the Z 11 that
make it unique for example there's a
clone mode that will overlap several
images on top of each other to make it
appear as if there's multiples of the
same person or object it's a pretty old
trick that can be done manually with a
DSLR and some editing in post but the
z11 does all automatically and it's not
perfect but it does a pretty decent job
of stitching all the photos together
even if you're just using your hands to
stabilize the camera
another interesting mode on the z11 is
called electronic aperture which lets
you dial in the aperture from anywhere
between F 2.8 to F 44 and it's not a
true aperture change obviously but the
purpose of this mode is to let you alter
how much motion blur you get in the
background while still keeping
everything in the foreground in focus
and it's a pretty neat feature but
depending
on the aperture you pick this will also
affect the shutter speed so you need to
keep a very steady hand if you're
looking for those extremely blurred out
backgrounds there's a 3000 milliamp hour
battery inside which is a fairly average
size for a 2016 smartphone but Nubia
says they've done a lot of battery
optimizations to make the phone last
longer than other smartphones with the
same capacity and it also has built-in
support for quick charge 3.0 to make it
really easy to fill up the rest of the
specs are pretty typical of what you
would find in a lot of flagship that
came out this year there's a Snapdragon
820 with 4 gigabytes of RAM and 64 gigs
of internal storage and if you opt for
the black and gold version this will
come with 6 gigs of ram and double the
internal storage at 128 gigabytes
there's also a micro SD card slot
located on the left side of the phone if
you're looking to add even more storage
going around the z11 you'll find the
power and volume keys on the left side a
headphone jack and IR blaster on top and
along the bottom is a USB type-c port
flanked by what looks like stereo
speakers but it's actually just a single
speaker and a microphone
the z11 also has a fingerprint sensor on
the back but aside from providing
additional security it also functions as
a shortcut for taking a screenshot a
long screenshot or a screen recording by
long pressing on it the software is
Android marshmallow with Nubia Zone
custom skin and it's not the nicest or
most appealing looking skin but it does
come with some really interesting
features that take advantage of the
super thin side bezels
you can swipe up and down with two
fingers along both edges to adjust the
screens brightness swipe inward to skip
to any home screen or swipe up and down
along either edge to quickly switch
between any apps that you have running
in the background and you can even swipe
rapidly along the edges to clear all the
apps out of memory the z11 will be
available in Europe starting at 499
euros but we don't know the exact
details just yet on when it will be
coming to the States or how much is
going to cost but overall it's a solid
smartphone from Nubia that's very
comparable to a lot of other flagships
on the market we'll definitely keep you
posted on pricing and availability as we
find out more about the Nubia z11 on
android 30.com but let us know your
thoughts on the Nubia Z 11 down the
comments below and keep it tuned here to
Android Authority because there's a lot
more to come from FIFA 2016 here in
Berlin
