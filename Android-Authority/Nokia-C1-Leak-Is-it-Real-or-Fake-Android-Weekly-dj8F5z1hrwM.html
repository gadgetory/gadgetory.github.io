about the supposed render of the much
rumored Nokia c1 you decide
unfortunately last week's Nokia c1
render turned out to be just a fan
concept but this week we have a picture
of the rumored smartphone in the wild
which is much trickier to fake the
photographs give us a quick look at the
front and back of the phone where we can
see a rear camera with an LED flash a
front camera on the top left and a
couple of buttons possibly the volume
rocker on the side of the handset the
bezel design seems very similar to the
render but it is impossible to tell if
we're looking at a metal unibody or just
a plastic case the pictures also come
with their own set of rumors the
smartphone is apparently sporting a
5-inch 1080p display rather than a 720p
panel that was previously mentioned the
phone was also said to run Android 6.0
marshmallow right out of the box and it
certainly seems to have a rather stock
looking Settings menu the Intel
system-on-a-chip and two gigabytes of
RAM rumor also persists your thoughts
I'm thinking it's probably real or at
least a prototype now let's talk the
Moto X force and it's supposed
shatterproof display just a few weeks
ago we began hearing rumors about a new
smartphone from Motorola called the Moto
X force codenamed bounce featuring a 5.4
three inch quad HD shatterproof display
the unannounced Motorola smartphone
sounds like quite a flagship so far but
how much cash could one pay in order to
receive one of these units according to
up leaks the leaker who has given us
every Moto X force rumor so far the
device will launch this December for
around six hundred and twenty eight
dollars u.s. the Moto X is rumored to
come with a quote shatterproof display
according to other rumors the force
could launch with a qualcomm snapdragon
810 processor three gigabytes of ram 32
or 64 gigabytes of on-board storage a 21
megapixel rear-facing camera likely the
same sensor found on the style and a 5
megapixel front-facing camera and a big
3760 million
our battery and they blew pure Excel has
been officially announced blue the
manufacturer behind last year's popular
life pure Excel smartphone has released
a new device this week that boasts some
impressive specs and achieved price
point the blue pur XL is the latest to
come from the florida-based company and
it's one of the more powerful devices
that has ever been produced the blue pur
XL comes with a six inch quad HD Super
AMOLED display with Gorilla Glass 3 a
64-bit 2 gigabyte mediatek mt6752 end
processor 3 gigabytes of RAM 64
gigabytes of on-board storage and a
micro SD expansion slot up to 64
gigabytes it has a 24 megapixel rear
facing camera and 8 megapixel front
facing camera and a non-removable 3,500
milliamp hour battery with quick
charging capabilities that runs android
5.1 lollipop right out of the box what's
more this device even features a
OneTouch fingerprint scanner below the
camera module on the phone's backside
this is a feature we don't normally see
in inexpensive smartphones and it should
be a welcome addition to the handset but
perhaps the best part about this new
device is the price point the pure XL
will launch exclusively on Amazon on
Tuesday September 29th for only $349 us
with 4G LTE support on both t-mobile and
AT&amp;amp;T networks
well it's only September 2015 and we're
already hearing rumors about the galaxy
s7 otherwise known as project lucky the
galaxy s7 seems to be going by the
codenamed project lucky as several
mentions of such a device have appeared
in a couple of benchmarks recently
Qualcomm is gearing up to launch its
Snapdragon 820 system on a chip in early
2016 and a Samsung lucky device has
passed through and tutu's benchmark
sporting this chip the handset also
sports four gigabytes of RAM which
matches the amount included in Samsung's
most recent smartphones along with a 16
megapixel rear camera and a 5.7 inch
display a separate rumor from Korea
suggests that Samsung may be preparing
to launch two sizes of the Galaxy S six
at the same
time one with a 5.1 inch qHD display and
one at five point eight inches possibly
with a 4k resolution that would match
the sony xperia z5 premium now don't
just take that with a pinch of salt you
may need a host spoonful heck just chug
the whole box thanks for watching into
an army my name is Jace you can follow
me right here and I will follow you in
