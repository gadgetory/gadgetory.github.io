Authority what's going on everybody and
today we're comparing two phones that
for the most part are exactly the same
this is the Sony Xperia Z versus the
Sony Xperia ZL obviously we're going to
start with the look and feel the Xperia
Z brought a design we don't see too
often these days a very blocky
rectangular designed with rigid corners
this rather unique look has brought the
Z quite a bit of design praise and for
good reason it really is a quite sleek
glass encased Zone glass on both sides
makes the Z very fingerprint prone
however and the button layout is on the
right side with the large and hard to
miss silver power button above the
volume rockers all ports are then
covered by pieces of plastic to help one
of the Z's main draws its water and dust
resistance the Xperia Z L on the other
hand isn't all glass but the front is
reminiscent of that rectangular design
there is however a really cool LED light
that isn't just a circular poles found
at the bottom instead it is like a line
that is very Sony like in spirit the
back though is made of a textured
plastic that does help lower the
slippage the low cover on the bottom
houses the SD and micro SIM slots and is
arguably the only real eyesore the
button layout is a little different the
silver power button is in the middle
again while the volume rockers are now
above but below the power button is the
CIO's main edition here which is the
dedicated camera button and as far as
the size goes it is about five
millimeters shorter than the Z but a few
millimeters thicker this slightly
smaller size in terms of its form factor
does make a difference though so for
designed the Xperia Z is the phone that
causes more heads to turn and I'm being
serious there whenever I had the Xperia
Z out someone wanted to know what it was
because it wasn't only different it was
also quite attractive however the CEO
gets the point for feel because it is
the most compact body you can find on a
5 inch screen the real estate on the
front is over 75% covered in just the
1080p screen and when the bezel is that
small the body shrinks too so this is
probably one of the best handling phones
if not the best handling phone with a 5
inch screen and that's really darn cool
speaking of the screen there really
isn't much of a
contest here both the Z and the Z L have
a 5-inch 1080p screen capable of 441
pixels per inch they are very sharp
displays that benefit from the Bravia
Engine especially when you just look at
them dead-on but unfortunately you're
going to get the same bad viewing angles
on both devices as the fidelity of the
displays are greatly degraded at even
moderate angles sure you can change the
white balance on the ZL screen in the
options or the settings but that doesn't
fix the bad angles so as long as you
keep your eyes straight onto the display
you'll get a great experience in what
basically seems like a small sony tv in
the palm of your hand
hardware in performance turns this into
a story of what exactly do you want
performance wise you get the same
package in either device the 1.5
gigahertz Snapdragon s4 pro with an
Adreno 320 GPU 2 gigabytes of RAM are
available and then you have 16 or 32
gigabytes of memory expandable by SD
card slots but the hardware in the Z is
all water resistant up to one meter in
water which is pretty nice
it makes for a cool trick to show off to
your friends but can also be a saving
grace in an accident if someone spills
water or what-have-you onto your device
meanwhile the not waterproof or
water-resistant Xperia Z L has an IR
blaster that allows it to communicate
with various devices like TVs or blu-ray
players which effectively make it
replace your remotes unfortunately both
have their advantages in these cases and
thus fulfill particularly different
needs water resistance is cool but so is
natively being able to turn on pretty
much any TV you might have we got
another tie here battery life doesn't
change this result at all either even
though the Xperia Z L has 40 more
milliamps in its battery than the one
found in the Z which is at 23:30 you
still get the same decent battery life
either way as far as software goes you
do get the same jellybean 4.1.2
operating system covered in Xperia
flavours in either phone they're nice
putting together jellybean features with
Ice Cream Sandwich looks and Xperia
additions like small apps for
multitasking the only real advantage
here is found in the Xperia Z L because
of its IR blaster you get the remote
control application which allows you to
take control of pretty much any device
that
you might have for media like TVs
set-top boxes for cable or blu-ray
players it may not work right away but
there is a manual setup mode so that you
can make it work when you need to with a
little bit of effort it does provide for
extra functionality in the Xperia Z L
and that's why it gets the slight edge
in this one and finally we have the
cameras the rear cameras on both devices
are 13 megapixel shooter is powered by
Exmor RS sensors both are more than
decent in quality and superior auto
works quite well the Xperia ZL has a
rather unique relic in its toolbox
though that dedicated camera button it
works really nicely and kind of reminds
you above days that were long gone when
most phones came with a dedicated camera
button but the real story here is in the
front cameras the Z has a two point two
megapixel shooter while Desio only has
two megapixels however it's the
placement of the Xperia Z us
front-facing camera in the lower right
corner that is quite deliberate
apparently Sony found that users look
lower into the screen then top located
cameras can really capture so lowering
its position makes things look much more
natural during a video call while that
might be a nice gimmick I personally
don't know anyone that truly cares if
their callers are looking right into
their eyes so ultimately it comes down
to whether or not you really want that
dedicated camera button at the sacrifice
of water resistance the performance when
it comes down to it is the same on both
so you can take your pick between these
two so in the end was it really any
surprise that both of these phones are
so neck-and-neck ultimately you're
getting the same performance in two
bodies that fulfill different needs I
really think that both phones are really
great so it comes down to which feature
means more to you water resistance is
really good but I personally love the
smaller form factor of the Xperia Z L
those few millimeters do make a
difference and thus are preferred to
have the most compact 5-inch phone
available right now the IR blaster and
dedicated camera button are both bonuses
to this so if these features altogether
equal greater than water resistance for
you then the ZL is your phone that's
exactly what happened with me how do you
