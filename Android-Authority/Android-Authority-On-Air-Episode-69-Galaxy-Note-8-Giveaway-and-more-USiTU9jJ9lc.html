the original Android hangout show on
Google+ I'm Derrick Ross I'm Dan
Charlton and I'm Jonathan Franklin this
week we're gonna hit up the Android
nation that is supposedly coming to New
Delhi and some other news from the
Android ecosystem and maybe even some
information about balloons are they 99
of them are they red I don't know as a
bad joke we're gonna have some devices
such as the new Galaxy camera some
interesting devices from Samsung Huawei
is doing some cool stuff HTC is I'm
impressed with the HTC device we're
going to talk about um we're gonna give
away a secret code for a chance at
winning a Galaxy Note 8.0 so you want to
stay tuned once again stay tuned because
we're gonna give away a secret code a
chance to win a Galaxy Note 8 and then
we're gonna talk about apps and some
carrier news and some patents
specifically intellectual Ventures you
know Nokia Microsoft that they're doing
some bad stuff and you know what and in
Falcon Pro everyone's favorite Twitter
client has gone through some rough times
we're gonna talk about that as well all
right so so let's get started about this
this contest I mentioned a few moments
ago tomorrow Friday we're going to
officially launch a giveaway for a
Galaxy Note 8.0 it's the it's an
international contest so no matter where
you're at on the planet you can go ahead
and enter oh you want a place to receive
mail oh yeah if you can read if you have
a mailing address so you know I mean we
will ship it to you
it's the 16 gigabyte galaxy note it's
white the it has 2 gigs of ram if you're
not familiar with a device at 1280 by
800 screen resolution 1.6 gigahertz
Exynos 4400 16 Giga and I said 2 gigs
battery lasts for about eight hours five
megapixel rear web camera so and has a
stylus you know that's the biggest thing
with the notes right this stylus I guess
I should have mention that it comes with
the S the S Pen not just a stylus
actually I think I downplay that by
calling it a stylus it's an S Pen it as
over a hundred different sensing
capabilities and it works better on that
size of device too okay so so once again
we're gonna give away a secret code a
little bit later in the show and what
you're gonna do is you're gonna take
this code you're gonna visit Android
authority comm you're gonna go to the
contest and you're gonna enter this
secret code and it's gonna give you an
additional chance to win and then next
week we're gonna do the same thing for
those of you that are watching the show
and listening to the show we're gonna
give you an exclusive chance to get
another entry so you want to watch and
listen this week as well as next week
for two additional chances to win a
Galaxy Note 8.0 free of charge shipped
to any place on the planet with a valid
shipping address thanks Dan
alright so so let's talk about some
ecosystem news before we spill the beans
in that secret code alright so Google is
supposedly planning Android nation I
like that we should go try to register
that domain names it's not available I
mean if it is available
so anyways Android nation retail
brick-and-mortar stores are coming to
New Delhi
and their goal is to eventually then
further spread out throughout India in
the future they're gonna they're gonna
support you know multiple handsets from
different OEMs with spicemobile from
Asia the stores are gonna Center on
hands-on experiences
accessories technical assistance from
gurus like us and experienced guys
giving demos and more basically it's
every Android fans wet dream
giving you all the information and
devices and Android it's gonna give you
a chance to play with devices and you
know apparently that's not a very big
thing you know in in a in India
it's a huge market and it's tough to
have you know people go to places to
actually see all these different devices
that are available to them so so that
that's why they're doing that there and
you know what I'm a little jealous of of
that side of the world you know I want
to walk into an Android nation you know
I want to walk in and geek out and see
all the cool Google stuff all the cool
Android stuff you know definitely but I
think I think Google smart to do it and
we're really still emerging markets for
the cell phone industry and the
smartphone industry in particular so I
think it gives them an opportunity to
get in quite literally on the ground
floor in India the market with over a
billion consumers and really hub market
that Apple just hasn't been able to play
in and so it's going to push more I'm
curious to see how this goes I would
love to see it come to other markets but
you know there's a lot of talk about it
it just wouldn't work right now at least
another market so I'm curious is how
this pans out so we're gonna talk about
Facebook for a second I know you know
Google+ country Google country I wanna
talk about Facebook but uh Facebook
today announced that vine was coming to
Instagram right oh wait a second wait a
second no no they announced that
Instagram you remember they bought them
a year ago they announced that Instagram
was going to get not six second videos
like Twitter's vine has they're gonna
get 15-second videos so almost three
times is good Google offers you
unlimited seconds on YouTube yeah yeah
you know it's a so it's not for
everybody but vine you know has a lot of
users and it's growing more popular and
brands are looking into it so you know I
There is obviously a market for it but
it's interesting that you know Facebook
or Instagram you know felt the need to
to be able to do that so the videos will
play in your feed
but they won't automatically loop like
they do on vine over and over and over
again so you'll see the 15-second video
once and if you want to watch it again
you'll have to tap play again actually I
believe the update is now available in
the Play Store so go ahead and check
that out
make us some 15 second videos letting us
know how awesome Android is and share
the link in the comments and we'll check
them out so Dan are you gonna you gonna
install Instagram something on Instagram
user now you can install it just to make
15-second videos no definitely not
I don't really understand are they
silent well if you don't make any noise
yes but if they're not and like I have
my stream open I could have potentially
offensive language just randomly
streaming on my computer for 15 seconds
at a time yeah so it's not a photo bomb
you know cuz that's Instagram right so
it's a video bomb so basically just you
you come up with a whole bunch of
obscenities and you're not safe for work
content you need to start streaming in
your stream and you offend everybody
that you're following right yeah I mean
I you're near lose followers pretty
quickly so I would suggest to not do
that but but yes it is possible yeah I'm
not sure I want that it seems very
intrusive I want to watch a video I'm
gonna click on it I don't want to just
start playing don't you hate it when you
land on a website that has some video
content on it just starts playing yeah
you have some chick that comes out and
she's like hey I'm gonna use a sexy
woman to sell you a product in a
marketing blah blah blah blah blah
uterine yeah yeah kind of website you
going to Derek I would prefer not to
admit this on a public forum John you
know the NSA knows what that's a bad I
do like the the video service provider
workers are now degrading into who's
offering more seconds yeah yeah I know
it's not hours of YouTube sockets
now Twitter's going to come back and get
you 18 Oh beat that Facebook and YouTube
finally here's a competitor eventually
alright so the next thing we're gonna
talk about balloons and there's not now
well there's probably more than 99 of
them but and they're definitely not read
the more of like a from what I've seen
the more of like a clear plastic but
they could be read so so anyways Project
loon was announced and Project loon is
putting basically weather balloons
balloons in the stratosphere to form a
massive mesh network with them to bring
Internet connectivity all over the world
more importantly to bring Internet
connectivity to places that don't have
it or it's very sparse or very
inexpensive very expensive and you're
looking at 3G or higher speeds
now which isn't horrible when you're
talking you don't have internet access
you know it's better than nothing and
it's pretty it's pretty neat the the
balloons are gonna use hardware that
will being the signals you know down to
homes and homes will have a special
receiver on them then coincidentally
enough receiver actually looks like a
little balloon and the balloons will
actually you know ride up and down in
the winds in the stratosphere so they'll
be they'll be able to use that to
navigate so when a bunch of balloons you
start heading and over to an area maybe
and they're not getting is they're
getting you know too much coverage in
there and in another area is lacking
they can then either make the balloon go
up or make the balloon go down depending
on which draft which wind stream they're
trying to maneuver into and then to
actually steer them that way so they'll
be able to move them around and and not
have you know big dead zones it seems
like I mean this technology is very new
very experimental and they're they're
testing it out right now in New Zealand
so if you're watching us in New Zealand
try to get in on this you know uh it's
very very interesting
I think it's very cool dan the John what
are your thoughts on this yeah it's well
it's something that really opens up a
lot of other markets like for business
and education you know I don't think
it's ever a bad thing to you know get
the power of the Internet or even you
know you're talking about very heavily
you know agricultural places that can
get information like weather and stuff
that will really affect them and help
them make their own lives better
really so and Google execs have said at
least two different times that I can
think of in recent months that it's time
to reach the next five or six billion
people you know I mean there's you know
Google services might cover a lot of
people in the world but in the grand
scheme of things there's still five or
six billion people that you know Google
can still reach with a service or two
then and that you know that's really
what I think Project loon is is really
about I mean look at you know places you
know you know China or India that we
were talking about with you Android
nation I mean you know in Africa there's
so many people in these places compared
to you know compared to Europe or United
States and there's a lot of potential
for Google well these are our emerging
markets no absolutely and I think that
Google is really really trying to focus
on places that just flat-out don't have
any access or have such sparse
population densities that there's no
real no realistic way that anybody's
gonna build terrestrial infrastructure
to service the people in that area
there's some African officials they're
kind of pushing back against it saying
oh yeah this sounds nice but
realistically network access isn't the
problem for the people in those
countries capable devices is the problem
it's not that they can't find a place to
get Wi-Fi it's that they don't have a
laptop or a cell phone that can use the
Wi-Fi so really projecting 3G everywhere
is nice but there's already cell phone
towers to do that there just aren't any
cell phones so I mean it's definitely as
its detractors but I think they're right
in their goal of trying
get everybody on line and I think you're
right in the if they need to focus on
other markets as bigger forces the US is
in world economics half the world's
people live in Africa so you gotta go
over the people are yeah alright in just
real quick news about some some former
HTC execs and they'll get on to some
devices remember over the past month or
so there's been a few execs that have
left
HTC you know bleeding and from the ranks
above and people were you know crying
wolf talking about how well you know HTC
is going downhill cuz execs are leaving
we're not going to talk about that
because you know frankly you know it is
it is what it is but we will talk about
what some of those execs are doing now
that they're not with HTC they're they
started a company called Kazaam yes
that's what it's called and we don't
really have a lot of details yet except
for that it's coming soon and that
they're gonna heavily focus on the
european market focus on solid design
good hardware you know good technology
which you know really should be the goal
of any smartphone company there is no
announcement what software these devices
are going to run you know I'd like to
see him run Android obviously this is
Android authority on air but you know
there's other open mobile OS is out
there so who knows what they're gonna
run I guess we'll Firefox yeah they can
be running Firefox we'll find out soon
enough though and hey it's interesting
you know to see what they do you know
it's always nice to get another
competitor out there consumers generally
win when there's more competition the
way it's bugging me go meat goes Tysons
alright so so let's talk about some some
devices John you want to enlighten us
with some device news around the world
heard Samsung get some cool stuff today
really a lot of devices this week but
the first one is not really an upcoming
device yet but it's an IndieGoGo
campaign and it was what was showing off
was the concept of a motorcycle helmet
it's really kind of centering around
having navigation in a way that
motorcyclists can you know really safely
have it it's kind of similar to Google
has its augmented reality and the
displays pretty similar where it
actually project an image in the images
full-color but it's also translucent so
basically what they're proposing is that
the thing is when I have to 3000
milliamp hour batteries you know for a
long battery life on it then you'll have
a microphone for voice control and then
two-year phones no clue if the earphones
allow you to play music back while
you're riding but you never know the
interface is gonna be tailored to be
very minimalist and focused so probably
not gonna be able to play any games or
watch any videos on the go unless you're
you know find a way to unlock the
bootloader it will be Android powered
you know every gyroscope every other
sensor you could imagine they're
proposing that would have LTE and the
maps would be for the entire world and
it would include points of interest
weather traffic information it's not
really some you know it's not just a
bunch of small-time guys doing it it's
also it's already got a lot of backing
it's a russian project that already has
a substantial amount of backing from a
bunch of russian science and their
prized foundations their goal is to
reach $150,000 by July 12th so if you're
interested you could search for it it's
called live map and it's an IndieGoGo
thing is it on Kickstarter the
interesting pitch in a Russian
businessman it's interesting at least
Samsung's keynote today part of the
keynote was that they're kind of
officially announcing devices they've
already officially announced like we're
not going to cover the active and the
zoom and all that but in terms of new
things that they've announced is uh the
galaxy s4 is
becoming in five new colors blue arctic
brown autumn pink Twilight purple Mirage
and red Aurora I'm really kind of
surprised that they announced all five
at once and so staggering them like you
know three weeks apart for a press
conference
oh look we add it in blue archive Arctic
this week
three weeks later ah now it's in pink
Twilight aren't you I did why didn't
they announce these colors you know a
month two months ago this is what pisses
me off so everybody that bought them two
months ago or am I yesterday well
yesterday you can return it okay so if
you bought these devices 30 days plus
ago and you oh wow I want some blue or
purple or whatever the hell they're
calling them now you can't get it why do
manufacturers do this at least I didn't
wait eight months or nine months or
whatever the hell the Nexus 4 was my
varieties are a bit like is it that hard
to to colorize the shell of a device
that it takes weeks and months to
announce I just did that blows my mind
yeah apparently I'm not smart enough to
comprehend this because I don't work for
these manufacturers you can't car
manufacturers don't do this I mean
seriously
hey that's my rant for this week you
know it's good it's definitely you know
one of the things I did with the s3 was
kind of pushed that the covers you know
you had the flip covers and stuff and
that was really your the the way they
were wanting to go as far as your
customer customizing it and the s4 it
has that too but you know they're you
know on in addition you're getting the
you know device if you want to but if
you wanted to turn like a white s4 into
a you know red or something you're
probably gonna see you know
realistically with the
they have the band around it you'll have
a two-tone or you have a flip cover that
you could do red and white and it would
still look good so you know yeah so it's
not too bad on that one just makes you
know getting a white device is probably
your best bet if you want to color
customize because it goes with anything
but the next one of the next things that
they announced was that actually a
Galaxy NX camera and you know people
think about the galaxy camera this is a
you know Android powered version of
their DSLRs and it's a very serious
camera 20 point three megapixel sensor
it has their proprietary lens mount and
it will work with any existing lenses
from they're interchangeable in x-series
as far as the Android software it's
gonna run for TouchWiz on to 4.2.2 it's
got a 720p 4.8 inch display that's got a
1.6 gigs in those quad core and one and
a half gigabytes of RAM 4360 milliamp
hour battery and it's got 16 gigabytes
of on-board storage with a micro SD slot
for expansion like it's a very it looks
like a very impressive you know
professional camera that you could do
you know that's a little bit of
flexibility to it it's not something
you're gonna play around on the software
all day but it would be good to be able
to post social networks and things
directly you know from that especially
with networks like Google+ it's let you
upload in full resolution so it looks
like a very well you know it looks like
a very well designed device for what
it's intended for I think it's a step
above the you know current this dslr's
where you'd have to do so much more
management as far as plugging into you
you know I want to buy a DSLR camera you
know I I keep saying I want to do it you
know I wonder if I should drop the you
know the money for the Samsung nx-1
x-series is you know very professional
on pretty pricey so doesn't get ready to
dump your wallet out but it looks like a
very good camera low if only it came
without
is you can route it and put a custom on
it you know
NX you know Daniel we could put a custom
ROM on it the camera might force closed
for a while you know you know is it and
that's the main function of the day at
least I run a custom wrong this is why I
want them to release a Google edition a
Google edition of VNA throw them least
and ask him that and the next really and
this was probably the one that raised
the most eyebrow is I think was the
teeth cue and it's a 13.3 inch tablet
laptop hybrid that runs both windows 8
and Android it packs an S Pen that I
believe this it works with Microsoft
Office and you can actually pin Android
apps onto the window windows 8 say the
modern UI the Metro desk blasphemy ah
sorts the the hardware itself though
it's a 3200 by 1800 display on a 13.3
inch screen so it clocks in at 275
pixels per inch samsung knows how to
make high density display really on
their android tablets at all but that's
a beast of a display for us yeah
thirteen point three inches that's huge
yeah it has a their advertising is
having five modes being a it's a
convertible
a tablet a stand you know for typing
floating and writing with the pen the
cpu interestingly that kind of mounts on
a hinge it has you know you have the
keyboard and it will talk down to the
tablet but the the processor is actually
built into the hinge and they tell you
that you know because of that the
processors not want to heat the keyboard
up while you're using it
but you can the hinge kind of comes if
this is your keyboard the hinge kind of
comes out right here and the screen can
float where you can have it like a stand
if you're standing up and typing you can
move it you know tilt it back this way
if you want to demonstrate something you
can tilt it like a laptop or you can use
it like a tablet
it's kind of a better proposition as far
as how many modes and has they kind of
you know every Windows 8 thing that
hybrids have been kind of quirky but it
actually looks useful you know the
keyboards not so small that you wouldn't
want to use it and it's actually a real
keyboard so it doesn't look pretty
impressive yeah it's a hassle beast the
whole I can't I can't get past that John
the whole dual OS mode I mean it's kind
of what are the you use cases for that
not not what you would think and that's
one thing I would say that a lot of the
reviews I saw if you're gonna buy this
thing don't buy it for Android buy it
for Windows because Android if you look
at the Asus trio with the transformer
trio the way the Asus does it is when
you dock it it's in Windows 8 but when
you undock it it's just a full-blown
Android tablet is not trying to be two
different things at the same time that's
what one would actually call dual OS
yeah and all of Android and all of
Windows on top of that this actually has
a dedicated Intel Atom processor to
Android and it has a separate processor
what this one does it actually emulates
Android on top of the current hardware
which is it's got good hardware but
you're in Android all of the windows 8
the charms bar that slides in from the
gesture is actually you can still do the
charms bar that's not like Android so if
your if your finger rolls over it's
going to you know it's gonna be kind of
disjointed yeah that's because you
aren't really in Android you're in
Windows with a full screen view of
Android on top yeah you're just
virtualizing it amazing which I guess if
it was Windows RT I could understand it
more but you got a full-blown version of
Windows 8 I just don't see as much of a
need to dual boot in Android because
you're gonna manage Android devices from
it yeah I I don't see the use of that if
you're blending full-blown desktop
operating system why do you want the
Android yeah I don't need that much more
convenient for me to use some Android
application that it is
use the desktop equivalent or the
browsers it's gonna work better
yeah and it's in in any way shape it's a
very impressive windows
you know hybrid just by itself but if
you're gonna buy one don't buy it for
the Android point buy it through the
windows part alright so let's talk about
devices you would buy it's for Android
that's uh
so anybody interested in the shield uh
you know the Nvidia shield John Dan you
guys interested now though you know I
have a Kepler GPU in my desktop but I'm
still kind of debating on this field
whether I well it's supposed to launch
here in a week actually on June 27th and
the price the price dropped to something
a little more reasonable it's down to
$2.99 now so if you're looking at buying
the shield to do some Android gaming
you'll be happy to know it's only 300
bucks now it's you know the positioning
device don't get me wrong I I'm not a
big Android gamer or a console gamer so
it's not for me but you know there's a
lot of people that are in love with this
thing and can't wait for it
so always everybody's everybody's
favorite well there's a lot of I guess I
won't say that because ZTE
falls in that category anyways Huawei
from from China is one of the more
prominent Chinese handset device
manufacturers they announced their their
first you know flagship and I don't know
I like that term but whatever that's
what they called it their first flagship
device the Ascend p6 it's almost all
metal build pretty decently thin six six
millimeters there's no LTE but if you
look at the market that it's in that
really you know there's there's also no
LTE in China you know that makes sense
yeah the China doesn't have that so
that's fine you don't need to look at it
and think oh my god no LTE you know
that's their market it the battery is a
little small 2000 milliamp hours it's
gonna have a 1.5 gigahertz quad-core
of an unknown type that the processor
hasn't been announced yet which is a
little bit interesting two gigs of RAM
eight gig storage it but there's an SD
slot so you can go ahead and increase
that if you need to it's gonna be rockin
Android 4.2.2 with a heavily modified UI
there emotion UI so well what's emotion
UI if you've ever run me UI or mi UI
depending on what school you're from it
it looks like that you know it is that I
mean it's it's very very very close when
I first saw it at CES last year and then
their video they released this past week
the first thing that came to mind both
times when I saw was hey look it's me
why I mean it really reminds me of that
Dan used to be big into me you I do you
think their emotion you I remind you of
that of are am I crazy I haven't
actually seen it I've seen I've only
really seen a couple of screenshots of
that Huawei
yeah it does look very much for along
the same lines realistically I think
that's just kind of the look but it's
but it well yeah exactly where's me you
are from I mean amazing China's Iommi's
in China and ZTE the other other big
smartphone manufacturer from China their
UI looks similar to this as well they
all they all share the same you know
same look and feel and that's cool you
know you gotta go with what your users
want all right so my favorite phone in
the world the htc droid DNA also known
as the HTC butterfly it's not my
favorite phone if you know who I am but
it is the phone I use every day it's it
it's getting a an upgrade a a
replacement in the soon realm you know
we don't know how soon but it was a it
was announced or teased the butterfly s
which is like I said it's the same
same phone as the Droid DNA just
depending on where you buy if you buy
the United States from Verizon it's
called the Droid DNA go to Japan and you
buy it it's called the butterfly so the
butterfly s was announced and it's it
basically looks like the HTC One got
busy with the butterfly and they had a
love child and the love child was the
butterfly s so it's gonna have a 5-inch
display just like the original butterfly
with 1080p so we have the same processor
that the HTC one has a Snapdragon 600
but like I said it's going to be a
5-inch screen so you're gonna have a
5-inch screen with an awesome processor
16 gig of one board storage just like
the current one the current s9 yeah one
more time
the current butterfly but the butterfly
ass is gonna have an SD slot it's gonna
have two gigs of RAM and just like the
one it's gonna have an ultra pixel
camera and it has front-facing speakers
for boom sound boom and it's gonna rock
a 3200 milliamp hour battery which
that's big and that's I wish the DNA had
that in it so I'm confused because HTC
is only putting out the HTC One this
year and the kind of like how they're
not focusing on low-end markets while
pedaling the desire yes yeah they're
they're they're they're only putting out
the one they're only focusing on the one
all wait a sec what about the one mini
what about the the low-end crappy desire
and we're now good max or the butterfly
ass now the butterfly is Verizon yeah so
I want as a DNA owner I want this phone
and I wish my phone was this fat but I'm
curious that it's not going to have a
Snapdragon 800 because new phones being
announced right now are being announced
with the Snapdragon 800 so I'm curious
to eat either this phone is going to
come out very very soon or it's gonna
come out everyone's maybe like oh I
using that when the new would you know
this is the new thing to use so I would
bet it we're gonna see it soon just for
the fact that it's a 600 what do you
guys think no I think that's I think
that's accurate I think they've probably
been planning to release this for a
while and it's just getting announced
now yeah it's really focused on Asian
markets anyway so yeah it kind of makes
sense that it's a pretty small market
release I mean it's never going to have
LTE onboard so they clearly aren't
trying to go gangbusters with this and
that doesn't you know that doesn't mean
that they're not gonna add in the future
for you know who knows what they're
planning on doing with it I'm still
confused it all these other devices are
coming out because HTC said you know six
months ago they're only focusing on
their flagship so I don't know what this
is anyway so let's speak of that
snapdragon 800 that the butterfly s
doesn't have Dan tell us how awesome
that processor is because I saw some
benchmarks yesterday and I'm still
excited over I can't contain myself
yeah the benchmarks for it are pretty
impressive we were finally able to get
some realistic benchmarks out of it
because Qualcomm invited an an tech and
gadget a couple of other big
publications
Ars Technica I think as well how to
really show it off and show off their
development platform so they gave the
press a tablet and phone running on the
Snapdragon 800 and basically let them
have their way with the devices and so
an tech and and our stack could really
put the devices through their paces and
clogged him against the nvidia tegra for
reference tablets clocked him against
the nexus 10 for the 5055 20 and the
ipad 4 that's the the Apple a6x their
top align processor and really the
snapdragon is quite a strong performer
in some of the more processor intensive
tests it's still losing out a little bit
to the a-15 in terms of per core we're
all processing power
but it's really narrow the gap down top
almost but weird it's really just
blowing away the competition is in GPU
performance and honestly that's kind of
unexpected for Qualcomm they don't
typically make the best of GPUs ever but
the GPUs the GPU in this is the entry no
330 which is a substantial improvement
over the 320 that's in the 600 and when
I say substantial heavy a Miss scores on
the order of double the performance of
the previous generation challenge so
absolutely blowing away every other
Android chip maker out there giving the
the power VR the chips that are in the
Apple a6 series run for its money in
terms of just raw performance and then
in terms of like game simulations from
real world use performance is handling
beating out those devices so this GPU is
really by far the best on the market
right now
nuts yeah and in tech even put it up
against Intel and Andy just top level
graphics processors and it's I mean it's
still losing to those definitely but
it's starting to close the gap between
arm and the desktop or between arm and
x86 graphics processor so this is really
the chip to meet the tiger for is not
even out yet and it's already looking
sad and decrepit unfortunately for
NVIDIA but they have started to talk
about potentially just licensing their
GPU architecture to the arm market so
maybe that's their way yeah I saw that
that's interesting it's almost like
conceding before they even had a chance
to fight yeah well they tried the
fighting and it hasn't been going so
well yeah the Snapdragon 800 you mention
is in all the best things that are in
the pipeline it's been announced or
rumored for the next generation Optimus
G presumably to Qualcomm was there to
announce the device with LG that's also
an announced aureus rumored for a Galaxy
S
or version with lte-advanced for Korea
the lte-advanced there is key because
that is on dye with the 800 and so all
of these devices that have Snapdragon
800 will support LTE advanced even if
your carrier doesn't have LTE advanced
your device is ready for it so it's
definitely good for future proofing
Europe your hands on other devices
rumored to have it are the Samsung
Galaxy Note 3 the HTC One Maxx or g6
which is their upcoming Note competitor
and the Estonia Xperia Z ultra or Z you
are to garden which i think is also
their no competitor so all the most
massive phones on the market are going
to have the most your beefy processor
market now let's get to our secret
contest code in honor of these
Snapdragon 800 the code for this week is
going to be snap dragon sorry so for
those of you that are just tuning in or
missed the beginning here I'm gonna give
a brief recap so what a Dan just but
what was Dan talking about all right so
we're giving away a galaxy note 8.0 the
official contest is gonna be announced
tomorrow but because you love us and we
love you we're giving you an extra
opportunity so what you want to do is
write down that secret code that Dan
just mentioned Snapdragon and put a
little piece of paper put it in notepad
save it somewhere Google keep I don't
care where you save it remember it and
then tomorrow Friday
whenever the contest officially starts
you're gonna go to the contest page
there's going to be a Rafflecopter entry
form
you're gonna put that secret code where
it says android authority on air week
one code and you're gonna put that code
in there and then because you love us
and we love you you're gonna watch on or
less and next week and you're gonna get
a totally different code and you're
gonna enter that code in there that's
gonna give you 2 exclusive android
authority on air chances to win that
some people won't get so you know I like
those odds for a Galaxy Note 8.0
International
shipping as well if you have a
International shipping address if your
mail carrier can get to you you have an
opportunity to win all right so so let's
uh let's talk about what we're talking
about next Oh
Dan's gonna talk about some care your
news and and some device updates and
then that will take a question here from
the audience
sure so T no t-mobile announced that
they are gonna be selling the Sony
Xperia Z later this summer the exact
date and pricing are still a little bit
up in the air which is kind of sad so
the device isn't exactly new anymore but
you know it's finally coming to t-mobile
if you've been waiting for the Xperia Z
soon will be your time Sony is also
pushing 4.2.2 to the Xperia Z L which
makes it the first non Nexus device to
get updated to 4.2.2 rather than just
ship with it so definitely good for Sony
they're updating don't we wish everybody
else would do the same thing in addition
to just the regular basic Android
goodies they are also getting support
for 64 mega Giga Byte excuse me 64
gigabyte microSD cards so if you have
one of those I think they're called X HD
something along those lines super extra
high capacity SD card the FBX yeah
something like that
if you have one of those here Sony
Xperia Z out of now supported in other
carrier news there's been a lot of
entertaining drama between Sprint
Clearwire dish and Softbank going on
last week we talked about how clear
wires board was recommending they accept
dishes much better offer than Sprint's
sprint meanwhile rebuffed dishes buyout
offer for them sued dish over there bit
unclear wire and up to their own bid on
clear wire - better than dishes and now
clear wire is recommending - that their
shareholders side with Sprint Oh
is kind of getting left out in the cold
you're looking like they're not gonna
get anything sprint is poised to accept
softbank's view and clothes on buying
out the rest of clear liner though for a
lot more money than they wanted have to
pay for so Derek how about some updates
for the region all right before we hit
the hit app update so we have a comment
from from YouTube saying Derek are you
still excited about the Moto X with the
rumored leaked specs and just as a
refresher if you don't pay attention to
leaks earlier this week evie leaks famed
smartphone insider that pretty much
leaks leaks a lot of stuff I don't know
how he gets his information but he's
generally more right than not he says
the Moto X will be a 1.7 gigahertz
dual-core processor and MSM 8960 Pro 7
excuse me Dan if it's pro it's gonna be
a quad core ok I'm just reading what he
said
720p 2 gigs of ram 16 gig of storage 10
megapixel camera in the front I'm sorry
and the rear the front camera is gonna
be 2 megapixel it's gonna run Android
4.2.2 so Dan you're saying if it's an
MSM 8960 Pro that's actually a quad core
another dual core like he be leaked said
well if it's a Snapdragon s4 pro then
it's a quad core if it's pin 8960 as
opposed to the 8960 a then it's a dual
core and not a-- for
its using a processor that's a year old
well it's either using one that's a year
old or one that's a year a hassled ok so
you know phones are fast enough so I
looked the processor and I say yeah ok
whatever
but then I look at that 720p and then I
go back to previous rumors where was
either a 4.3 inch screen or a 4.7 inch
screen
then I died a little bit inside because
I need five inches and I need to be
1080p the DNA as much as I hate that
damn thing I love that screen and I need
a phone with a big screen and a big
display but this what if this isn't the
flagship and what if it's the razor him
successor but that would be a beast of a
phone at mid-range so yes oh so i'm i
don't know i really wanted motorola to
step up and save the day
um i'll gonna keep my fingers crossed
and confidence high that they're still
gonna do that for me instead of
releasing a film with a year-plus old
SOC system-on-chip they might surprise
us or this phone could come out and be
you know you've got to remember the
Nexus 4 sold for $300 and it had that
part you know the same or similar
processor in it so maybe this phone will
sell for 150 bucks I don't know you know
maybe they're gonna do something with
the price it's gonna allow us who knows
I want to be wowed I want Motorola to
WoW me and I'm still hopeful I don't
know if those specs are real I don't
know if I'm gonna buy it I I don't know
all right so so let's uh yeah there's an
another user comment or question here
about the giveaway is there a space in
Snapdragon no there is not as and you
know what um if you happen to mess up
and put a space and Snapdragon for that
secret code that's fine
the winner will be checked to make sure
you know that that that they they
entered the code and and when it
whenever chances go down through to be
honest with you I'll go and spill the
beans
it's just gonna see if there's text in
the field so if you put something that
isn't correct in there like scott
anderson never makes his bed calm then
it's still gonna count as a entry but
then when I look at it and I don't see
Snapdragon in there I
take it out manually so you can you can
spell it as horrible as you want and as
long as I basically look at it and say
hey they're trying to spell Snapdragon
it'll be a pain that I have to go
through for you guys and I have to
manually check all the entries I will go
through that pain for you cuz I'm I'm
just that dedicated all right so so back
to apps so OH
Verizon so instead of releasing an
Android update for every phone they have
except for the Galaxy Nexus because it's
already on 4.2.2 instead of releasing
Android updates for every phone except
for one they decide to give us what we
really wanted and that is a game
Verizon reactivated their droid landing
Twitter account they haven't used it
since last November when they announced
that the Razr m and all the other stuff
so let's see it down personally so
everybody's like oh my god to reactivate
the account we're gonna get a new droid
device I hate that name and then they're
like Moo ha ha ha ha we're not releasing
a new device we're releasing a game
instead you know we spent time and money
on this game
who cares about Android OS updates more
blood we're you know yes this is what
your overpriced phone bill pays for not
phone service all of this crap you
didn't want in the first place all right
so so what exactly is is this game so
it's called decom droid combat also
available for iPhone so it's not just
exclusive to to risings droid tones
droid come on iPhone seriously you can
install it on your iPhone if you go to
Verizon's website they link directly to
the Google Play Store and the Apple App
Store it's it's kind of Awesome there's
Nexus for them yeah it does oh yeah
because that's the Nexus the Nexus or
the devil alright so so what this game
is it's an augmented reality game sounds
kind of cool right so basically you're
uh you're a mech you know if you
remember what mecha Warriors are yeah
that's really what it is you're
50 foot tall walking flying tank and you
swipe and you tap over your phone to
fire and block missiles it the game's
free so you don't try it but there is
in-app purchases to make your to make
your character more bad way so you can
spend more money on Verizon if you did
you'd be quiet' if you buy more missiles
for your mech they will use that money
for software development and update your
Android device to mcgary
ok so moving on with besides things that
make me sad actually know this makes me
sad too this is a sad week for for app
updates so Falcon Pro it is a very
popular Twitter client a lot of people
use it I don't use Twitter that much but
I use Falcon Pro when I do when I do get
on the Twitter the the developer
remember a few months back he ran into
some issues were it became so popular
that it hit the 100 thousand account API
token limit Twitter limits third-party
apps so their app stays the most popular
anyways it hit a hundred thousand so he
said well we're gonna reset these tokens
so people that pirated the app people
that don't use the app anymore it's
going to release their tokens and give
you a chance to you know real legitimate
users that want to use it to continue
using it he did that and all was
hunky-dory for a while and then he
started releasing new updates adding
multiple accounts so people could add
multiple accounts but you know what
those multiple counts they pull in new
tokens to to kind of shot himself in the
foot by adding multiple counts support
and they hit the hundred thousand API
limit again so he says alright we're
gonna reset everything so he resets
everything people start logging back in
all is fine and well and then boom he
kind of gets shut down Twitter basically
says no no I don't really know exactly
what's going on the app has been pulled
from the Google Play Store and if you
already have a token on there you can go
ahead and use the
but the future looks pretty grim for for
Falcon Pro at this point I what do you
think John I I don't think it's
sustainable
I mean it's unfortunate it's not the
developers fault it's yeah it's
Twitter's business model I respect that
he wants to support customers that you
know basically supported him you know I
understand that he wants to fight you
know every way he can to try to keep his
at Boeing because these people gave him
money you know for our product but you
know at some point you just gotta
realize how it's just not sustainable
anymore it's not worth fighting this is
a mess Twitter being a douche but so ya
know all sorts of other app updates you
know Netflix updated chrome updated we
talked about Instagram earlier Instagram
has an update you know asana got an
update all sorts of apps those I know a
lot of people use Spotify so we'll talk
about that a little more in depth
Spotify you know finally got updated to
use notification toggles you know those
those things that are awesome and
jellybean they allow you to control apps
you know from from the notification area
so Spotify now allows you to do that you
know and some people are saying oh hey
you know it's about time you know jelly
beans only been available for a year so
it's about time Spotify supported this
and in you know I think that Google Play
Music you know is shaking up the
industry and and Spotify is like well
we're not the only you know kid in town
anymore so we better do what we can to
spruce things up and they've been doing
that you know the last updated landscape
mode so that and that had been missing
for like years
ya know yeah dirt you know and that's
good so if your Spotify user that's good
now you're getting updates me I'm a
Google Play Music all access user and I
couldn't be happier I paid my $7.99 last
week or two weeks ago whenever that was
last drop in the Hat and I mean what
that analogy means but apparently people
say that when in this situation
alright so Dan you want to yell about
some patents yes intellectual adventures
which
you may remember is a control to use the
president's term for them I know that's
a great that he actually calls them that
yes yes not a patent asserting entity
and intellectual adventures you might
also remember as a front for Nokia also
known as a front for Microsoft has sued
Motorola or you know Google in Florida
never mind the fact that they already
have an ongoing litigation against
Motorola in some other state they filed
a totally separate suit rather than
joining it together just so it would be
more paperwork and more costly for
Google to defend themselves and the
patent that they're claiming Motorola is
infringing has to do with linking URLs
in emails yes seriously
as in pasting a URL into your email
client and then when you hit Send having
it render like as a clickable URL which
in fact is just the default way that
HTML functions I really hope that now
that you know the United States
government realizes that patents are
hurting and in hindering software
development now that things like this
hope will hopefully things like this in
the future can't actually be a real
thing because the fact this is a real
thing saddens me almost as much as you
know patenting a shape yes yeah I mean
Microsoft is seriously suing Google and
claiming that they own a certain way
that the internet functions for
everybody
anytime you ever type a URL into an
email and press send you are violating
this patent according to intellectual
Ventures that sounds like a fair use you
know patent ban you know it's a standard
thing about this is that this patent was
ever granted seriously the US Patent and
Trade Office should feel embarrassed
that crap like this went through their
office and came out with their seal of
approval
it's pathetic clicking on a link in a
URL is not something that you can patent
particularly not when it's already part
of the HTML standard that is open to
everybody it's really just ridiculous
all right well dan do you have anything
else to add we didn't cover this week no
that was really the only big patent news
that was Android related this one
current John how about you any anything
we didn't hit on you want to yak about
first a few seconds pretty much covered
this very humourous with him like
Microsoft and Nokia how Microsoft almost
boat bought Nokia but they've degraded
Nokia so much by running Windows Phone
ok has no value for them to justify
buying them as a mobile division well I
look forward to the news coming up next
week because this week this week was a
slow news week in my opinion yeah there
was a couple of big things in the news
to talk about but it's a little slow and
I'd like to talk about a report Android
news so let's hope that next week is
exciting you know we're getting close to
the end of January a week from now will
be the end of our galaxy note 8 giveaway
so we'll be able to talk about that and
more importantly a week from now is the
two-year anniversary of Google+ so go
ahead and start your conspiracy theories
and rumor engines now about what cool
thing what awesome feature will Google
roll out in a in a week and also
coincidentally the Nexus 7 pre-order
becomes a year old in a week so maybe
the Nexus 7 to then updated Nexus 7 the
Refresh the reboot the newbie whatever
you want to call it please don't call
the Nexus 8 you know baby will have
maybe where we had a report on that in a
week because it'll be it'll be a thing I
want it to be a thing
one order one I will order one all right
so you can find us on Android authority
calm if you're watching this on YouTube
now hey that's where you can find us
youtube.com slash Android authority
Google Plus Android Authority
facebook.com slash Android thority
Android off on Twitter Android authority
on Soundcloud or also on iTunes
we're also on the Miro and current
Google Currents we have our app in the
Google Play Store where you can stay up
to date and be notified every time we
publish an article all sorts of stuff so
check us out tune in next week for an
additional chance to win a Galaxy Note 8
and if you fast forward it to the end
hoping to get that secret code nope it's
hidden somewhere in the middle of the
show you have to watch everything that
