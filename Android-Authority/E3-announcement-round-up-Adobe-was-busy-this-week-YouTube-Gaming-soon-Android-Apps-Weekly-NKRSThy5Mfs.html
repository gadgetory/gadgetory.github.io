show is brought to you by Galaxy
universal remote hello again ladies and
gentlemen I'm Joe Hindy the android
authority app guy and welcome back to
android apps weekly this week we're
going to check out a whole bunch of e3
stuff Zynga announced a new strategy
game called dawn of titans and let me
tell you this game looks mighty
impressive it features some really good
graphics and some decent mechanics that
should equal up to a fun time we don't
have a release date yet and here's
hoping Zynga doesn't wreck it with
ridiculously bad in-app purchases Square
Enix fans in particular have a lot to be
excited about because the company not
only announced a Final Fantasy 7 remake
for the ps4 but that final fantasy 7 was
coming to mobile the iOS version is due
out sometime this year and Android will
be along eventually while we're on the
topic of Square Enix they also announced
Kingdom Hearts Unchained key for mobile
it takes place during the same stretch
of story that the more recent kingdom
hearts games do and it has a lot of the
same mechanics even if the graphics
don't look as good as the console
versions Square Enix also included an
announcement for Laura Croft go which is
an action adventure puzzle game along
the same vein as hitman go but during
the announcement they also alluded to
some Monument Valley style elements like
a more calm experience we don't have a
release date for this one either but it
does look like a lot of fun EMU has
announced that they'll be porting the
classic 2006 pc game titan quest to
android later this year for those who
don't know titan quest is a fighting
game where you play historically
significant figures as you battle evil
mythological creatures it should be out
sometime this year the EA has announced
that they'll be releasing a build
harvest game called minions paradise
this will likely coincide with the
release of the minions movie that's due
out in theaters next month if you've
played games like ice age village or
nemo's reef you pretty much know what's
going on with this title along with that
EA announced a card collecting RPG
called Star Wars galaxy of Heroes as
with any card collecting game you'll be
collecting cards of iconic characters
ships etc from all of the movies and
you'll be using them to make your deck
stronger it's slated to be released
later this year but fez de had quite a
year at e3 for mobile gaming as well
they announced that they'll be bringing
a simulation game called fallout shelter
while you'll get to control people's
lives build various places like gyms and
bars and otherwise manage the law
lives of some people fall out style it's
out for iOS now with an android version
coming eventually Bethesda also
announced a card collecting game called
the Elder Scrolls legends that is due
out sometime this year if you've played
har stone before then you pretty much
know what this game is all about it has
a similar premise but it takes place in
the Elder Scrolls universe instead of
the warcraft universe the telltale games
makers of the popular walking dead
series games have announced a miniseries
called the walking dead michonne this
covers the story of Michonne from issue
126 through issue 139 of the comic book
series which hasn't been covered in any
of the other games or the TV series this
one is coming to mobile but also to
console and PC so you can play it
wherever you want starbreeze studios has
announced it we bringing the payday
franchise to android for those who don't
know payday is a moderately popular
first-person shooter that was originally
launched back in 2011 for PC and the
PlayStation 3 they're working on
developing a mobile friendly version of
it and we have no idea when it will be
out a new torchlight game was also
announced this week called torchlight
mobile this is an action RPG title
similar to Diablo and the torchlight
franchise has done well on PC in the
past we don't have a release date yet
but it is coming sometime this year
gameloft today busy III as they
announced a few new games but most
notably siege fall siege fall is for a
lack of a better term a clash of clans
clone it has some decent graphics heroes
and a much longer campaign mode it uses
gems to upgrade stuff faster using
in-app purchases if you really want to
use them and finally we're back to EA
they showed off their upcoming FIFA 2016
title which we anticipate will be as
popular as d 2015 and 2014 variants it
has some decent graphics and controls
much like its predecessors it will also
most likely be free with in-app
purchases similar to the earlier titles
be prepared for that one this summer for
more information you can find links to
all of these stories in our master list
where we round up all the videos and
news from e3 this last week since I do
make this on Thursday there are likely
some smaller announcements that I didn't
get to in the video so it's worth
checking out you can find that link in
the video description below now let's
get to some regular headlines from the
last week let's pass had a security
breach this last week that prompted the
company to encourage everyone to change
their master passwords we understand
that it wasn't a May
reach with no important information
getting leaked and that the password
change is really just a precaution a new
Humble Bundle was released this last
week it features eight games with more
coming soon if you pay the minimum one
dollar you will get four of the games
and if you beat the average you'll get
every single game available in the
bundle as usual it's a great way to give
to charity and try out some awesome new
games in an effort to promote its new
family-friendly section the google play
store is now offering a free app of the
day unfortunately it's only in the
family-friendly section of applications
which only affects those who use that
section but it is still a fun little
promotion we've known for a while now
that Cortana is coming to android but we
didn't know quite when Microsoft has
announced that a beta version will be
showing up this July we'll have more
details when they become available in
our last headline this week YouTube will
be taking on twitch with its YouTube
gaming platform which is set to release
sometime this summer some folks at ARS
technica got to take a look at it early
and it seems to look pretty nice and
we'll know more when it gets released
this summer for even more headlines app
updates and new releases don't forget to
check out this week's newsletter which
is linked in the video description below
there will have all the content we
didn't have time for here in this video
if you want you can sign up with your
email address and get all of the stuff
since streets your inbox every single
Friday ok folks let's take a look at the
apps and games that made a big splash
this week moments is a new application
from Facebook that is kind of a direct
response to google photos using the
service you can back up all of your
photos in one place and then you can
share them to facebook instagram or
facebook messenger you can sync multiple
photos use the photo search feature and
even save photos that other people send
you it doesn't google photos but it is a
fun option for those who primarily use
instagram or facebook shoot is an
application by BitTorrent that allows
you to share files between android
devices here's how it works the device
with the file will create a QR code the
other device will scan it and then a
connection will be made and the file
will be downloaded it's very easy to use
and to understand once you get in there
and actually use the application it's
also totally free to use but beware of
those release day bugs cloud player by
double twist is a new music player that
does something quite unique it can
connect to your cloud storage account
such as Dropbox Google Drive and others
to play music that is stored there this
essentially turns your cloud storage
into your music player in a way that
very few applications have been able to
accomplish it also enjoys airplay
chromecast support a 10 band EQ and
material design the portal is another
file transfer application but this one
was developed by push bullets the aim is
to simplify the process of transferring
files from your computer to your Android
device and back again it allows you to
transfer multiple files and even entire
folders at once you can include photos
videos documents and more the only
caveat is you'll need a device running
Android 5.0 lollipop or later in order
to use the app earlier this week adobe
released not one but four applications
to the Google Play Store they include
Photoshop mix shape CC brush CC and
Colour CC Photoshop mix is a light photo
editing application with a slew of
editing options shape CC takes the
images of things and turns them into
vector graphics fresh CC does the same
thing but instead turns them into
brushes for later use and Colour CC
helps you determine what color things
are in photos they are all potentially
useful tools and they are all free to
use in the google play store right now
the galaxy universal remote application
is one of the better remote apps
available on the Google Play Store it
uses the devices built-in IR blaster to
control your TV set-top box media
streamer and even your camera if you
have a supported DSLR it features a
smooth easy to use interface with a
bucket load of supported devices and you
can get a device supported upon request
there's also Android wear supports you
can control all of these devices using
your SmartWatch as well the only caveat
is you'll need a phone with an IR
blaster we'd like to thank the
developers of galaxy universal remote
