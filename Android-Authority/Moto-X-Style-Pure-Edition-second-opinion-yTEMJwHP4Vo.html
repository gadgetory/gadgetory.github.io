reasons for being excited over a new
Moto X it might be the model maker it
might be the customization that it
allows you to have the somewhat Nexus
like experience or it just might be the
different features that it can provide
compared to the rest now that last one
is something that wasn't true for the
last couple of iterations but this year
we have a moto X that is trying to
provide more than plenty of the other
flagship smartphones out there and if
you haven't seen the launch great review
of the Moto X of which he had a lot of
great things to say you can click on
over into the corner up there so you can
watch and read his review but what I'm
doing right now is providing you my
opinion on what has been a pretty good
experience with the Moto X it stretch of
regard from Android authority what's
going on everybody and these are my
second opinions on the Moto X now I will
say that pretty much everything about
the Moto X returns here with its general
shape even the dimple on the back even
though it's a lot smaller this time
around and the singular bar right here
is a kind of a welcome change I did like
the larger dimple but this isn't so bad
either the actual size of the phone is
actually a little bit thicker than
before which I'll get into a little bit
later as it has to do with the handling
and I will say that when you use the
white version like this you still get
the two blemishes down here these are of
course the motion sensor so that you can
use the Moto display very easily by just
waving your hand over the device like I
am right now the problem with the bamboo
and the backing however is that it does
provide a very slippery touch and that's
true about the metal chassis all around
if you don't get that sort of rubberized
plastic that long had in his review then
you don't really get any benefits of
grip on here and that's my biggest issue
with this particular phone it's the fact
I'd had five point seven inches in the
screen it's actually just that little
bit too hard to handle in one hand it's
not impossible let's put it that way the
curve on the back is still able to make
a dress pretty nicely in the hand but
still I'm not all that happy with the
handling experience when I've already
dropped this phone on my face a few
times to be honest and when I'm
constantly trying to balance it with my
pinkie here on the bottom it's easy to
sort of topple over from side to side
that's really my only big issue with it
and I know I did not really help the
situation by getting a slippery backing
but if you're going to have a phone
that's this large and you get a slippery
back you should
just know that handling on here is not
all that it's cracked up to be as I move
into the display I actually think that
this LCD is performing well enough that
I'm not truly missing AMOLED yes I do
wish that AMOLED was on here because I'm
used to that particular color profile
but at least Motorola I give them credit
for this has been able to put in a good
enough level of saturation on here that
really it's just remained a pretty good
experience and of course we have quad HD
resolution in this 5.7 inch display so
everything from work and play has been
very enjoyable on here especially video
gaming which I've done quite a bit of on
this particular device even if the
overall size and thus handling of the
device has been detracted from just a
little bit at least I've had a good time
just looking at everything playing
everything watching everything on this
pretty good display which brings us into
performance and I guess I have to
highlight mostly that media consumption
has been awesome on here not even
mentioning the front-facing speakers
just yet we're saving that for the
hardware section i've already had a good
time just having media in the background
while i'm looking up stuff on let's say
chrome and pretty much doing anything
else that i wanted to on here this is
what a typical day might look like for
me i'm not only browsing on chrome i'm
also listening to podcasts i'm watching
HBO now which has been amazing recently
i might add and there are even some
other things like going on twitter or
going to the gallery and just
downloading a couple things here and
there that have been very smooth with
this snapdragon 808 I really had no
problems on here and I do have to say
that I might give some of the credit to
what has been a pretty stock like
experience for this Android iteration
here on the Moto X it's really in
hardware though that things actually
start to get mixed up a little bit and
yes that's mostly because of the
expandable storage this little slot on
the top right here is able to house not
only a SIM card but a micro SD card but
it's not just the fact that the Moto X
provides expandable storage it's how a
Moto implemented it that I think is
really great see when you'd use other
phones like a samsung galaxy or even an
apple iphone you tend to find that as
you add storage on to those particular
models you have to really jack up the
price from 16 to 32 to 64 to 128
gigabytes you're gonna be paying a lot
of money just for storage
what moto is reminding everybody right
now is that you can have a very low base
model 16 gigabytes with this one right
here which for us here at Android
authority we do think that 16 gigabyte
base models are a thing of the
but luckily with the Moto X you can save
a little bit of money getting 16
gigabytes and then you can add your own
storage with the expandable SD card slot
sound quality on here is also really
good and yes I'm talking about the
front-facing speakers pretty much from
my games I don't find myself having
headphones on most of the time because
I'm having a good enough time just with
the stereo experience with those two
front facing speakers yes by the end of
the day I am usually afraid that I'm not
going to get back to a charger in time
and I'm going to have a dead phone for
maybe an hour or two before I get back
to my home but if I'm just in my house
or just sort of in places where I'm able
to plug in pretty easily I even have a
fast charging portable battery that's
available if I'm able to just plug it in
for a little bit in the middle of the
day actually those worries about power
kind of go away
now again this is definitely not the way
that we want our battery life to move
forward when it comes to our smartphones
but at the very least fast charging is
kind of a crutch that we can already
pretty much lean on and in camera I do
find that the Moto X has had a very
improved experience with the camera and
that's saying something because if
you've had the Moto X from before then
you really should be checking out the
one right now because the camera while
not one of the best that's out there is
a vast improvement and is able to pretty
much tout that it has the quality that
anyone can have on the daily here are
some pictures that I took during a
weekend out now what I did like about
the Moto X was that I didn't feel like I
needed to have my DSLR all of the time
in order to take some nice pictures so
that was really nice but also the best
part about the camera experience is the
fact that you can get into it so easily
just twist the phone a couple of times
and you're in and ready to go but that
kind of ended there because I really
don't like the application that Motorola
uses for its camera it's not only
lacking in a lot of manual controls but
the way that it expects you to be able
to take photos by tapping on the actual
viewfinder it's just not the way that I
would really like it I want a dedicated
button on the side because if I'm going
to tap on the viewfinder I expect it to
focus on that particular point having to
drag the focus point around is not
necessarily the way that I want to be
able to cater a shot to what I want oh
and speaking of the front-facing camera
yes you do get a flash up there now and
it's now 5 megapixels but unless you're
taking a lot of selfies all the time and
even then if you're in a club all the
time
reason then those might be the only
situations that you might actually use
that flash even then it kind of washes
out the subject too much for them to
even look that great and finally in
software despite not being under the
Google umbrella anymore
motorola is still providing a pretty
nexus like experience with the Moto X
and so you can see here that I've
already catered the phone to my liking
with all of the folders on the bottom I
don't like any extra home screens aside
from Google now on the side and I have
my own custom background on there there
are a couple of additions like mostly
the Moto actions in which contextually
it will be able to know when to change
itself to silent mode for example or you
can use your voice to do certain things
on the phone and of course you have the
phrase that you can customize on here
which is another layer of customization
to the Moto X like with mine hey X
activate I don't get Motorola a lot of
credit because they still are providing
a pretty good phone at a pretty good
price point there may not be the lower
price of the Moto X that we've had
before but then again you're getting a
more premium product especially with the
quad HD display and even more options
inside of the Moto maker so even if
you're going to be paying a certain
amount for the extra features that you
want on here for the most part it's
still cheaper than plenty of the
high-end smartphones that are out there
that don't even provide expandable
storage see that's the thing about the
Moto X it's about choice and that's what
we give Motorola the most credit for and
that's the reason why we gave the Moto X
such high marks and I do have to agree
with lon that despite the small caveats
that I have here I do think that the
Moto X is one of the better offerings
that we have this year in Android so
keep it tuned to Android authority for
even more including our full review of
the Moto X that lawn did and again I've
had it in a link in the corner so if you
haven't seen it already make sure you do
and then you can see all of the content
from my colleagues in Android and
download the Android authority app which
is also up in the corner over there so
you can get access to all of our content
from our written post to our forums to
our Android or D podcasts discussing
topics in Android every single week and
then when you're done with all of that
subscribe to this channel and then head
on over to Android or decom for even
more because we are your source for all
