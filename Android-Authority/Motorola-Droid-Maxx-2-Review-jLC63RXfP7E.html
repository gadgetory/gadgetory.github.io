the Moto X play to be released within
the United States the wait is finally
over
well sorta the Droid Maxx has
desperately been waiting for a refresh
since mid 2013 and this year Motorola
has finally released its successor and
for the most part is in fact a Moto X
play rebranded for Verizon customers
here in the United States hello
everybody I'm crystal and this is a
Droid Maxx - now it's not exactly
identical to the Moto X play but it's
close so let's take an even closer look
to see just how much has changed with
the Droid Maxx - first thing you'll
notice when taking a look at the back of
the phone is that Verizon logo on top of
the Droid logo so yeah just like the
Droid Maxx the Droid Maxx - is a Verizon
exclusive which plays a huge part in
differentiating this phone from the Moto
X play similar to all of these years
Motorola phones we have the camera the
flash and that beloved Motorola dimple
here in the middle house within this
metal frame of course I'd imple acts as
a nice resting point for your finger
while navigating to the phone and it
feels very nice to add even more comfort
to the phone we have a very nice rubbery
material alongside the back it has a
different pattern than we've seen on the
Moto X pure or style and it seems a
little bit more softer to the touch as
well it feels very nice and it gives it
a good grip although it does get dirty
quite easily
now unfortunately moto maker isn't
available here on the Droid Maxx -
unlike its win the Moto X play but you
still are able to remove the backplate
which gives users the freedom of
changing their textures and colors of
their phone flipping the phone to the
front we have a classic Motorola look
the speaker grills that pop out ever so
slightly along with this front-facing
camera now don't be fooled by those
speaker grilles it's easy to assume that
these are dual stereo speakers just like
the pure Edition but the bottom speaker
is the only one that produces sound when
watching media so it can create a little
bit of an awkward and unbalanced
listening experience but we'll take that
front facing speaker over anything else
anytime the quality itself is decent
nowhere near the best but it does offer
some crisp sounds with a good amount of
trouble motorola always manages to put
some very slim bezels around their
phones and the
droid Maxx 2 is no exception which makes
this phone quite easy to hold even with
this big 5.5 inch screen now it's not
much better off some added thickness to
the phone at ten point nine millimeters
and a little weight at 169 grams really
though this phone is one of the grippy s
and most comfortable phones to hold
speaking of that 5.5 inch screen we have
a beautiful HD LCD display on the front
of the Droid Maxx - no it does not
consist of Motorola's shatter proofing
technology found within the phone it was
announced with the Droid turbo - but
with this Gorilla Glass 3 we can't
expect to hold up just as well as most
2015 flat chips although not quite HD
for a mid-range smartphone this HD
display makes sense and it's actually
one of the best HD screens we've seen
this is as good as an HD screen can get
now it's interesting that Motorola
decided to have an LCD screen here
instead of an AMOLED one as one of the
biggest features is moto display which
displays notifications over a black
background but once again with this
phones main selling point being its
price it also makes sense in outdoors
you should have no problem seeing the
screen as it can get pretty bright under
the hood the Droid Maxx 2 packs a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 processor
alongside an Adreno GPU 2 gigs of ram
and although it only comes in 16 gigs of
storage you just have access to a
microSD card slot for up to 128 gigs of
storage on paper the Droid Maxx 2 is
impacting the most powerful processor on
the market and 2 gigs of ram isn't as
much as we're used to seeing these days
but for a mid-range smartphone the Droid
Maxx 2 performs exceptionally well very
smooth and it handles multi testing
without any hesitation for heavy gamers
the drawer max 2 may fall short of your
needs but for the most part it delivers
fast performance one of the most loved
features and Motorola phones is it's
near vanilla Android experience and on
the Droid Maxx 2 we can expect mostly
the same except with some extra Verizon
bloatware so out of the box the Droid
Maxx 2 is running lollipop 5.1.1 which
is a little disappointing as marshmallow
has been out for a while already and
when you buy a new phone you expect to
have a little softer there is a
guaranteed marshmallow update coming out
sometime down the road but with this
being a Verizon exclusive we may have to
wait for a while besides all that this
is probably the best software experience
you can have on a
nothing has been tinkered with you can
expect that same uniform material design
look throughout the phone from the
pulldown menu to the settings and the
recent apps for you and what makes this
a little more appealing than actual
stock Android is Motorola cool features
that can be accessed to their Motor app
which comes pre-installed with the phone
on the Droid Maxx - this moto app offers
less features and you would find on the
Droid turbo or Moto X pure but it's
still worth a look
moto display is here which displays
notifications in a simple icon format
over a black screen it can be triggered
when the phone is slightly moved
although there are no sensors found on
the front so wave your hand over will
not turn the screen on like on other
Motorola devices moto voice is also very
helpful it's similar to an OK Google
command but you can program it to listen
to a specific phrase you set there's
also a gesture like choice to launch a
camera app which is extremely useful
although unfortunately chop to launch a
flashlight is unavailable here the
software itself runs flawlessly no
stutters or choppiness and animations
and switching between apps is a breeze
this goes without being said but the
camera found here on the Droid Maxx 2 is
lightyears ahead of the 2013 Droid Maxx
we have the same 21 megapixel
rear-facing and 5 megapixel front-facing
cameras here as we do on all the other
chosen to Motorola phones photos are
consistently great producing a ton of
detail and colors are nice and vibrant
it does have a tendency to overexpose
sometimes but that's one area where
Motorola's camera interface really helps
because exposure is easily adjustable
although for everything else this
interface can be a little awkward to use
with is drag to focus and tap to shoot
mechanics when you move into lower light
areas quality begins to take a hit of
course like most phones but compared to
other chosen 15 smartphones it seems to
fall a bit behind however that being
said they're definitely not horrible
although there is no optical image
stabilization to help shots from being
blurry the software stabilization found
in video works great and the overall
video quality is beautiful 4k video
recording is also available and does a
fantastic job the front facing five
megapixel camera with this wider angle
lens creates really nice-looking selfie
shots with a good amount of detail as
well overall the cameras on the droid
maxx 2 are the best cameras motorola has
made
and there's a lot to love here one of
the biggest selling points of the Droid
Maxx too is its battery we have a huge
non removable 3630 milliamp hour battery
and along with this more power
conserving HD screen you can expect some
great battery life here it should no
doubt last you an entire day even with
some heavy usage on the moderate use day
of sending a good amount of texts and
browsing the internet for a while we
were able to get over five hours of
screen on time on some days I was only
at around 40% by the time I went to
sleep so with light to moderate use on
the second day you can see the Droid
Maxx too can give you two day battery
life overall very impressive results and
of course the max2
is capable of being charged with
Motorola's turbo charger which is one of
the fastest charges in the market right
now giving you up to eight hours of
usage in just 15 minutes of charge and
yeah unlike the Moto X play The Joy Max
2 does come with that turbo charger now
as this is a verizon phone customers can
purchase this phone for $0 down and $16
per month for 24 months or of course is
full retail price of 384 dollars Verizon
is doing something pretty cool to
allowing users to trade in their old
phone for up to $300 towards the
purchase of the Droid Maxx - so you get
a lot with the Droid Maxx - for a
relatively low price with this great
camera fantastic battery life and a
great software experience is definitely
worth picking up if you happen to be a
Verizon customer well that's about it
