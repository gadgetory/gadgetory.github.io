by Toyota live from the Samsung tech
lounge in the mirage hotel we got our
hands on the smallest of the brand new
tab pro line hey Josh regard from Andrew
authority what's going on everybody and
this is the samsung galaxy tab pro 8.4
today Samsung announced a brand new line
of high-end tablets that essentially
bolsters the entire line of the already
established devices the pro moniker
basically means that the super high
specifications you may have wanted in
your original Galaxy Tab tablets are now
a reality in terms of design Samsung's
seemingly now ubiquitous textured
plastic makes a return as the back takes
on that very nice feel and is a great
upgrade from the old glossy plastic the
8.4 does take on a thin profile that was
originally achieved in the note 10.1
2013 edition and thus not only feels
quite light but is actually pretty grey
pible in one hand the super clear LCD
screen is where much of the improvement
lies as the smaller screen by tablet
standards takes on the very great 2560
by 1600 resolution that gives it an
incredible display experience underneath
the surface the tab pro employs the
powerful Snapdragon 800 for great
performance definitely making pro mean
speed two gigabytes of ram and a 4800
milliamp hour battery help power an
updated TouchWiz interface that further
takes on the my magazine motif that the
note 3 originally introduced tabpro
devices now come with the magazine UI in
which samsung has put in their own
uniquely designed widgets essentially
specialty pages of homescreens can now
be highly customized with different
sized widget tiles that make for a
refreshingly different user experience
it's definitely something that TouchWiz
has needed for quite a while it's clear
that after quite some time residing in
the middle tier market the galaxy tab
pro 8.4 looks to take the tab series
into the high-end market and this 8.4
inch offering takes on the likes of the
LG G pad in the Nexus 7 comparisons on
those will come soon so make sure you
stay tuned once again this is Joshua
ragar from android authority reporting
to you live from the Samsung tech lounge
here at CES 2014 and once again thank
you to Toyota for sponsoring our CES
