device and also coming from a pedigree
that kept things pretty simple the
oneplus 2 actually adds some new
features in this new iteration so we
wanted to take a look at what those
features are and give you our thoughts
on them so it's Josh regard for
management authority what's going on
everybody and this is a look at the new
features that are put into the oneplus 2
now we're going to start off with the
action slider which is found on the left
side and this is one of the main
additions that you see right off the bat
it is a three-stage slider that allows
you to toggle among the different
notification settings in lollipop you
can of course go for all notifications
if you want everything to come in
priority notifications if you start
anybody in your contacts list for
example and then of course have no
notifications which is essentially like
silencing the phone now moving among the
three different stages is actually very
simple and very meaty you'll be able to
find this button very easily if it's in
your pocket which i think is the main
usage of it if you happen to have your
phone in your pocket or it might be just
lying on a table you can easily feel the
textured button on there and slide it
down to the bottom position or the top
position depending on whether you want
to have your phone silenced or not we
then go into the other very obvious
feature that is on the front of the
phone the fingerprint reader now the
fingerprint reader is also the home
button but it's not a button per se it's
just this little area that was carved
out in order to house the actual reader
itself now this is a press type rather
than a swipe type which is always more
preferred and basically what you have to
do is just set up your fingerprint in
the settings and you can do it with up
to five different fingerprints but
mostly you'll be doing it with your
thumbs
once your fingerprints are registered
they can actually wake and unlock the
device even when the device is sleeping
so if you have the device lock so you
just have to rest your finger on that
area and the phone will wake up after
sensing your fingerprint and unlock the
phone directly now my only real caveat
when it comes to the fingerprint reader
down here and also the fact that it is a
home button capacitive wise is the fact
that it's not as sensitive as I would
want it to be now I know that this is
more of a personal issue but when I have
my finger down on there
to completely cover the entire area in
order for it to register all even as a
home button is not necessarily a problem
with the way that it is constructed it
might just be that I need to get used to
hitting the button a little bit
differently but really you have to put
down a little bit of weight on there and
also you have to cover the entire area
and is then that you're going to have a
much more consistent home button and
fingerprint reader the next feature
we're going to cover is one that
actually is a pretty big deal but it
might not seem like it out in the West
and it's dual-sim capabilities now in
the United States you don't really see
dual sims and pretty much any of the
phones and there are some pretty good
reasons for that because that's the way
our phone companies want it they want
you to be on one particular carrier and
not have really any allegiances to
anybody else with the dual SIM phone you
could use the data from one card and
then take calls on another and you can
really cater the experience to what you
want it to be by paying a little bit of
extra money to have two different
carriers in your repertoire but what the
dual sim here you can also use the dual
sims for traveling so if you were to
have your personal home SIM card inside
in the one slot you can have a travel
card in the two slot and not worry about
having to remove anything and switching
them out from time to time but what I
did find is that in the operating system
switching between the two SIM cards can
be a little bit cumbersome having to
change which data you want to use from
which card can sometimes make the phone
slow down and also it takes a little
while for to even register that both of
the SIM cards are in there and switched
between the two now the problem with
that is if you really need to change
from one card to the other let's say you
used up your data from one card and you
want to use the data from the other so
you don't incur any overage charges it
might take a little while for it to
finally finish now whether or not this
is a software issue or if this is just a
way that dual SIM cards really work on
the oneplus 2 remains to be seen I have
had other phones that have had dual-sim
capabilities and they weren't quite as
hard to use as this one that being said
however one will remedy that you can use
here is to go into the SIM card area
choose which SIM cards you want to use
for calls texting or data and then just
restart the phone and it should work
from there now the last Hardware future
we're going to cover is the USB type-c
port on the bottom and its subsequent
cord
now the cord is very similar to the one
you got in the 1+1 in that it is a flat
construction and it comes in that red
and white now having it flat does mean
that it's not going to tangle so easily
which is always nice and it just looks
kind of cool but the best part about the
cord itself is that on either end it is
reversible so no matter how you plug in
no matter what orientation you plug it
into the either the phone or the USB
port it will go through which is nice
kind of takes up the guesswork from the
microUSB once if it was supposed to be
upside down or right side up now the
thing about the USB type-c cord here is
that it is basically a 2.0 construction
which means that it's not going to be
using USB 3.0 for data transfer and it's
not going to be using any quick charging
capabilities trust me I already tried I
used my mode of quick charger and the
phone charged very normally but that
being said the USB type-c charging does
seem to be at least a little bit above
average it's not necessarily a very slow
charger but it's also not a very fast
charger it's kind of in the middle path
when the phone was off it took about 90
minutes to get from zero to 100% when
the phone was on but not being used very
often it took about two hours that's not
terrible obviously we would want to have
our phones charged within the hour like
some of these quick charging
capabilities allow for but the oneplus 2
simply will not be providing that but
really it's nice that oneplus is at
least going to be making those cords
available for a very low price about
five dollars so if you're looking to get
into the standard of USB type-c oneplus
is making it very easy for you to do so
which brings us to the shelf now
originally I thought of the shelf as
just two widgets that were available for
your frequent apps and your frequent
contacts and during our first look that
was pretty much how it was being
marketed but then after a little bit
more investigation I found that the
Shelf is actually a page where you can
put a bunch of different widgets so for
someone like me that usually has just
one page dedicated to some production
apps well now I can put those widgets on
the shelf and just scroll down
underneath the two ones that are already
included and I can have things like the
Evernote app down there to easily access
certain parts of my productivity you can
also customize it a little bit by
changing up the cover on the top small
portion of it that is customizable but
other than that adding various different
kinds of widgets on there is actually
pretty cool and you can always
rearrange them pretty easily really it's
not just a place for you to put or
rather for the phone to put all of the
apps that you use on a frequent basis it
could also be where you put your
frequented widgets that way you will
keep your home screens pretty bare and
everything that you need to use can be
put onto a side home screen and finally
there's the dark mode now the dark mode
is something that's supposed to come in
the future of edition of Android but
oneplus has been able to put it into
their version 2.0 of oxygen OS now the
idea behind the dark mode is to just
take all of the light elements in
Android and make them dark obviously but
the main crux of this is that it will
make the phone easier to view in certain
situations like let's say you're lying
in bed winding down the day and getting
ready for bed and all the lights in your
room are off instead of having this
really bright white color just emitting
in your face you have a darker tone that
makes it a little bit easier on the eyes
now that is a great feature and I have
used it already in the days that I've
had the oneplus 2 and it has proven to
be nice to have at the end of the day
but also I've just kept at the dark mode
on because it tends to really make the
Android interface look different and my
opinion makes it look a little bit
better now the dark mode can be
contextualized in certain applications
like pocket casts it does change the
elements in there as well but one thing
you have to keep in mind is if you're
using any other applications like let's
say reddit you have to go into that
application and find it's dark mode to
make it match it's not going to be
something that is automatic across the
board keep it tuned to Android thority
for my full review of the oneplus 2
we're going to put everything together
including this the camera and the
general usage of it on the daily and I
will give you my full review pretty soon
after we get all the updates from
oneplus to finalize our experience keep
it tuned to Android 34 all of that drop
us some likes on our videos and
subscribe to our channel if you haven't
already and then when you're done with
that listen to the Android podcast and
