because we're going to talk about phones
that you can't even buy yet but you can
soon now with any talk about the best
phones expected for 2016 right at the
top of list has got to be the galaxy s7
whether your Samsung fan or not the
unveiling of the s7 is going to set the
bar for this year's flagship smartphones
and will no doubt sell in the millions
of units while the latest rumor suggests
that Samsung will be sticking with a
very similar design for the s7 and it's
curved edge variant we are expecting a
number of hardware improvements this
year round camera technology would
likely see a leap forward with Samsung
rumored to be either interested in the
twenty five megapixel sony I mx300
sensor or using its own 12 megapixel
bright cell technology which features
larger pixels for superior light capture
other tweaks include a USB type-c port
high-quality audio and a
pressure-sensitive display with many
more also rumoured alright so let's talk
about the HTC One m10 and this time
don't get your hopes up because I know
many of us had our heart broken last
year in contrast to Samsung successful
galaxy range HTC one's em series has
gradually declined in momentum leaving
the Taiwanese companies smartphone
business in a tough spot there aren't
that many rumors about the m10 right now
so really anything could happen we're
certainly expecting high-end hardware
such as qhd display Snapdragon 820
processor and a fingerprint scanner and
hopefully some better camera technology
as well while some still love HTC's
familiar design language it has become
increasingly tough for the general
consumer to tell each generation from
the next perhaps this flagship range is
in need at an aesthetic redesign in
order to kick-start the consumer
interest we can hope but do you know who
has gained momentum hallway let's talk
to huawei p9y away was one of the big
movers in 2015 gaining not only in
bigger market share in China but also
further expanding its presence in Europe
the company recently announced its honor
5x made eight and a SmartWatch that will
be heading to the US the next big
announcement from hallway is expected to
be its flagship p9 smartphone if this
handset also heads to the US
my way will be going right up against
the biggest Android brands in every
global market the paw way p9 won't just
be a big deal for the company's us
ambitions though it's also a showcase
for the best technology that the Chinese
company can offer the latest hardware
rumors point to a 5.2 inch 1080p display
three or four gigabytes of RAM a
fingerprint scanner basically making it
a smaller version of the company's
recently released rather good may date
the smartphone will likely feature the
company's latest in house Kiran 950
mobile system-on-a-chip as well now as
most of you know I'm a Canuck that means
Canadian so I gotta talk about
blackberry where we can likely expect a
mid-ranger the phone won't likely appear
until the second half of the year and
probably won't be a budget offering
either instead blackberry will likely
develop a super mid-tier smartphone
which could grab the attention of value
seeking customers across the globe the
slow and limited availability of the
prive has been acknowledged by Chen
blackberry CEO and might be the biggest
complaint that the company will look
into in addressing the next smartphone
now a few hardcore viewers out there
you're going to know how I feel about
Chen I'm sure he's a great guy but he
should have been replaced as blackberry
CEO right after the launch of the prive
which flopped and it flopped because he
is not a Salesman okay he launched it on
the bnn network here in Canada and the
bnn network is like the USS Bloomberg
and there was no orchestrated launch I
mean if you go to samsung or apple or
any of these massive companies they have
these massively well-organized well
orchestrated launches to sell the
concept of the phone and we had a camera
on phone instead of up on a big screen
to see a screenshot and his apps hadn't
even loaded yet he hadn't even loaded
the phone and he clearly didn't even
know how to use the phone properly and
so he was just goofing around it was an
embarrassingly bad display of
salesmanship unforgivable should have
been gone now the Privy wasn't a bad
phone but it was a painfully bad launch
for a mid-tier phone they've got to have
a new captain at the ship what are you
guys thinking now here's something you
might not have expected let's talk about
Lenovo's project tango one of the more
interesting looking
smart phones that we know is on the way
is Lenovo's project tango handset which
was confirmed at this year's CES well we
don't have the device specifics project
tango integration will open up a load of
interesting new augmented and virtual
reality applications along with some
truly unique software experiences in
case you missed it project tango is a
google run platform based around
computer vision technology the software
uses motion tracking from accelerometers
and gyroscopes along with a specialized
camera set up to collect 3d information
around a space such as depth and
distance from this data application
developers can do things like overlay
augmented information on top of an
object within the cameras field of view
or recreate a real space in virtual 3d
so what do you think what are you most
anticipating in 2016 let me know in the
comments below I'll be reading them and
don't forget about my brothers and
sister an Android will working super
hard to be your source for all things
Android
