Authority what's going on everybody and
here it is I am officially in possession
of an LG G watch thanks to google here
at i/o we're able to pick between the
gear live and the G watch and I opted
for the LG now we're going to go through
a quick unboxing of this just take a
look at what is inside of the box right
now and here we go going to go ahead and
break that seal and then I'll go through
the initial setup now there is a bit of
an interesting story there if you saw
that you are able to buy the G watch in
the gear live on the Google Play Store
yesterday but they are not shipping it
right away and I'll explain that as to
why and here we are this is a gia watch
right here you got the piece of plastic
on here here is the screen now we do
have a pretty sizable bezel all the
rounds of the screen but we're going to
go ahead and just kind of put that aside
for the moment I'll go ahead and just
take it out of the area and I'll give
you my impressions on that in a second
but let's see what else is in the box of
course we do have the AC adapter for the
cord here is the charging cradle now
this is an interesting part obviously we
need to have a charging cradle for a
device like this because you can't just
really put a port on there might make it
look a little unseemly but here it is is
the charging cradle that will go into
that you watch her go into and it's very
squared out it's actually not too
unattractive it's just sort of a square
that goes on the back so you are
actually going to have to put this on on
the back in order for you to charge the
G watch but that is the charging cradle
and then finally we have of course a
micro USB cable now that's pretty much
it aside from a multilingual manual that
is right here and that's pretty much
everything that comes with it
obviously the setup with Android wear
the app on your Android phone is going
to be more important but this is
essentially what we have inside of the
box of the LG G watch and here we go
this is the actual watch itself it looks
like as far as the band goes we have a
silicon band it's definitely not leather
I'll tell you that much like the Moto
360 but that's perfectly fine silicone
bands will allow it to have water
resistance and it will be able to bounce
back from a bunch of splashes I'll be
pretty durable as well I think it's
that's going to be perfectly fine it
also will be replaceable I think I'm
going to put my wideband on here it
looks like I'll be able to do that I'll
try that a little bit later but here is
the general design of the watch itself
what we have is this very square face
right here with the pretty sizable bezel
all around so maybe not a lot of people
are going to enjoy that but I think it's
going to work out just fine especially
if the functionality is there after that
we're going to head over to the back
I'll go ahead and peel this plastic off
right now which will be great
and there you go nice and easy now one
thing I did think was pretty interesting
about the charging cradle is obviously
it's magnetic but since the watch is
able to lie flat if you're going to
charge it just have it connected already
to your microUSB port into the wall and
just lay it right on top it's pretty
easy to just throw it right on top so
charging this thing should be pretty
much a breeze you do have to have the
watch completely open in order to do
this but it's actually kind of nice now
here's an interesting part there are no
buttons on the actual device itself
which might come as a bit of a surprise
because one of the things that I was
trying to figure out was how to turn the
damn thing on looked inside of the
operating manual and I found that you
have to plug it in while it's in the
charging cradle as you can see right
here and it will turn on after being
connected to power now that is kind of
weird but I guess it makes a little bit
of sense because once your watches dead
you'll watch is dead so you have to plug
it in you have to get it charged and
then it will turn on and then just work
from there so here we go and there it is
LG life's good life's alive at least it
might be as much but here is the initial
boot up now the reason why this is a
little bit interesting is because
Android wear is actually not available
on the Play Store yet I had to go
through a few different channels that
were provided by a Google in order to
get a testing version of Android wear
let it connect it at my portable battery
in my pocket right now it's connected to
here but here we go it should only take
a couple minutes to pair with your watch
and here we go
make your watch smart Android wear just
gives you a kind of an idea google fit
it has a focus here inside of the
introduction contact recognition
location google now of course Google now
is sort of the crux of where everything
will be so I hit accept choose a device
G watch f11 see you can see a lot of
people getting their gear lives alive
right now and that's really interesting
but my is the G watch f1 CC pair with
one plus one hit pair on both devices
and here we go nice impaired
you can turn on the watch notifications
so we have to head on over to the
notification settings and make sure
Android wear is enabled so this isn't
too far from what the pebble had you do
when you did it and looks like you're
all done so we're going to go to the
watch and see what we're going to do
with that so here here's a look at some
of the settings that are available you
have the screen always-on silence
connected phone event calendar cards
debugging over Bluetooth of course and
after that hide cards and dim screen
always show so there's just a few of the
options that are available in the
Android wear application we're just
taking a look at these as we're waiting
for the watch to initialize it looks
like it's still downloading it's maybe
about 60% there at the moment and there
it is we have the operating system
finally up it looks like I have quite a
bit of battery life so I'm going to go
ahead and just and take it out of here
it says here you're all set
swipe up to get started let's take a
look great twice try swiping again this
record show I bought an IQ throughout
the day keep swiping you can move cards
when you're done with them swipe to
remove the card removed cars will show
up again when they're useful swipe left
for more details and again for
particular actions that ok got it
because try to dismiss when you're in a
nap touch anywhere on the clock and say
an action such as show me my steps show
me my steps zero because I have not
moved at all I'll go and dismiss that
one last thing to dim the screen cover
it with your palm interesting so let's
see what that looks like
there you go so it looks like I have a
few interactions already MA then are the
notifications are already coming in
that's talent that you're looking at so
if I were to click on here you could see
those you can open it on the phone
already come up I have another
notification from Google Auto Backup so
those are that's an example of the photo
that was backed up to Google and I could
share it from here okay so you do have
some nice functionality here open on
phone is always going to be one that's
available and as we go through I have
yeah I present account and an email I
have a new friend request from one of my
friends five minutes of 24 hour fitness
nearby that I was kind of trying to
check out and right now it is 59 degrees
in San Francisco if I take a look at the
six minutes to there it shows me the map
that's where I am and then it shows
where it is wow that's actually pretty
interesting you can navigate open on
phone what's the next one a system
update is ready that's where the one
plus one I haven't updated it yet then
Instagram open on phone is always
available there over here is a install
update and open on phone so you actually
have the actual notifications that you
get on your phone are pretty much
translated into a nice way on to the
watch itself that's really nice
Instagram coming up again zero steps and
there's the last one so that's the
initial set up in all the notifications
that I had on my phone are all coming up
here in a very nice way already if I
wanted to take a look at what this was
you have to open on phone see now that's
just I just dismissed that
then I'm here to open on phone so it's
just showing me the notification I can't
necessarily read it all now here is one
for Gmail and now that is nice how you
are able to actually start scrolling
through and read it looks like pretty
much the entire thing so that's good I
will give you a first impressions video
on this in a few hours after I get a
better look at what's going on here let
me unmute it real quick and there you go
unmuting means you get all of your
notifications on here it actually has a
really nice interface it looks really
attractive it really doesn't look that
bad at all and after I do some function
I probably mostly texting or making
notes or whatnot I'm going to go ahead
and give you a first impressions video
just kind of showing you what it is that
I feel the operating system is able to
do for me so keep it tuned to Android 34
