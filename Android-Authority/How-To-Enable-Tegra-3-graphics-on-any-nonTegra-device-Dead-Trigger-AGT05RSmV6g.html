is Clayton Youngberg coming at you from
Android Authority calm then I'm on
website for all things Android and if
you've been playing the dead trigger
game at all or watching our recent
videos you know that it has some
optimizations for the Tegra 3 quad core
processor now that can be found in the
lg optimus 4x HD the Nexus 7 tablet Asus
Transformer Prime and you know it's
really nice to have the optimizations in
the game and add some nice flavor to the
game some water effects ragdoll effects
for the zombies and just an all-around
better experience but there is a way to
enable those non Tegra 3 devices so
really quickly we'll just go into our
game I'll show you exactly what I mean
by the differences go ahead and click
the main press and accept and I'll just
point out some of the areas that are
lacking the Tegra 3 enhancements we by
the way we are using our quad core
cortex a9
in our Samsung Galaxy s3 this is our
international version and as you can see
right when we walk in this hallway
usually there is a bunch of water right
here on the ground also there'll be a
steam coming out of the walls here and
then a lot of times when you go through
the different passageways there is water
that drops down on you and also when you
shoot the zombies a ragdoll effect
happens but anyways what we are going to
do to enable the Tegra 3 graphics on the
non Tegra 2 device are we going to exit
the game we want to make sure the game
is not running at all so we're going to
kill the application then we can set our
phone down for a minute what we're going
to need is a root file explorer like ES
File Explorer we're going to need a
rooted device so if you have a galaxy s3
and it's not rooted go ahead and check
out our how to root video and we have
how to root videos for other devices if
you think your device is capable and
it's rooted go ahead and try this mod
but anyways we're going to need the ES
File Explorer we can use any Explorer
that we want but we need to have one
that can actually edit text files so
we're going to go into the ES File
Explorer and okay we're going to go into
our settings after that now we're going
to go
to the sea root explorer only for rooted
devices there and we will grant it
permission so also within the settings
we're going to enable the up to root
directory that's going to allow us to
get past the actual just searching in
the SD card so we're just in the SD card
now and we can go up so now we were in
the root directory we're going to want
to go to data and data again okay so
once we're in data we're going to need
to navigate to the comm madfinger games
dead trigger then we'll go to shared
prefs we need to open the con man finger
game's dead trigger dot xml we need to
open that as a txt file with the es note
editor okay so once we're in the comm
madfinger games dead trigger xml we're
going to be looking for the unity
graphics quality value we're going to
change the value from zero or maybe one
to two then we need to scroll down find
the graphics detail here and change that
value that will be 2 or 0 and we can
change that to 3 now we need to press
menu and click save it is saved
successfully okay then we're going to go
back and we will long press on the file
we need to click properties and then
after we click properties we need to go
to changes and then we need to deselect
the write functionality and now change
the permissions to actually save the
Preferences of the changes we've made
and then another thing you can do is go
back and then we can actually um delete
or move the come madfinger games dead
trigger XML dot bak and once we delete
that we will have our finalized changes
so now that that's deleted we'll go back
we're going to go into our dead trigger
game check out the changes we've made
go into our level here
now as you can see we have our water
which only comes with a Tegra 3 graphics
usually and we also have our steam
coming from their walkthrough cap a few
zombies show you the ragdoll effects so
we've got our ragdoll effects with the
zombies now I'm gonna scope this pool
and then we'll find another little Tegra
enhancement here in just a second I'll
go to where the water drips down we can
actually see that so as we walk through
here we can see that our water is
dripping down and our cortex a9 performs
beautifully under these settings can
definitely handle the load that the
check of three usually does but anyways
guys that was our mod go ahead and try
it out on your own phone you'll be able
to play the full game as it was meant to
be played on the Tegra 3 without the
need of the Tegra 3 and stay tuned
Android 30.com guys we got a lot more
mods reviews and everything android
coming atcha</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
