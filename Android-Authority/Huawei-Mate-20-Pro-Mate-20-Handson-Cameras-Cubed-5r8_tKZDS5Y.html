ok so like a lot of huawei devices that
we cover there's a ton packed into the
Huawei mate 20 probably too much to talk
about in just a hands-on video and I
only had about 20 minutes with the
device that's not like I can give you
any definitive answers anyway I also
want to respect your time so I'm gonna
give you the big stuff first we'll get a
little bit into the nitty-gritty but
we'll do the super in-depth stuff in the
full review it's probably already
noticed already but there's this big
square camera array on the back of the
huawei mate 20 and a lot of Huawei
phones have had three cameras for a
couple of generations now but they've
decided to put them in this array that
just looks extremely different and
always always been about design with
their mate series they always try to
make it look a little bit different than
all the other phones that are out right
now but this one is definitely gonna be
polarizing what's nice is that those
three cameras on the back there actually
serve some function you've got a 3x
telephoto lens with optical image
stabilization you've got a 40 megapixel
lens like we saw on the Huawei p20 and
then we've also got this super wide
angle lens which emulates a focal length
of about 16 millimeters so we just saw
this kind of all-rounder camera design
on the hel GV 40 but the 2x telephoto
lens on there didn't have optical image
stabilization I honestly thought that
that was one of its downfalls so I'm
really happy to see that in huawei's
camera so moving to the front of the
phone we've got a 24 megapixel selfie
camera and that's a lot higher
resolution than we see in a lot of other
phones on the market right now you've
also got things like an IR blaster and a
flood illuminator and those things are
essentially used to create a 3d map of
your face for things like face unlock
and while we saying that it's about 30%
faster than it was previously
so now that we've moved past the cameras
we can move on to the number two big
thing in this phone and that's got to be
the in screen fingerprint reader now
we've seen in certain favorite print
readers in the past they've generally
been pretty crappy always mate RS had it
and it was just plain bad so I'm really
hoping that Huawei has improved upon
this over
time but we'll have to test it and show
you in our full review how good it
actually is number three and probably
one of the cooler features in this phone
we've got wireless charger and I'm not
talking about just charging your phone
with a wireless charger though you can
do that and apparently it's a lot faster
than a lot of other phones right now but
the cool thing about this phone is that
you can charge other devices with the
Huawei mate 20 itself the back of the
phone basically just works like a Qi
charger so you can charge other phones
smartwatches really anything that
charges with Qi which is most things
these days and it's got a four thousand
two hundred million power battery so
you're probably going to have a little
bit more energy than your friends or
anyone else that you need to charge
their device anyway now the fourth and
probably last huge thing that we got to
talk about here is the new Kirin 980
that's in this phone
now they announced this chip a little
bit back but this is the first Huawei
phone to actually feature the chip it's
based on a 780 meter process it's got
about 40% better graphics performance
than the karin 970 and it's using this
new big dot little dot little
architecture which effectively means
that it shifts the big workloads to the
larger part of the cpu and then the
smaller workloads can be managed by
these smaller other increments of the
cpu now I don't want to dive too deep
into this chip because there's a lot to
talk about
but Gary Sims actually made an awesome
video about exactly how this chip works
and why you should care so you should go
check that out after this video always
also added a second MP you or neural
processing unit to this phone which
helps it do things like image
recognition or real time filters so
we've also got a video on what MP use
are and why you should care so check
that out after the video as well alright
now that we've finished with all the
really big features we can move on to
the other little smaller stuff so the
huawei mate 20 pro is going to come with
six to eight gigabytes of RAM and you'll
be able to get it in a hundred and
twenty eight or 256 gigabytes storage
variants now there's no 512 gigabyte
storage variant which is kind of sad to
see but you'll have to get something
like a note 9 if you want to get
something that massive the mate 20 pro
is also ip68 water-resistant so you
don't have to worry about rain you
basically know what that mean
you can get it wet taking in the shower
doesn't really matter the way 20 is
gonna come in five colors which is a lot
of colors for a flagship smartphone
you've got pink gold midnight blue
emerald green Twilight and black and if
you get the midnight blue or the emerald
green models you get this special
backing on the phone that always pulling
in optical display it really kind of
just looks like a feather pattern or
like a tile pattern of some sort it kind
of makes this scratchy sound when you
scratch it that sounds a lot like vinyl
so that was the mid-20 Pro but what
about the meet 20 well last year the
meet 10 and make 10 Pro didn't have that
many differences that changes were like
in the display and aspect ratio and
whether or not had a headphone jack but
in the mate 20 you're actually missing a
ton of features that you're getting in
the May 20 Pro the May 20 doesn't have
the wireless charging dock feature it
doesn't have the in screen fingerprint
reader it doesn't have the 40 megapixel
camera it doesn't have my P 68
water-resistance do you get what I'm
saying here it's missing a lot of the
features that the mate 20 Pro has and
that's a huge differentiation when it
comes to why you would actually buy one
of these phones one way hasn't actually
given us pricing on these two phones yet
but I'm really hoping that they're gonna
make the mate 20 quite a bit cheaper
than the mate 20 Pro because really all
the reasons that you would buy the mate
20 Pro in the first place are reasons
that they're leaving out of the mate 20
so anyways that has been a quick
hands-on of the huawei mate 20 in mate
20 Pro I really do encourage you to go
check out Gary's videos they are awesome
super in-depth and stay tuned to our
website of course cuz we're gonna have
tons of information on both of these
phones and until next time I will see
you in the full review
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
