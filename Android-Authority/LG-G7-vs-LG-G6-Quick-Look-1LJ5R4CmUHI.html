everybody and here we're taking a look
at the LG G 7 versus the G 6 now one of
the reasons why we're taking a look at
this comparison is because the evolution
between G devices has been kind of rocky
and those kinds of changes are not
happening anymore in the g7 as its
influences are pretty clear it comes
from the g6 with a little bit of the V
30 injected in really the main changes
when it comes to design happened to be
in the button layouts the fingerprint
reader on the back is still in a good
place but it is no longer also a power
button as the power button has been
shifted over to the side
LG claims that this is for better
convenience so you don't have to reach
around the phone to actually wake the
phone anymore but another button has
sprouted out of the other side of the
phone and that is the AI key Google
assistant is the AI of choice for the g7
as it was with the g6 however there's a
new way of interacting with Google
assistant by pressing this button you
can press the button to make it do the
same thing that would happen if you were
to hold the home soft key but then you
can also hold the button so that you can
talk to Google assistant like a
walkie-talkie this doesn't sound like
much but it is a very different way of
making sure that Google assistant knows
you have stopped talking because it's
not trying to auto detect for your voice
anymore so then you have the screen and
it is still that slightly taller than
wider display but it's not just 18 by 9
aspect ratio now it is specifically
nineteen point five by nine so what you
have is a little bit more display up at
the top where the notch is basically
just in the middle housing the phone
speaker and the front-facing camera that
notch is something you can customize by
either turning it off or adding some
extra color to it but overall the
handling because of the size of these
screens is pretty similar between these
two devices one thing that we do miss is
an actual second screen if this notch is
called the new second screen but it
doesn't provide any of the features that
were in the second screens of the v10
and the V 20 before it thankfully though
no matter which of these two devices you
might be rocking you do still get the
always-on display still one change from
the g6 to the g7 is a more powerful
display in terms of brightness the IPS
LCD display can get up to 1000 nits
either automatically in broad daylight
or via a quick button press in the quick
toggles so underneath the surface
performance boosts are pretty much par
for the course from one year to the
other and the Snapdragon 820 one
of the LGG six gets that good bump up to
the 8:45 in the LGG seven
now the 821 feels like a long time ago
so that upgrade might just be what
you're looking for and it might be
enough to make you upgrade your g6 but
you also get up to six gigabytes of RAM
and up to 128 gigabytes of on-board
storage in the g7 depending on the
version you get one hit that g7 users
will feel is a 3000 milliamp hour
battery compared to 3300 that you used
to get in the g6 but lowering the
capacity of that battery unit might have
had some auxilary benefits enter the
sound experience the LG G 6 had a
respectable bottom firing speaker but
that same speaker returns in the g7 with
a few very significant tweaks mainly
that the space in the back between the
back cover and whatever it is protecting
is used as the resonance chamber now
that basically means that when you have
audio playing at a loud volume the
entire back vibrates and you can lay
that down on a hard surface to make it
resonate even better this is called
boombox sound and the demos that we saw
hitting the g6 versus the g7 really
showed that there's no competition
the g7 when put onto a hollow container
like a wooden or a cardboard box made
that entire container be the amplifier
it's really awesome to see and
definitely better than putting any other
phone in something like a glass mug
still the quad DAC returns in the
headphone jack which also returns of
course and you also get some surround
sound tweaking so if you do have a good
pair of headphones and this is still a
great place to keep them in the LG camp
and to keep those good times rolling we
can talk about the cameras now LG made
one great enhancement from the g6 to the
g7 that might actually be one of the
main points for your upgrade and that is
the front facing camera the front facing
camera now does great photos
comparatively to the 5 megapixel
shooters of the last two iterations this
8 megapixel shooter just has better
sharpness and does a much better job of
providing selfies for those people who
were really thinking it was lacking in
LG phones the main camera experience is
pretty similar between the two as you
still get a wide angle lens but the
wide-angle lens of the g7 is a little
bit more narrow now it's at 107 degrees
which eliminates some of the distortion
at the expense of just a little bit of
the wide view you still get plenty of
space to play around with though and
both of the lenses on the g7 are now
16 megapixels so they both provide very
similar quality there's also a proper
portrait mode now as well which does a
pretty good job and because one of the
lenses is a wide-angle lens you don't
have to step back because the lens is
trying to zoom into the subject it keeps
the same focal length as the regular
lens and finally a couple of the last
features in the g7 are things we really
want to compare in it compared to the g6
low-light photography is the first of
them the super bright camera mode
actually binds four pixels together so
that the 16 megapixel photos you usually
get become four megapixel photos so that
it can flood in more light and finally
AI gets injected into the G series and
it's similar to the one you might have
seen in the LGV 30s the AI in the g7
basically means that there are thousands
of terms that have been put into the
camera software and it is trying to
figure out what subject you are pointing
the camera at once it figures that out
it will change the settings so that you
get a better photo overall for example
if you take a picture of a plant or of a
tree then the saturation will get bumped
up and in the case of greenery the
greens are going to be more prevalent
we're excited to put these two phones up
against each other but this is just a
quick look at them and really just a way
for us to say that if you are still
using an LG G 6 well there are a few
features that we've outlined in this
video that might already convince you to
upgrade sure the battery life might take
a little bit of a hit but the
front-facing camera is already in and of
itself a great enhancement that we think
a lot of people will be clamoring for if
they're still using older LG devices
boombox sound and upgraded specs in
general are also reasons why you might
want to make the jump
so LG G 6 users let us know what you
think and if you plan on updating to the
g7 and let us know why in the comments
