start last year with their Nokia lineup
and it looks like they're keen not to
lose any of that momentum at MWC the
company is announcing a lineup of five
new phones for 2018 and there's some
really interesting designs and features
here to delve into first up HMT is
bringing back another nostalgic Nokia
classic the 8110 look I remember this
quite as much as the 3310 but there you
go
this banana shaped feature phone will be
running Kos with 4G support and like the
revamp 3310 is positioning itself to be
a great secondary device to take on
nights out or use as a conversation
starter at 79 euros that's a very
affordable proposition and the device
will be landing in May the first Android
offering though is Nakia one which hmd
hopeful services transition device for
those moving from feature phones to
their first smartphones so she'll be
running Android Audio 8.1 Go Edition and
is made to be tough with coloured
polycarbonate surrounding the chassis
looks a little bit similar to a Lumia it
comes with a 5 megapixel rear camera 2
megapixel on the front and I'll be
available from April 2018 for 85 USD a
considerable step up though is the all
new Nokia 6
other recent offerings this will be
machined from a single block of
aluminium giving it a durable and
attractive design it looks and feels
really nice and it's definitely very
premium for a mid-range frame the new
Nokia 6 hours will now get to benefit
from the Zeiss optics and the both the
dual sight made previously NECN nokia
rate they'll also get 360 spatial audio
and a bump up to the Snapdragon 630 to
offer a 60% speed increase
it'll also support fast charging there's
a 5.5 inch polarized display will remain
the same this one will also be available
from April and comes with either three
gigabytes or four gigabytes of RAM and
32 gigabytes or 64 gigabytes of storage
respectively it will set you back around
279 euros the nokia 7 plus meanwhile is
an even more interesting proposition
threatening to take the crown in the
affordable premium space this device has
once again cut from a single block of
6000 series aluminium but now it's also
coated in six layers of ceramic paint
this not only ensures it feels great in
the hand but it also helps to hide any
antenna lines the edges are anodized
twice for even more colour variety and
it's genuinely very slim and solid and
premium feeling what's more is that this
is the first
Nakia device to support an 18 by 9
aspect ratio this creates plenty of real
estate on that six inch full HD display
it also gets a slight upgrade over the
original Nokia 7 with its snapdragon 616
processor then comes with 4 gigabytes of
RAM and 64 gigabytes of storage a bigger
upgrade is in the kamek department which
now brings us the same Zeiss optics here
as well and the dual lens setup on the
back combining a 12 megapixel and a 13
megapixel sensor with the latter being
used for telephoto the pro camera
application will provide manual control
over aperture exposure white balance etc
and provide real-time feed news to users
to see what they're getting that's a lot
of bang for your buck considering the
asking price is just 399 euros this will
also be available from April when you
can be sure we'll be putting it through
its full paces but there's still one
more to go the nokia 8 Sirocco is poised
to represent hm DS most premium design
possible and to that end it's this time
machined from a single stainless steel
block which is reportedly meant to be
able to withstand 450 pounds of pressure
or 3 in grown men so this is the phone
you can stand on with your friends if
you want to another first for the Nokia
brand is here as well - a 3d curved
Gorilla Glass display which bends around
the sides of the device
in a manner similar to a galaxy this
contributes to an incredibly thin side
profile and the whole thing looks a lot
more flagship II as a word than the
Nokia rate of old other more
forward-thinking features include a 2 KP
OLED display ip67 wireless charging 128
gigabytes of storage and an impressive 6
gigabytes of RAM it features the same
high-end camera specs as the Nokia 7
plus along with the same spatial audio
capture seen on the original nokia rate
the only things preventing this from
being a home run is a the decision to
includes the same snapdragon 835 seen in
the last gen offering and the 16 by 9
ratio on that 5.5 inch screen it feels
very strange to have a lineup where the
most premium device is not also the
tallest of course that's a matter of
taste however and some people may
appreciate the more compact form factor
here and to be fair this is also
considerably more affordable than your
galaxy's
at just 749 euros this one will be
available from April as well hmd made a
point during the presentation of
committing to a pure Android experience
repeating the mantra of pure sake
and up-to-date to that end all their
devices from the Nokia three upwards
will now be part of the Android one
program that means minimal bloatware and
rapid updates which is something that
the company has been very good about so
far this will come as great news to many
viewers and may even be a deciding
factor for fans of the stock Android
experience there's a huge amount to take
in here and you certainly can't fault
hit gem DS ambition these devices are
undeniably well made and Panzers will be
very happy to hear about the commitment
to pure Android experience but is it a
case of too much of a good thing is the
lack of a clear nomenclature going to
confuse buyers and would you rather see
an 18 by 9 flagship most likely the
hardware will do the talking here and of
course we'll be bringing you a more
detailed thoughts on that once we have
more time with these devices however you
cut it though this is an impressive
showing from hmd global and we can't
wait to try them out who knows maybe
this does in fact mark the beginning of
Nokia's climb back to the top so thanks
