family comes with a round face and along
with a couple other tricks up its sleeve
does the Motorola package help it dance
circles around the rest well let's find
out because it's Josh Bogart from Angela
thority what's going on everybody and
this is your review of the Moto 360
right off the bat you notice the round
face perhaps its most marketed feature
now I've made jokes about this watch
design being like an Oreo strapped to
your wrist but in all honesty that
wasn't meant to being really a negative
while liking the design of the watch is
certainly a matter of taste what I do
like is that it's a neutral profile and
it's simplistic design actually make it
fit with the most amount of styles
silver and black versions of the metal
construction are available and one
button is found on the side where you
would expect it to be though it does a
little more than wake the device or
access the system menu the leather band
is pretty thin compared to the body but
it is not unattractive though if you
wanted to change the band out you might
run into some problems the bars that
hold Amanda in place are tucked pretty
far into the plastic back making it
tough to easily find bands that can
actually fit in there there has been a
lot talk about the small black area on
the bottom of the face and how a blemish
is the otherwise round face but knowing
that the light sensor is found under
there helps the backlash somewhat though
it does get in the way of that tiny
portion of the watch face it isn't
something that you won't get used to
after a little bit of time whether or
not this is the best kind of design for
Android wear as a matter of your opinion
but I will admit that motos presentation
is one that seems to fit the most styles
with the screen on or off the simple
round design helps the 360 blend it to
just about any ensemble and that is
probably the most appealing part of the
watch at least to me a one point five
six inch display comprises the watch
face and obviously it's round the
Gorilla Glass 3 surface should be able
to withstand some punishment and as far
as colors go the carbs and information
displayed don't look bad at all what
strikes me most about this watch is its
size by far it is the largest slate that
is available for Android wear thus far
and does well to display everything in a
pretty easy to read fashion touch
sensitivity wasn't much of an issue at
all though having a round face does pose
some challenge
any applications that require precision
swipes from a corner require special aim
after some time you get the hang of it
but it has proven to be a nuisance on
more than one occasion already now
underneath were actually not working
with the snapdragon 400 which has been
somewhat common with Android wear
devices my instead we have a TI OMAP 3
processor that pretty much does still
provide the same kind of experience
performance on the 360 as such has
maintained good speeds throughout never
showing signs of slowdown and more
importantly not resetting after any
usage now beyond the standard and
expected performance the hardware is
where these smartwatches will truly
differentiate themselves and the Moto
360 has more than just a round face to
do so
IP certification helps to brave the
elements so you can basically wear this
watch whenever and wherever you want a
heart rate monitor is found underneath
as well and I have to admit I like the
way it looks better than any of the
other ones currently available heart
activity is presented on an important
scale that shows you your upper and
lower limits which I really like and it
will monitor periodically throughout the
day so you know how much strenuous
activity you've had or not wireless
charging is probably the other marquee
feature here and I think it's the best
charging implementation yet for Android
wear an included dock allows the watch
to lie on its side and when detected the
watch face will rotate so that the watch
continues performing like a clock it
addresses one fundamental issue with
smartwatches that when they're off your
wrist
they are far less useful charging
doesn't take too long which is another
plus and might prove most important for
those of you hearing mixed battery
reports in my case the battery life on
the Moto 360 has been okay the Moto 360
right here on my wrist out of the box
was not able to really get past five or
six hours without dying completely but
after draining the battery a few times
and charging it back to full it was
finally working for around 12 hours give
or take though that still cuts it pretty
close to bedtime and that is still a big
point docked off for this wearables
overall longevity until Android wear
goes through some updates the software
experience is about the same no matter
which wearable you get in the ecosystem
currently notifications are shown via
cards that you swipe up and down through
heart rate monitoring is available if
the hardware allows for such step
counting is a
and some extra functions based upon any
applications that you might install
basically give you the rest of the gist
what I will say is that the cards are
actually quite huge in Motorola's
presentation on this round face covering
up a large amounts of what could be an
attractive background but it's just a
minor gripe of my own now the main
change is the inclusion of a Motorola
application that allows you to change
the look of the watch faces and add your
own biometrics for more accurate health
monitoring as the ROG face is round
pretty much every face takes on an
analogue motif even this digital one
that still has the ticker around the rim
and speaking of the round faced it does
pose some challenges to a pin watch face
developers that have yet to change their
code to match it it might not be a big
deal after some time but right now there
are some apps that just don't work well
right now when the round faces early
days but I'm sure that there will be
some updates to the absent question only
right now it just looks kind of awkward
as always voice commands are the main
way of navigating through a lot of the
functions in Android wear and the Moto
360 is no exception
you can always tap on the screen to get
there or just say ok Google and from
there you can go straight to saying any
of the commands that you want to put in
like sending a voice dictated text to
people or to start a countdown timer or
a number of different applications that
will be found on the watch itself but
some commands still go straight to the
phone rather than being shown on the
watch which is still a limitation when
it comes to Android wear the Moto 360 is
available from pre-order now after being
sold out for a while and it comes in at
$249 which is a premium price for the
kind of quality that you do get in the
hardware so it does kind of make sense
both of the other current Android wear
devices are cheaper with the gear live
shaving off $50 and the LG G watch
falling in the middle between these two
and so there you have it the Moto 360 to
some people the Moto 360 might feel like
a round face just for the sake of having
a round face though there might be some
flaws here and there mainly in the
battery life that actually just kind of
barely gets by a neutral but attractive
styling makes this a device that
actually toes the line between smart and
watch where plenty of other screams
smarts and just make you look incredibly
geeky not that that's a bad thing it has
its flaws and perhaps other
manufacturers will better crack the
round
factor but for now because of its
all-around simpler take on the
SmartWatch game especially in its
charging this just might be the softest
entry point into Android wear we have
yet as always thank you guys very much
for watching and hope you enjoyed this
review of the Moto 360 I do think that
as far as Android wear goes it's a
pretty good SmartWatch especially
because it takes some of the tropes of
smartwatches and makes them a little bit
easier to fathom for example the round
face that makes it pretty much able to
blend in with a lot of your ensembles
but also the charging dock that does
make up for some of the abysmal battery
life as I mentioned before on the
battery section but nonetheless it is
available for 249 so you can see if this
or the LG G watch and they Samsung gear
live which you can see in videos over on
the side might be better for you so keep
it tuned to your to Android Authority
for all of the best coverage including
all of our Android wear coverage you can
also see a lot of our Aoife coverage
which is where I first got to put on the
Moto 360 out in the ephah in Berlin and
you can see those videos here on our

course head on over to android authority
