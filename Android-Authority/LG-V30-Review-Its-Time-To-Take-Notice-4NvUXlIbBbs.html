flagship for the second half of 2017 and
the LGV series of smartphones has always
been about photography videography and
audio and that's what makes the LGB 30
so exciting and we'll get into all that
stuff but first let's get all the basic
smartphone stuff out of the way starting
off with these specs you have a
snapdragon 835 processor 4 gigabytes of
RAM and it also comes with 64 gigs of
internal storage standard but there's
also a plus model which will vary by
region that comes with a hundred and
twenty eight gigabytes of internal
storage but there's also a micro SD card
slot if you need more now as far as
performance goes it's very fast it
performs just as well as you would
expect for a flagship phone it's fast
its fluid it's very responsive it's fast
to launch apps it's quick to multitask
it's also really good at playing
graphically intensive games without any
stuttering or slowdown so I've had no
issues with the performance of the V 30
it performs extremely well in day-to-day
use and even in heavy use like most
phones that we're seeing in 2017 the LG
v 30 is water and dust resistant it's IP
68 which means it's protected for up to
one and a half meters for up to 30
minutes so this means you can use it in
the rain or drop it in a puddle of water
and it'll be perfectly fine the
fingerprint sensor of the V 30 is on the
back and it's nice and centered so it's
easier to reach with your index finger
and it's a very fast and accurate
fingerprint sensor I haven't had any
issues with it
but what I really enjoy about LG's
implementation with their fingerprint
sensor is that it also doubles as the
power key and this is something that LG
has been doing for a while now and I
kind of really wish that more
manufacturers would adopt this feature
like previous LG V Series smartphones
the V 30 is military 810g transit drop
compliant which means it's much more
durable against drops but I still don't
recommend dropping this phone because
it's a really pretty looking phone now
unlike the v10 and V 20 which arguably
had a more industrial and more unique
design the V thirty's design is a little
bit more elegant and more mainstream and
is very similar to a lot of smartphones
in terms of design and what we're seeing
in 2017 so it has glass in the front
glass on the back and a metal frame that
wraps around the sides and I really like
the design of the v30 I think it's a
very good-looking phone it feels
extremely comfortable in the hand as
well with the rounded corners and the
slightly tapered back the glass back
obviously does mean that it collects a
lot of fingerprints but that's just sort
of to be expected when you have a phone
that's made predominantly of glass this
new design also means that the battery
is no longer removable which to me is
not that big of deal and battery life on
the LGB 30 has been extremely good it
has a pretty decently sized 3300
milliamp hour battery which has been
enough to get me through a full day
whether I'm using the phone more
casually with a lot of texting web
browsing and social media maybe a couple
YouTube videos here and there or even if
I'm using it really heavily and playing
a lot of games watching a lot of YouTube
taking a lot of photos it still lasts me
comfortably all day and screen on time
typically hovered around the 5 hour mark
on the front LG has made some pretty
significant changes to the display it is
now a six inch OLED display with quad HD
resolution and an aspect ratio of 18 by
9 LG is calling this the full efficient
display which is really just a fancy
buzzword for a screen that goes edge to
edge and has really thin bezels around
all sides now the 6 inch screen may
sound really massive but because of the
thinner bezels and the aspect ratio that
makes that screen less wide it actually
doesn't feel like a 6 inch screen smart
phone in your hand the screen itself
looks absolutely gorgeous and I'm really
happy that LG has gone back to using
OLED the screen is very vibrant and
colourful it has great viewing angles
it's pretty easy to see outdoors as well
and everything just looks incredible
on this display and the corners are
rounded just like it was on the g6 but
they're actually properly rounded this
time whereas the g6 looked a little bit
funky but this is a beautiful looking
screen and can easily give Samsung a run
for its money it is that good of a
screen the other big difference with the
v30 screen is that it no longer has a
secondary display like they'd be 10 and
the b20 did and because the secondary
display is gone
now it's actually been replaced with a
software feature called the floating bar
and I actually like this a lot better
because the floating bar can be
repositioned to where you can easily
reach it whereas the secondary display
it was always at the top or was kind of
hard to get to and it was little bit
uncomfortable and the floating bar does
all the same stuff that the secondary
screen did so you still have access to
app shortcuts click contacts meeting
controls etc and because it's a software
feature you can actually disable it if
you don't want it whereas the secondary
display you are pretty much stuck with
it whether you liked it or not the rest
of the software is pretty typical LG the
icons are still very bright and colorful
and the whole entire UI is still
somewhat cartoony and there's still some
weird animations like the stretch effect
that you get from swiping between home
screen to home screen but you can
however switch things up a bit with the
theme engine and sort of change up the
look and feel of the UI if you don't
like the way it looks by default and
something I also really enjoy with the
v30 is the always-on display feature
it's highly customizable with a bunch of
different clocks and there was also a
ton of pre-loaded images they can use to
customize the always-on display or you
can use an image from your own gallery
which I thought was really cool it's
running Android new get out of the box
right now which I thought was a little
bit weird especially since last year
they were able to launch the b20 with
the latest version of Android but I
guess they couldn't pull the same trick
off this year so hopefully it'll get
updated to Android Oreo pretty soon now
the two big centerpieces to the v30 is
audio and the camera let's start with
audio first and for starters yes it does
have a headphone jack so no adapter
required here to use your favorite pair
of headphones and this year the
headphone jack has been moved to the top
whereas the B 10 and B 20 had it on the
bottom I personally prefer it at the
bottom I think it's a much more
convenient location but it's not really
that big of a deal just something to
keep in mind there's also a 32 bit high
5 quad Daken side and unlike the g6
where it was a region exclusive all
versions of the V 30 will have a quad AK
and all of them will also be tuned by
bno some of the benefits that you get
from the quad DAC is less noise less
distortion and much better
dynamic range and can also properly
drive a high impedance pair of
headphones and you don't necessarily
need a pair of high impedance headphones
to hear the difference but that will
give you the best audio quality possible
and audio quality on the b30 is just
absolutely incredible it sounds amazing
and it's pretty much unparalleled by any
other smartphone with the exception of
maybe the you 11 but the audio quality
is fantastic I think a lot of audio
files will really enjoy what the b30 can
provide with that quad DAC another
feature on the V 30 that a lot of people
really like is the support for mqa which
stands for master quality authenticated
and this basically allows you to stream
high res audio at a much smaller file
size so it's not going to kill your
bandwidth and right now there aren't a
ton of streaming services that support
it but title is one of the most notable
ones so if you have a title subscription
and you have the proper subscription
tier you can take advantage of this
feature right away FX HD support is also
on board which is Qualcomm's high res
audio codec for wireless or Bluetooth
devices Android or EO has this feature
natively built in but LG was able to
implement it regardless
so you've want high res audio over
Bluetooth devices you have that option
as well alright so let's talk about
those cameras so you have dual cameras
on the back the main sensor is a 16
megapixel sensor with F 1.6 aperture
which makes it the brightest lens on a
smartphone right now and it also has
optical image stabilization the
secondary sensor is a wide-angle lens at
13 megapixels at F 1.9 no OAS here but
it doesn't really need it because it's
such a wide angle and the focus is set
to infinity there's a couple of new
features with this camera the biggest
one is the ability to shoot log footage
and log footage is something you
typically find on a DSLR or a mirrorless
camera and this basically lets you shoot
a completely flat image that has much
better dynamic range so you can
manipulate it a lot heavier in post in
terms of color grading and color
correcting but the log footage on the B
30 is not really all it's cracked up to
be it's really nice to have but the
bitrate is extremely low and it also is
a very green
it's very tough to color grade very
tough to color correct it's hard to get
these skin tones and everything to look
natural and because the bitrate is so
low it's kind of hard to push things
around without the image falling apart
so it's definitely not all it's cracked
up to be and it could have been a lot
better if you don't want to deal with
post-production which I don't think a
lot of people do there's another feature
called Sena video that allows you to
apply color grading presets directly in
camera and it's very simple very quick
and easy to do and gives you the desired
look that you want in just a couple of
seconds as far as picture quality goes
the photos are vibrant colorful with
plenty of detail and I don't think the
v30 over sharpen is quite as much as
previous LG phones but the dynamic range
is definitely not as good as something
like Samsung's camera it does have the
tendency to overexpose in a lot of
different situations now as expected the
wide-angle lens is not as good as the
main sensor in terms of quality but it
is a ton of fun to use I really enjoy
using the wide-angle lens because you
can get some really breathtaking lancia
shots group photos are a lot easier to
take as well there's just a ton of
situations where that wide-angle lens
really does come in handy
it does struggle a lot more in low-light
the photos are a lot softer and the
white balance is not quite as good but
they did at least fix the barrel
distortion you don't have that GoPro
like look the photos look a lot more
normal now which I really appreciate but
if you're really concerned about quality
and low-light I definitely recommend
sticking to the main sensor as the
photos are a lot sharper they're more
detailed and the white balance and
overall color is a lot better pricing
for the lgbtq starts around eight
hundred dollars and that price will vary
depending on carrier and it's pretty
typical flagship price and I think the
LG v 30 is worth every penny it has a
beautiful design a gorgeous display and
the audio photography and videography
experience is just on a whole another
level when it comes to smartphones and a
lot of people have been underrating the
V series over the last couple of years
and it's about time people paid
attention to it because the V 30 is
doing a lot of really big things and
it's doing them extremely extremely well
so give it B 30 a look
you might be very impressed by what you
find so that wraps up our review of the
LGB 30 I hope you all enjoyed it and
