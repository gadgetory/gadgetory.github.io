personal or corporate information that
you wouldn't want to hand over to just
any stranger that's why you take steps
to secure your Android device and the
data that it holds one great way to
secure the data on your Android phone or
tablet is through encryption hello I'm
mark welcome to android authority in
this episode I'm going to talk about
encrypting data on your Android device
I'll talk a bit about encryption as well
as how to encrypt your Android phone or
tablet encryption is the process of
scrambling information thereby making
the data no longer recognizable or
understandable by unauthorized parties
the process can be reversed
it's called decryption and one will need
a decryption key through decryption the
Scramble data can be made comprehensible
again because scrambled data is
practically useless to anyone who
doesn't have a decryption key encryption
is actually a strong way to keep your
data secure I'll use a simple
illustration to show how encryption
works let's say you have the word
Android as text data on your phone and
you want no-one to be able to read it so
you decide to encrypt it for purposes of
simplicity let's use a very simple
substitution key to scramble the text
let's substitute a with C B with D C
with E and so on so when encoded or
encrypted the word Android will become
this it doesn't look like a word a it
has become just a meaningless string of
letters except for those who know that C
stands for a P stands for n and so on a
similar thing happens to your data when
you encrypt it although in a more
complex and sophisticated way than just
substituting a with C as you can see
encrypting your device can further
secure your data it won't prevent your
Android from being stolen but it can
prevent a thief from using your
encrypted data unless a thief is smart
enough to know how to decrypt the data
for most people setting a pin or
password lock usually suffice us for
keeping prying eyes away for those who
need tighter security
there's encryption if you're considering
encryption for your Android phone or
tablet take note of a few important
things first your
could show some lag after encryption the
process uses device resources slow
devices with limited resources could
suffer a performance hit the lag will
depend on factors such as processor RAM
and disk read/write speed second initial
full disk encryption can take a long
time depending on the amount of data to
encrypt don't ever interrupt your device
while it is in the middle of encrypting
you could permanently lose some or all
of your data third once you encrypt your
device there's no turning back
encryption is irreversible the only way
to return it to an unencrypted state is
to reformat your device and lose all
your encrypted data in the process
fourth you will not be able to use
either swipe or pattern as your screen
lock
if you've grown overly attached to
either of them you'll have to learn to
live without them if you want an
encrypted phone lastly you will need to
enter your password or PIN every time
your encrypted device boots up since the
pin or password is also your decryption
key you could say it's inconvenient but
I think it's a small price to pay for
tighter security if these warnings don't
deter you then go ahead and encrypt your
Android device I'll show you how first
set up a pin or password as your screen
lock it will be used as the decryption
key some devices impose minimum
requirements for the pin or password
such as on the galaxy s4 just comply
with manufacturer's restrictions once
your screen lock is set go to the
settings menu then tap security tap this
to go to the encrypt phone page the menu
location may be different on other
devices on the HTC One for example
you'll find it by going to settings and
then tapping storage at the encrypt
phone page you'll see some reminders and
warnings read and understand them at the
bottom you'll also see info about your
battery power you'll see recommendations
to charge your phone if needed
encryption can only proceed if your
device has enough power if everything is
ready tap this button enter your pin or
password for confirmation a final prompt
or warning message will be shown confirm
that you want to begin encryption by
tapping this button there your device
will now reboot and start encrypting
data you will see a progress indicator
during the encryption
it can take some time so you might want
to let the phone do its job unattended
once inscription is done your device
will reboot and ask for your decryption
key before it boots back to normal mode
just enter your PIN or password your
device will then decrypt your data and
boot into normal mode ready for you to
use and you're done
you have successfully encrypted your
Android phone some phones with external
storage also allow encryption of data on
the microSD card generally you'll find
the commands by going to settings then
security then tap on encrypt external sd
card the menu names and locations may
vary from device to device in most cases
you'll be able to choose whether to
encrypt the whole microSD card exclude
or include media files in the encryption
or encrypt only new files but not the
existing ones be careful when encrypting
your SD card some devices reformat the
card before applying encryption some
devices let you turn off SD card
encryption without wiping data although
other devices do reformat the card in
the process of disabling SD card
encryption if you intend to share your
microSD card among more than one device
remember that SD card data encrypted by
one device will not be readable on
another device you can also encrypt your
data with the help of Android apps
several of such apps are on the Google
Play Store and usually offer more
flexibility than androids own native
encryption feature SSE universal
encryption app and encryption manager
are two simple and easy to use examples
of such apps to encrypt files using SSE
Universal encryption app just tap this
button and select the file that you want
to encrypt tap this button and enter a
password the app then encrypts the
selected file it's that easy to prevent
the app from retaining an unencrypted
copy of the original file toggle this
option in the apps settings page to the
Tripta file select an encrypted file and
tap decrypt type in your password when
asked the app then decrypts your file
the app includes a password vault that
you can use to store your passwords
securely you can also encrypt and
decrypt confidential text with the apps
text
scripture in the case of the encryption
manager app you'll need to set a pin
first time you launch the app the pin
serves as a master key to all app
features make sure you don't forget or
miss type the pin if you provide an
incorrect in more than six times the app
will automatically deletes all your
encrypted files to encrypt a file or
folder tap this button and locate the
file or folder long tap on the file and
tap manage encrypted before encryption
begins you can tell the app to delete to
the original file
after encryption if you select a folder
you can also opt to include files and
subfolders or delete empty folders after
encryption you can also choose what
encryption algorithm to use encrypted
files will appear on the apps main menu
just tap on an encrypted file to decrypt
the file and open it
you may not be fully aware of it but
your Android phone or tablet is a
storehouse of precious personal or
corporate information contacts credit
card information emails SMS documents
files and more would you easily hand
these over to a stranger of course not
that's why you must enforce security
measures on your Android device in this
video I showed you how to safeguard your
Android data through encryption I hope
you consider using encryption as an
extra layer of protection for your
precious data for more Android guides
