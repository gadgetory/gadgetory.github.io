ladies and gentlemen I'm Joe Hindy the
android authority app guy and welcome
back to android apps weekly let's jump
right into those headlines google is
giving us a look at its brand new design
language which is aimed to make
everything on the web and mobile look
the same so far Google search has been
updated to mixed reviews thanks to the
colored microphone but otherwise it
seems to look pretty good google also
has a new logo samsung has announced
that they're working with european
digital publisher axel springer to
create a new curated news application
specifically for their galaxy devices
it'll be known as up day which will
debut in select markets very soon and
roll out slowly to everyone else noodle
cake studios has announced that they're
working with built by snowman to bring
the hit iOS game altos adventure to
android the snowboarding game was hailed
for its slick graphics and unique
gameplay and we're all very excited
about it then droid developer Morgan
culbertson pleaded guilty to federal
charges revolving around the creation of
his malware application the malware
could infect devices and give the hacker
access to all kinds of wicked things if
convicted Morgan could face up to 10
years in prison and 250 thousand dollars
in fines YouTube is preparing for a
fundamental change according to multiple
sources that will evolve into a mixture
of free videos ad-supported videos and
premium videos complete with a paywall
according to other sources this is
because YouTube actually doesn't
contribute to profit and Google really
wants to change that if you want the
complete list of awesome android apps
and games news you should definitely
subscribe to our newsletter we send it
out every single friday and we've even
made some changes to make it look much
nicer if you're interested head to the
written companion which is linked in the
video description below in order to sign
up while you're at it don't forget to
check out our twitch channel will be
streaming on monday at four pm eastern
standard time why only one day this week
well we're gonna be playing around with
youtube gaming also so be sure to keep
an eye out for that the twitch link is
in the video description below ok folks
let's take a look at the apps and games
that made a big splash this week as
usual if you want to check any of these
applications out you can find the links
in the video description below google
has released a new application called
google on this nifty little application
is used to control configure an
interface with the Google on hub router
and it remains one of the best router
interfaces that I've ever seen it has a
good design it's easy to use and it
makes it
much easier to manage it's totally free
but of course you'll be the google onhub
router which will run you one hundred
and ninety-nine dollars mera tip is a
new streaming application that works a
bit differently than most where
periscope uses your camera and twitch
does games mera tip allows you to stream
pretty much anything you're doing on
your device it is in beta so you can
expect bugs here and there but it's a
nifty idea and even lets people engage
with whatever it is you're streaming
it's also free to use Street View the
application has been around for quite
some time but it was updated to version
2 point 0 this last week and has become
a full-fledged standalone application it
still does most of the same street view
things like give you 360-degree imagery
and it still contributes to google maps
but with the new update you can push
photospheres to Street View for
immediate use it'll be a fun application
to keep around unkilled is the latest
shooter out of madfinger games
developers of the acclaimed shadowgun
and dead trigger games this one features
fantastic graphics and simple gameplay
where you collect weapons mow down
zombies and a whole lot more there are
boss fights over 300 missions and over
50 weapons to collect and use we're not
entirely sure why this just wasn't
called dead trigger 3 but it is still a
lot of fun just be aware of those
release day bugs for the first time in
the history of mobile gaming there is a
real actual Pokemon game now available
for android unfortunately it's not the
kind we really wanted but at least it's
a start this Pokemon game is a matching
puzzle game where you must match icons
and that deals damage to the Pokemon
you're currently battling it's cutesy
and simple and worth a shot if you
happen to like Pokemon and puzzle games
thanks again for watching the video
everybody but let's get down to some
serious business this week's Android
apps weekly is sponsored by / be / be as
a social application where you can post
what you're doing and where you're doing
it other members who are near you will
be able to see your post and then heart
them if they're interested in doing
about the same activity once that
happens you'll have the option to chat
with them and set things up it's a fun
little application with a clean design
and a fairly straightforward premise it

download it so why not give it a shot
