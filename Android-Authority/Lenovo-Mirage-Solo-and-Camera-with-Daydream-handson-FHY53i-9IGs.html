view still hasn't seen the light of day
but partners like Lenovo are stepping in
to fill that gap Lenovo just announced
its new Mirage solo headset which uses a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 to power Google
daydream without a phone it's completely
standalone it uses the same daydream
controller as the official model to
control the virtual world around you The
Mirage solo is bigger than a regular
daydream headset but it's still pretty
compact for all the power it's packing
inside it puts most of the pressure on
your forehead on like Google's model and
it's remained pretty comfortable for the
hour or so that we had to mess with it
Lenovo's packing high quality lenses
with a 110 degree field of view and that
should keep everything nice and sharp
while minimizing the screen door effect
you're not gonna get quite as wide a
field of view as something like the pi
max of VR headset but it's pretty
respectable for daydream oh yeah
and since this is using a Snapdragon 835
you're also gonna get six degrees of
freedom to work with that means you can
duck jump and peek around corners to
really feel like you're immersed in a
new world without any wires alongside
the solo Lenovo also announced the
Mirage camera this is a stereoscopic
camera that can capture 13 megapixel
photos and video in a white of 180
degree field of view it doesn't have any
sort of screen or viewfinder on it but
you can easily see where you're
capturing with the included app you can
use this with Google daydream or just
share it to YouTube or Google photos you
can also livestream with this thing with
the tap of a button there is a tripod
thread built into the bottom so it's
pretty obvious that lenovo wants you to
take this with you wherever you go some
run solo heads that's gonna cost you
four hundred and forty nine dollars and
emraan camera is gonna cost two hundred
and twenty nine dollars both of them
will be available in q2 of 2018
and make sure you stay tuned to android
authority for all the latest because of
course we are your source for all things
