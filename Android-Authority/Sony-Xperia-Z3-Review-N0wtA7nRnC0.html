are some concerns about what kind of
upgrades we would see in each new Sony
Xperia release and in this review we see
if that worry actually holds up hey it's
Josh regard from Android Authority and
this is the Sony Xperia z3 if there's
one thing you can count on what Sony
it's their design language once again we
have the black site design consisting of
dual glass panels held together by a
metal frame the metal frame has been
given a more polished rounded look and
feel giving it an even sleeker profile
than was found in previous iterations a
classic trope of Sony phones returns
with the big silver power button the
volume rockers and a dedicated camera
button down on the bottom portion but
given that the buttons needed to blend
in with a much more rounded design I
unfortunately did feel that they were
not as meaty as before there isn't that
much distance in the press and it just
doesn't feel as good as it did in
previous versions some changes have been
made to the already established formula
though the covers also have a rounded
and polished look to them now feeling
completely flush with the frame the
presence gives sign to another big Sony
trope water and dust resistance the dual
front facing speaker setup has also been
altered to a couple smaller grilles
rather than the slits that were found on
the Xperia z2 if you already liked the
design language that Sony puts into
their experian well you're going to like
the Xperia z3 however I will say that
because of the very soft feeling sides
and the dual glass panels I did find
that the phone felt pretty slippery at
times I didn't constantly feel like I
was going to drop the film but that
thought did come up from time to time
and also because it is glass on both
sides it's really hard to get this
fingerprint and smudge prone phone to
look as pristine as it did when I first
took the plastic off I will go ahead and
say that the further perfected design of
this Xperia v chip is a worthy upgrade
from the version from half a year ago
and it is as enticing for veteran users
as it should be for newcomers long gone
are the days when we were somewhat
underwhelmed by the screen of the Xperia
z1 as the improvements were plainly
shown the z2 they then carried over and
now provide these z3 with a great
display experience the same enhancements
to this IPS LCD display returned in the
triluminos tech and the ex reality
engine ultimately providing an even
better color production here than found
in standard IPS offerings the result is
a screen coming in at 5.2 inches 10
resolution and 424 pixels per inch that
provides a lot of contrast and the kind
of viewing prowess you'd come to expect
from let's say Sony televisions text
looks great as do all games and media
the viewing angles are also quite great
and are a vast improvement from previous
generations of this screening and the
signature brightness of an IPS display
shines through here as well though Sony
looks to stay ahead of the curve with
the release schedule they fall slightly
behind here with the performance aspect
or as we will be hearing the term
Snapdragon 805 more and more these days
Sony has opted for the Snapdragon 801
for their latest smartphone backed by
the adrenal 330 and 3 gigabytes of RAM
now for those of you who want to be on
the absolute bleeding edge this might be
a bit of a deal-breaker but it actually
makes a little difference in the overall
experience all but the most recent and
most power hungry games for example
still performed wonderfully and getting
general tasks done is still very much
possible especially with the Xperia U
eye which keeps things simple minimal
and dust fast jumping between
applications and the recent apps screen
is still a breeze for example making
multitasking as easy as it can be while
it certainly would have been nice to see
the latest and greatest processor on the
Xperia c3 it will still be a top-tier
performer for the vast majority of you
out there hardware has always been a
strong point for Sony whose offerings
often bolster the media experience the
front-facing speakers return and they
are the great performers they have
always been though there are some
options in the sound settings that could
make them even better and louder the
default settings at max volume still
allowed for enjoyment even in the very
noisy environments I tested them
I can't explain I feel oh the only thing
I thought was missing in the sound
Department was the inclusion of the
noise cancelling headphones that were
included with the Xperia z2 but I have
been told that they are available in the
box according to region
so I guess my version just didn't make
the cut what also didn't make the cut
was an IR blaster so you won't be using
the Xperia z3 like a remote but all the
other connections did come back here
like for example and of see also make
sure you get the right version for your
network my d6 65 3 was unable to connect
to t-mobile's high-speed Internet and
instead was only able to get the 700
bands for 18 T the internet was still
pretty fast but the constant search for
signal and reception took a massive blow
on my battery life making true battery
testing kind of tough to do but speaking
of battery a 3100 milliamp our unit is
bolstered by the usual suite of sony
battery saving options so under the
correct circumstances longevity should
be at a very comfortable high my
constantly searching radio antenna did
help drain the battery life in around 13
hours unfortunately with pretty high
usage but with at least the stamina mode
on it trucked on for close to a day and
a half due to the pretty stellar standby
time and in the end we can't forget that
all this goodness is protected by IP
certification making this one of the
sturdiest phones out there right now
it's clear that Sony has a lot of faith
in their camera optics because this is
the same package found in the original
Xperia z1 a 20-point 7 megapixel shooter
that is capable of some enormous
pictures also brings a lot of modes for
fun and creativity modes like a rfect
background defocus and time shift give
you the tools needed to get a myriad of
shots plenty more are available for
download should you need dedicated
cameras for services like Evernote and
vine 4k recording is also available but
huge file sizes might make you opt for
the already good quality 1080p shots
unfortunately I still found the same
issues here as I did in previous
iterations the 20.7 megapixel resolution
is only accessible when in the full
manual mode after which you can get to a
16 by 9 aspect ratio by jumping down to
15 point 5 megapixels or the superior
auto default of 8 and while the superior
auto does a pretty good job of catering
the settings to the shot such features
are not available in the 20 point 7
pixal sighs now that being said the
picture quality is still very
satisfactory the 20.7 megapixel shots
obviously capture more data but for far
less noise the 8 megapixel shots of the
superior auto will likely please more
though there is a propensity here to
overexpose the photos this actually
works in its favor when considering
low-light shots the experience III
yielded more usable low-light shots than
plenty of its competitors especially due
to its capability to go as high as
12,800 ISO and if anything using the
dedicated camera button to easily
activate the app and then shoot makes
the Xperia camera still one of the best
tactile experience is currently
available though minor upgrades across
the board have proven noticeable and
welcomed the software aspect doesn't
quite fall under that category but
that's not really a bad thing the Xperia
U eye returns with essentially the same
look and feel as before with its
decidedly stock like elements and a few
additions piled on top if there is one
thing that we are always happy about
with the UI it's that the simplicity
keeps things really fast and the
interface seldom slows down due to being
overworked nonetheless you get the
general home screens the app drawer the
notification drop-down with the quick
settings shade and the small apps that
are found in the recent apps screen if
you want some small overlay tasks done
the main additions include Sony's
specific applications like the Walkman
album and the unlimited media buying
experience
connectivity to a Playstation 4 is
possible allowing for streaming from a
console to the phone on the same network
it's a feature I'm very excited to use
but unfortunately I haven't bought my
ps4 just yet and the main addition here
is the life log which is a robust but
somewhat disconcerting data logger that
tries to record your entire life
everything from internet usage camera
usage Facebook usage to even your steps
and distance traveled are recorded and
illustrated by an avatar on the screen
you can literally look back on the life
log and see what you have done in the
past day or even beyond I wouldn't blame
you for being worried about just how
much specific data is being monitored
but I will admit that for anyone out
there that likes to journal or just have
logs for everything from fitness to data
usage it's an interesting tool that will
later connect to Sony's variables for
even better data recording ultimately
there's a lot to like about the Xperia U
I simply because there isn't a whole lot
of stuff to wade through Sony continues
to put faith in their user interface and
we continue to like what we see the Sony
Xperia z3 is currently available for the
unlocked price of around five hundred
twenty nine dollars putting it squarely
in the realm of flagship smartphone in
both value and price but it is also
available for pre-sale on t-mobile in
the states right now its main
competitors include the other flagships
including the Samsung Galaxy s5 and the
HTC One m8 especially considering it
comes with a comparable performance
package and so there you have it to the
next iteration of the Xperia flagship
line perhaps available too soon for some
people's taste and for a number of
people out there the upgrades might not
fully justify what could be a costly
upgrade but for the veteran Experian the
c3 provides just enough to keep things
fresh and does so very successfully in
the design department especially for
anyone that hasn't had the Xperia z2 the
c1 before it or even the Z before that
the Xperia z3 is another example of our
phone manufacturers continuously trying
to perfect what has already been a
pretty good experience
we can't fault Sony for having faith in
a product that already showed us what
they were made of two versions ago and
we certainly can't blame them for
continuing to make that experience even
better now thank you very much for
watching this review of the Sony Xperia
z3 I do think it is a great offering
from Sony but it falls just short of
really matching some of the top
competitors out there but I'm actually
really excited to bring you the other
releases by Sony as well the Xperia z3
compact of which you can see an unboxing
already on the side and the z3 tablet
compact
I'm excited mostly about the compact
because it does pretty much lie in a
class of its own being a small offering
with the big performance so keep it
tuned here for that and even more from
