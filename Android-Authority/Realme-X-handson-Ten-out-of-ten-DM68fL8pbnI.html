company real meat has made quite a name
for itself in a very short amount of
time the brand new real meat ex is their
10th smartphone which is fitting to the
name and is kind of crazy to think about
considering they've only been around for
12 months the real me ex isn't just
another phone from the Chinese brand and
even though it's technically a mid-range
phone it's got some nice flagship like
hardware up its sleeve
the most obvious one being the pop-up
selfie camera we've seen quite a few
companies go with the pop-up selfie
camera approach at this point but it's
still a fairly new and exciting way of
implementing the front-facing camera the
pop-up mechanism is located in the
middle of the phone's top edge and
really says it's been tested for over
200,000 cycles and is covered in
sapphire glass just in case you're
concerned about its durability
it'll also auto retract to protect
itself if you happen to drop the phone
with no exposed front camera to deal
with this means that the real me ex is
able to maximize the space on the front
it's got a really large display that's
protected with Gorilla Glass 5 and an
impressive 91.2% screen to body ratio
this is also real Me's first phone ever
to use an AMOLED display which is a
really nice and welcome improvement
another way that real me has been able
to achieve a front that's pretty much
all display with thin bezels is by going
with an N display fingerprint sensor now
most n display fingerprint sensors
aren't great but they've been getting
better and this one seems to be pretty
good in the short amount of time that
we've spent with it so far it has rarely
failed and feels pretty quick to back up
the impressive hardware the real me ex
comes with a solid foundation of specs
it's got a Snapdragon 710 processor and
comes with four six or eight gigabytes
of RAM and 64 and 128 gigs of storage
options although this will probably vary
by region the phone also comes with a
headphone jack and they finally made the
switch to USB see after using micro USB
on all their previous devices the USB
type-c port supports oppa's vogue 3.0
fast charging technology to quickly get
you back to a full charge and it has a
nicely sized battery to go along with it
the software out of the box
is Android 9pi with oboes color OS 6.0
which I know some people aren't a fan of
due to its iOS like nature but I
personally don't really mind it wrapping
back around to the cameras really
quickly the front-facing camera is a 16
megapixel sensor and uses pixel binning
to help with low-light the rear camera
is the 48 megapixel Sony sensor which is
the same sensor that's in the oneplus 7
pro and the Oppo Reno so we're expecting
the real me X to produce some good
quality images although we'll have to
wait and see till we use the device
further to really find out the real me
X's camera will also be equipped with AI
scene recognition for up to 16 different
scenes and objects and video recording
has been upgraded to support 960 fps
slow-motion video at 720p and 120 fps at
1080p so that pretty much does it for
our hands-on of the real me X let us
know your thoughts down in the comments
below and check out the written article
as well if you want to know more about
the real me X also stay tuned for our
full review on the real me X in the
coming weeks thanks for watching and
I'll talk to you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
