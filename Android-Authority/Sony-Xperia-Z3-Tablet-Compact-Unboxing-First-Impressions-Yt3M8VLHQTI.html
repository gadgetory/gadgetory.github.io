going to give you a quick unboxing of
the Sony Xperia z3 tablet compact here I
have the Sony Xperia z3 tablet compact
it's a long name and the use of compact
not sure why but maybe it means it's a
bigger tablet coming out soon who knows
we shall see so the box itself there's
not much to it it's fairly minimal the
box has the image of the tablet itself
with some key information on the side
and some generic branding on the back
the back shows the key features of the
tablet and you can see that it comes in
black and white there are some cool
features about it firstly the triluminos
display secondly the ex reality engine
which enhances contrast and sharpness
but not to mention also allows
visibility and bright sunlight I'm
interested to test this out in the full
review why I am really keen on are these
here one is the IP 65 68 certification
but not to mention the support for
high-end audio but more uniquely it's
the PlayStation integration so to the
box itself inside the box we have the
tablet inside the box we have a micro
USB cable
we have a charger finally we're left
with some documentation not too
surprising so and we're left with the
tablet itself there we go just going to
take this off now if we go around the
device we can see that it has a standby
button the volume rocker the 3.5 mm
audio jack and around the other side we
have the magnetic pins for various
accessories now tucked away on the
various slots around the device we have
the expansion slot the flap comes off
relatively easily this supports up to
128 gigs of micro SD card storage this
isn't bad for extending the storage and
the life of your tablet on the bottom we
have the flap for the micro USB charger
again they come off relatively easily
and as flimsy as they are they do serve
a good purpose and that purpose is the
IP 65 68 certification time to remove
the rubber here we go nice so like I
said before this device is a really
pretty one it has front-facing speakers
here at the top and at the bottom with
the front facing camera there is nothing
else on the front panel itself apart
from the logo around the back it's a
nice soft touch plastic with minimal
markings on the back it just has the
brand the model and the N mark logo this
is the NFC symbol and it's not often
seen here in the UK it doesn't attract
fingerprints easily which is quite nice
it feels quite nice too it also has a
real phrasing camera which sits just
under the back panel so hopefully that
means it won't get scratched easily all
in all I think the device looks quite
nice really nice actually it's quite
light in comparison I have my Nexus 7
here and you can see the comparable size
difference alright guys let's go ahead
and turn this tablet on
so you should know that the z3 tablet
comes with Android 4.4.4 so I'm just
going to scroll through the introduction
and select the language you may notice
the sounds and I quite like them you'll
find the same on the ps4 the Vita and
others Sony devices just going to speed
this up
we're ready to go in typical Sony
fashion things are quite smooth quite
Airy quite spacey it's the effect I've
been going for with their UI I'll be
exploring this and all of Sony
integration in the full review
specifically the PlayStation app which
I'm quite excited about my overall first
impression of the device is good the
screen out of the box is quite nice it's
nice and bright it's saturated but not
overly so the device itself is quite
thin and light with what I find it a
pretty sexy design the colours and
buttons or the tablet have a nice
tangible feel I'm excited to see more
the tablet the full review so take it
easy guys stay tuned to Android
