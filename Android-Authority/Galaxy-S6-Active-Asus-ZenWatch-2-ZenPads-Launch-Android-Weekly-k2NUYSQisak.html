brought to you by domain.com now like
many of you I grew up watching Star Trek
dreaming of the day that I could say
computer the Android at the bar said you
could show me my old ship let me see it
insufficient data please specify
parameters but now we can do that with
Google now or shall I say hound sort of
start off let's talk about the sound
hound much like google's voice assistant
that is baked into android activating
sound hounds new app can be done by
using the phrase okay hound as you can
see from the video here hound has the
ability to listen and respond to
casually phrase sentences and deliver
information in a card-based layout that
will help you get your correct answer
and like we've seen another voice
assistance hound can give you
information on the weather directions
local searches news photos and web
searches of course the power of sound
hound app is built right in what makes
hound stand out from google now is its
ability to respond to casual phrases and
sentences like this what's the monthly
payments on a million-dollar home what
is the down payment hundred thousand
okay using a down payment of $100,000
what is the mortgage period 30 years and
the interest rate is 3.95 percent okay
using a mortgage period of 30 years in
an interest rate of three point nine
five percent your monthly mortgage
payment is four thousand two hundred
seventy dollars and eighty four cents
what if the interest rate is 4.2 percent
on the down payment is twenty percent
okay using an interest rate of 4.2 will
percent in a down payment of twenty
percent your monthly mortgage payment is
3912 dot fourteen cents to use the new
service you'll need to head over to the
hound sound website and request an
invite now next up is for all you galaxy
s6 lovers who are a bit more sporty or
perhaps just klutzy the full
specifications of the galaxy s6 active
have appeared on Samsung's own official
product website there are a few notable
changes from the specifications rumored
earlier namely that the galaxy s6 active
features the same two thousand five
hundred and fifty million power battery
as the regular s6 not the rumored 3500
million
battery the fingerprint scanner is also
listed among the handcent sensors so
perhaps Samsung has found a way to
integrate the scanner into the raised
home button unfortunately there's no
mention of a microSD card slot it
features a 5.1 inch super amoled quad HD
display that's 2560 x 1440 it has an
octa-core exynos 7420 s chipset and has
32 gigabytes of internal storage with
possible microsd card expansion the
camera is a 16 megapixel rear facing
camera 4k shooting recording optical
image stabilization and a 5-megapixel
front-facing camera now you a sous fans
out there will be very happy to know
that asus has been busy with some
serious launches and let's start with
his Zen watch to the Zen watch 2 is
available in two sizes the bigger one is
the same size as last year with a 41
millimeter face and a 22 millimeter band
while the smaller edition is a 37
millimeter with an 18 millimeter band a
su seems to have taken to heart
criticism about its wearables being too
large for many users the displays are
OLED and protected by a 2.5 d Gorilla
Glass 3 while the processing tasks are
handled by an unnamed Qualcomm chip the
news n watch features a crown on its
side which is supposed to feature some
sort of functionality though asus has
not specified exactly what to expect yet
the device features better water and
dust resistance now at ip67 and a new
magnetic charging system that replaces
the cradle system found on the originals
n watch speaking of charging battery
life should be greatly improved asus
claims that the zen watch 2 will last
three to four days on one charge now a
few years back asus used to have the
very best in android tablets and they're
not giving up the fight yet the zen bad
series comprises a seven-inch 8 inch and
10.1 inch models each one complete with
their own set of accessories coming with
LTE variants asus share the details
about the 8 inch zen pad and zen pad s
therefore will focus on those two today
starting with the zen pad s 8 point oh
this is a high-end offering featuring a
metallic design and a crisp IPS display
as with most asus tablets and
smartphones the zen pad s 8 point o
features intel inside the 64-bit intel
atom zedd 3580 coupled with four
gigabytes of ram should
sure top-notch performance as we've seen
on the zenfone 2 the regular zen pad a
point where everything about it screams
budget though asus is trying to make it
hip and sexy with the inclusion of a
leatherback that can be switched with a
whole range of special accessories you
can switch covers just to change the
look of the tablet but you can also add
some functionality specs of the zen pad
8.3 processor 1 or 2 gigabytes of ram 8
or 16 gigabytes of expandable storage
and a 1280 x 800 IPS LCD display a 5
megapixel rear camera with a 15.2 watt
hour battery and Android 5.0 lollipop
now a su shared no news on pricing and
availability but if their history is any
track record it will be some time before
we actually see them in stores now a few
weeks ago we had a t-shirt contest where
we asked viewers to come up with an
Android related domain name and you know
the winner would win a t-shirt and the
one I chose was the droid you're looking
for calm priceless I haven't been able
to get it out of my head why because no
domain name extension tells your story
with the same level of trust as a.com
or.net domain name dot com and.net

head up i tried to get an invite for the
