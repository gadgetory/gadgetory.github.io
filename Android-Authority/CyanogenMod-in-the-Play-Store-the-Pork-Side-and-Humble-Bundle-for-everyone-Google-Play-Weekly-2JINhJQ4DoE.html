Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Google Play weekly
episode 6 we've had a lot of big news in
the google play store this week there's
a brand new angry birds blackberry
messenger is finally getting released
and cyanogenmod is releasing an
application to the Play Store very soon
we got all that and a lot more so let's
get started the first bit of news we'll
talk about this week is the new angry
birds called Angry Birds Star Wars to
the game comes packed with a bunch of
new features a new story to play through
and the opportunity to play on the pork
side the game plays like your classic
Angry Birds title so pretty much
everyone knows how to play this game
already the defining difference or
in-app purchases that give you access to
over 30 new characters and the chance to
play as the pigs to go after the birds
last week we showed you a beta tester
trying out the new blackberry for
Android that should be the last beta
test that you ever see because the app
is scheduled for lease sometime today or
tomorrow and we'll be rolling out to
multiple platforms over the weekend the
news has been a little inconsistent some
reports state that the app will be
available friday with iOS versions going
out over the weekend others say the app
won't drop until Saturday so if you
don't see it today just try again
tomorrow it'll be interesting to see if
this can compete with SMS and hangouts
on Android if you did a comparison of
the YouTube app from itself six months
ago you'd notice that there has been a
staggering change because the YouTube
team has been really busy making the
appt a lot better in November there will
be another feature added in this time
it's offline viewing it is still a
couple of months off which kind of sucks
but when this update drops you'll be
able to download videos for a short time
to watch offline I want to emphasize
short period of time because this won't
give people carte blanche to download
videos for permanent storage just a
little time to watch them when they
don't have internet access android and
pc gamers should be pretty familiar with
humble bundle by now the service puts up
about half a dozen games that discounted
right all in the name of charity they've
released an android app it's in beta but
it's also available in the Play Store
for download right now the key word here
is beta so you can expect a few bugs and
errors here in there it gives you an
interface you can use to download games
you've purchased and it delivers
notifications to let you know of
upcoming humble bundle deals if you're a
gamer this is going to be a must have
app really soon because everybody loves
cheap
games and giving to charity in our last
bit of news this week cyanogenmod went
corporate and you know what good for
them it's a good move for them and a
good move for the android community as a
whole it'll be really exciting to see
the kind of stuff they have coming
through the pipeline really soon on that
note let's talk about an app the
scheduled for release in the Play Store
relatively soon it'll flash cyanogen mod
on your phone for you we don't have all
that many details about the app just yet
what we do know is you'll be able to
download the app and companion app on
your computer using the tool it will
install cyanogenmod to your device the
idea is to make installing CM a painless
and simple procedure that even the tech
illiterate can follow you best believe
we'll be reviewing this one when it
comes so who wants to check out some
trending applications as usual if you
want to try these apps out the links are
in the video description if there is
anything android really needed it was a
grandma with a gun and gangster granny
fills that void perfectly you play a
sweet looking old lady who breaks out of
prison kills people blows things up and
a bunch of other felonies it's a
reasonably fun game at a reasonable
price which is all the motivation I
usually need fans of Tron may get a kick
out of our next game called neon City in
this game you tilt your phone and press
jump buttons to avoid obstacles it's a
fun little time waster and you can
upload your scores to an online
leaderboard to see how well you do
against other people realtime strategy
games on android have been getting a lot
better and pocket fort is a great
example of that it's about as classic as
a realtime strategy can get you build
your forces mind resources and fend off
attacks from the bad guys it has quick
gameplay and it's easy to master so
beginners shouldn't have a problem with
it let's face it after you leave school
you forget most of the things you
learned there quizlet was made to help
you remember those things it lets you
download user-generated flashcards that
cover a range of subjects it's a great
way to keep that brain working our last
trending app this week is another time
waster called my car salon pro in this
game you fix cars and earn money so you
can upgrade your garage and fix more
cars that's about all you can do and
many may find it boring but if you need
to kill a few minutes this will do it
once again I'm Joe Hindy the android
authority app guy feel free to subscribe

this show check out some of our other
ones you can find the written companion
to this video along with the social
media links in the video description
