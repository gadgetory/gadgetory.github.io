Android authority
now that Galaxy S 9 has been shipping
and people around the world are
receiving their units now some people
are receiving phones with the cork on
the snapdragon 845 in it and some people
are receiving devices with the X nos 9 8
10 in it and the question is there
Samsung promised lots of performance
gains particularly with the
single-threaded performance and this is
what we're trying to find out did
Samsung actually deliver on those
promises well let me explain ok so just
a quick refresher the X naught 9 8 10
has got is an octa-core processor 64-bit
ARM processor with 4 cortex a 55 calls
for the energy efficiency and for
Samsung in half Tillet m3 calls for the
high performance it also got a are Mali
G 72 18 core GPU now in a very rough
kind of way
both the Snapdragon 805 and the X North
9810 are of very similar performance
certainly in dates their uses you're not
going to notice that one is fast and the
other in terms of the CPU power but when
it comes to just doing looking at those
numbers doing those benchmarks let's see
what we were able to find out now I run
the standard benchmark 10 to 2 Geekbench
3 B marker sword and I've plotted some
graphs that compare the s9 with a
Snapdragon in it to the s9 with an X
knot in it and I think you're going to
find the result quite interesting so the
first test is GFX bent Manhattan running
at 1080p
off screen it doesn't matter what
display is attached to the CPU and you
can see here that the Snapdragon 845
manages 61 frames a second very
respectable score there but the X naught
9 8 10 only manages 47 frames a second
now of course 47th ranked second on such
a high performance test is very
reasonable is better than what we were
getting last year but clearly here the
the GPU in the Snapdragon 845 is
superior and in fact we're gonna see
that shown in time and time again over
the next few benchmarks so now looking
at the t-rex test poor so part of GFX
bench also running at 1080p
off screen this time the difference
wasn't quite so remind
150 frames per second for the snapdragon
146 frames per second for the Exynos of
course the t-rex test is a lot of a less
demanding test because you can see who
were looking at double the frame rate on
both devices to start with so this is a
less of a challenging test and they're
both getting good scores but still the
snapdragon out ahead there and then when
you look at 3d mark which really is a
very kind of heavy GPU test we can see
that the Snapdragon 805 scored 4695
and quite a way down is the X nori 3343
so again a big marked difference there
in the GPU performance
now the antutu test is a combination of
GPU and CPU so let's see how these two
devices fare in antutu well as you can
see here the snapdragon 845 scores two
hundred and sixty six thousand five
hundred and fifty nine
compared to two hundred and fifty
thousand five hundred and twelve on the
Exynos nine eight ten so again clearly
the the eight forty-five had better and
two two scores it's not as a big
difference as we saw with some of those
other GPU benchmarks but still a big
lead there a big win from the Snapdragon
I really hope you're enjoying this video
if you are like to remind you there is
now a separate gary explained youtube
channel and there i cover lots of
technology outside of mobile so if
you're interested go over to youtube.com
slash gary explains and i'll see you
there now where samsung really promised
a performance again was actually in the
cpu not in the GPU in fact they were
claiming forty percent greater
performance for multi-core tests and an
up to double performance for a single
core test so iran geek major on both
devices using its single core test and
it's multi core test and let's see what
results i found
well now the table is completely turned
as you can see the x and all scored
three thousand seven hundred and forty
seven which is way ahead of the core
comm which called 2426 now they were
promising a doubling of performance
compared to the m2 no the m2 that's the
process he finding phones like the note
8 or scoring around 2004 it's single
score test so we would be expecting
numbers of around 3,900 maybe 4,000 now
they've actually given us an 85 percent
increase in performance which is
significant it's not what they were
advertising but it is a significant
increase in performance is remarkable
and it does blow the Snapdragon version
here out of the water but remember this
is pure CPU testing and a similar
situation here with the multi-core tests
we didn't get to go over 9000 on the
multi-core test we've got eight thousand
nine hundred and forty six and that's
compared to eight thousand one hundred
and sixteen for the Snapdragon so still
the winner there is the Exynos for CPU
performance both single core and
multi-core and it is significantly
faster than the Snapdragon 845 but in
the GPU Department the eight forty-five
seemed to be the winner so what does
this all mean well what it means is
actually in an average their usage if
you're doing G email and then you're
kind of playing a bit of a games and
then you're watching some video that
you're just mixing it up then you're not
going to notice the difference on any of
these things if you're going to be
playing games then it looks like the
North American market is doing much
better by having the Snapdragon if you
are doing just general usage maybe
webpage Brett rendering and those kind
of things and it looks like the
excellence is going to be a bit faster
but as I said though these scores are so
high particularly to compare them to
phones of not just last year but maybe
let's say two years ago these are just
so high now that you're not going to
notice any difference but if you like
being kind of a you know a benchmark
fanatic you like to see what those
numbers are then this has shown us and
they've made big big inroads in single
core performance on the Samsung and I
hope that next year in the m4 we're
going to see even bigger performance
leagues and maybe in terms of CPU
performance the Samsung devices can get
close to or even beat what Apple are
doing in terms of GPU well things are
looking pretty healthy on both platforms
