you'll think of a smartphone came
straight out of your bathroom closet
ready tackle those hard water stands in
your tub hey guys John Belasco here with
the Android thority and I'm doing a
quick hands-on look with the Acer Liquid
zest plus jokes aside this is a
mid-range phablet of sorts it was
announced at acer's press event in New
York City today the only new smartphone
to be exact while it might be hard to
take it seriously it definitely will
turn heads with it's under $250 price
point even with the affordable cost
attached to it there's really nothing
striking with the design called
conventional call it mundane it's purely
a plastic constructed smartphone and it
looks much like the other lower to mid
range handsets we've seen in the liquid
series the plastic construction doesn't
give us confidence at all but it helps
to give it a lightweight feel in the
hand but seriously it's nowhere remotely
close to achieving the same level as
today's high-end devices for the price
you're getting Android 6.0 marshmallow
you mostly stock affair for the most
part it also features a 5.5 inch HD
screen a mediatek mt6752 good bytes of
RAM 16 gigabytes of internal storage a 5
megapixel wide-angle front camera and a
tripod 13 megapixel rear camera that
sounds fancy and all but it's just
Jorgen for a camera configuration that
consists of laser phase detection and
contrast detection focusing so we check
it out quickly and it seems to cut down
on the focusing time now though it's
tough to gauge its quality previewing
the snapshots through the phone screen
they look good but it has trouble
casting and neutral exposure with high
contrast scenes again this is just all
preliminary stuff shutter books however
will be loaded with full manual controls
on board being a mid ranger there's
always going to be that reluctance about
making it a daily driver just because
it's unknown if ESO will bring it up to
speed with the latest Android experience
lastly this phablet is packin a whopping
five thousand milliamp hour battery now
that's quite a hefty towel if you ask
any
so we can only hope for better than
average results with its battery life as
obnoxious as the name might be this
phone certainly has its appeal as a
backup the sub 250 price point is kind
of tough
given the handful of sub $200 phones out
there already saturating the market on
the opposite end the spectrum if you're
looking for substantial savings for a
daily driver this more than makes it up
with its low price so if you guys want
to learn more about this handset you
