a lot of ways the newest entry in the
note line is just a further perfecting
of everything that came before it
hey Josh McArthur manager at Horry
what's going on everybody and this is
the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 versus the
Samsung Galaxy Note 2 the recently
released Galaxy Note 3 not only takes on
a different design philosophy than its
predecessor it also takes on a different
approach to its main defining feature
the s-pen we start off with design in
which the updates to the Galaxy Note 3
mark a pretty new beginning for Samsung
the note 2 carried on what became a
long-standing tradition of Samsung's
material choice glossy plastic and thus
was a pretty finger print prone and at
times quite slippery device in the hand
it also took on a more rounded look much
like the galaxy s3 only its larger size
with that 5.5 inch screen thus made it
one of the first popular bigger
smartphones nonetheless everything else
is pretty much classic Samsung with the
button layout and the removable back
cover the s-pen on the note 2 had to
take on the rounded shape of the phone's
back which meant that its rear portion
had to be contoured to that curve and
thus could only be inserted in that one
particular way fast forward a year and
Samsung finally decided to change the
game up a little bit the first thing you
notice about the note 3 is the new
material choice the back cover is no
longer of a glossy plastic and is now
textured and it tries to mimic leather
especially in the etching found around
the edges the general shape is also no
longer pebble-like and is generally more
decisive with its flatter sides and
overall flatter profile this new
material solves the fingerprinting
problem and makes your phone that looks
pretty great even after some heavy usage
the Bund layout is still the same and
even if the screen is larger than the
note 2's by 0.2 inches it is just about
the same footprint as its predecessor
while becoming even lighter in the hand
it's surprisingly nimble for a big phone
the s-pen was also given the same
treatment it is lighter than before but
also has been given a more symmetrical
shape so it doesn't have to be oriented
one specific way to be inserted into its
slot it's hard to find pretty much
anyone these days who are still into the
glossy plastic for the most part people
have grown tired of its repetition
that's why the note 3 marks such a nice
beginning because even if it's not
technically that drastic of a change it
is still very welcome overall it just
feels so much better and helped solidify
it as a truth of
for the note line the display experience
has beefed up from the note two with the
note three ascending to the standards
that we've gotten used to in the top
tier the note 2 has a 5.5 inch 720p
display that was a good performer and in
plenty of ways still is the signature
Samsung saturation was definitely a
factor but also showed the capabilities
of the Super AMOLED display for many
people this screen meant much easier to
read material and a good media viewing
experience now compare this to the next
evolution the Super AMOLED pentile
display of the Galaxy Note 3 has been
brought up to a full HD 1080p experience
and is among one of the best screens
available on a smartphone today despite
an increase to 5.7 inches in size it
handles just about as well as its
predecessor due to its similar footprint
which is a great feat saturation levels
of the Super AMOLED screen remain pretty
high but in this new version of TouchWiz
these color preferences are actually
customizable the higher pixel density
makes for everything from text to media
fit even better on the large screen
making it seem like a bloated TouchWiz
was made for the size of the screen
pretty much no matter how you put it
together you know three display
experience is just so much better than
was found on the galaxy note 2 while the
note 2 display isn't terrible even by
today's standards it just isn't as good
as the new hotness we continued the
trend of the evolution with the
performance section it's no surprise
that the Galaxy Note 3 gets the highly
upgraded specs have you been released
one year later than the note 2 which
came with the Exynos quad-core 44 total
package clocked in at 1.6 gigahertz the
Mali 400 MP and 2 gigabytes of RAM this
is definitely still a respectable
package even today and performs quite
well any lag or stutter that was or is
still proceed on the note 2 could be
just as much an issue with the older
version of TouchWiz as it may be with
the processing package for plenty of
users today the Galaxy Note 2 continues
to perform the way they need it to
reliably more than anything so its
abilities to get work done is far from
in question but then we get to the
Galaxy Note 3 which basically wins the
spec war today by having the current
best package while offering even more
than the competition this version of the
smartphone packs a Snapdragon 800 the
processor clocked in at a whopping 2.3
gigahertz and is backed by the also
updated Adreno 330 perhaps the most
jarring change is the inclusion of three
gigabytes of RAM which is a first for
the Android space all of this power is
necessary for the new S Pen
functionality but
so for the sheer multitasking that the
note 3 is capable of personally I have
yet to encounter any lag rest order that
truly slowed me down and with an updated
TouchWiz I have only found a little bit
of slowdown one apps needed to load
information during their initiation
once again the note 3 simply Trump's its
predecessor by being the true next step
for the note line while the note 2 might
still be great for people who don't
demand too much from their s-pen enabled
smartphone what the note 3 offers is
just very difficult to dismiss at their
core the key elements that make the
Galaxy Note line attractive to users
remains in either device the removal of
that cover still implies removable
batteries and expandable storage of
which the note 3 begins at 32 gigabytes
while the note 2 began at 16 in the case
of the note 2 it was all about
popularizing the s-pen which went from
being a niche tool to becoming a part of
the multitudes of users experiences
while many people use the note 2 without
even touching the s-pen it still became
part of the general lexicon for every
user the note 3 would then be the next
step forward for the s-pen and it truly
is but then the game changed somewhat
when the galaxy s4 came into the picture
Samsung put so many new navigation
features via sensors and extra add-ons
that many wondered if the note line
would benefit from them as well their
wishes were granted the note 3 includes
not only the s-pen enhancements but also
benefits from all of the same sensors
that originally came in the s4 this
includes everything for air gestures air
view the IR blaster and even measuring
your general surroundings with s-health
while we'll get into the s-pen
enhancements more in a little bit all of
these non s-pen additions make one thing
very clear Samsung knows that you may
not use the s-pen and if you don't here
are all of the extra ways you can use
your Galaxy Note 3 when it comes to the
camera the Galaxy Note 2 continue the
tradition initially started by the
galaxy s3 whose optics were quite well
received this 8 megapixel shooter is not
the kind of talk to your offering we're
used to seeing anymore but that doesn't
keep it from still pleasing its users
even one whole year later the app itself
is pretty simplistic with icons taking
up a fair amount of space in the
viewfinder and aside from best modes and
HDR there aren't too many extra
functions that add to otherwise
classical smartphone photography
experience much like with the sensors
and the hardware the release of the
galaxy s4 also conspired the camera
upgrade in the galaxy note 3 the 13
megapixel shooter in the note 3
is very much like the one found in the
galaxy s4 right down to the app features
such as that new drama and eraser modes
are available in the note 3 allowing for
plenty of options for any shutterbug in
video anyone that really wants to get a
great enhancement can look to the
Snapdragon version of the note 3 for 4k
video capture overall the quality of the
Note 3 camera is a proper update
trumping the note 2 not only in its
picture sizes but also in the level of
detail and color reproduction again the
note 3 just performs better than its
predecessor all of these upgrades are
expected in a new version and so far the
move forward is felt throughout finally
we have the software in which at first
glance you may not immediately see the
difference this is because TouchWiz
by-and-large has not really changed and
quite frankly is in need of a generally
updated look that being said the
TouchWiz in the no 2 definitely looks
more bloated due to the lower resolution
of the screen and without the S 4's
navigation additions it is largely a
classical experience added on to by the
s-pen speaking of the s-pen its main
usage in the note 2 was in general
handwriting and pretty simplistic
clipping if you wanted to use the s-pen
for more contextual tasks a quick
gesture brought up the quick command
which required the use of symbols in
order to trigger specific functions
essentially all of these functions were
reimagined in the Galaxy Note 3 which
not only added in the navigation
features but also looks much better on a
1080p display while everything
definitely looks bigger on this 5.7 inch
screen they aren't overly or obnoxiously
large keeping everything easy to view
without becoming eyesores s-pen usage
has become much more intuitive with the
addition of the air commands menu
triggered by pressing the pen button
while hovering over the screen action
memo is essentially the updated version
of quake commands only all handwriting
can be recognized and then plugged into
the appropriate application clipping has
also been enhanced with the scrapbooker
and even the screen rights which are
only a couple more of the enhancements
that are baked in for all that the s-pen
can do on the Galaxy Note 3 you can see
my future focus video basically
outlining it all ultimately TouchWiz
doesn't look like it has changed a whole
lot but in the Galaxy Note 3 it is
capable of so much more and that is
where its appeal definitely is it should
be obvious by now that the Galaxy Note 3
is just leaps and bounds better than its
predecessor but all of that also comes
with a price while the Galaxy Note 2 now
a year older can be found for $500 or
sometimes less on
and $1.99 on two-year contracts via US
carriers the galaxy note 3 gets the much
more premium price of $800 unlocked and
$299 on contract and so there you have
basically it comes down to the price for
your choice what this verses has taught
us however is that if you go for the
note 2 because of its better price you
really do get what you pay for the note
2 does provide a good big smartphone
experience still and decent s-pen
functions but clearly it pales in
comparison to all that the note 3 is
capable of personally I do think that if
you can put down the extra money for the
note 3 it is worth every single penny
because it can do a hell of a lot and
even better you can do them pretty damn
well as always thank you guys very much
