images of the supposed Galaxy Note seven
we've got them now these are some
seriously poor quality images that were
leaked but we've done our best to tweak
them to give you the best peek into the
supposed Galaxy Note seven now these
were leaked earlier this week with
another batch of no less than six images
that appeared on a Chinese microblogging
site Weibo now this is the black onyx
version of the note 7 and we're seeing
it from every angle although it does
look like it's been shot with a 1.2
megapixel camera so from all the leaks
that we've gotten over the past several
weeks it does look like the phone is
shaping up to be as expected what do you
guys think let me know in the comments
below the note 7 will be officially
launching this August second looking
forward to it now unless you've been
living under a rock for a while you must
know that the world has gone stupid
insane with a new ball game called
Pokemon go but we're going to talk about
maps that help you find more rare and
prized Pokemon in the game and first up
is polka crew and for all you fellow
Canucks out there you know what we're
thinking oh alright are you ready now
this is a site that isolates your
current location and shows you a list of
Pokemon near your region documented
caches are charted and you can keep
track of how far and away they were each
Pokemon is assigned a quote chance of
sighting rating and the database keeps
up with what times of day every species
appears to be present go catch them all
is clearly the strongest pokemon map in
this list pokemon sightings are
catalogued with accuracy and sorted into
categories of common uncommon rares
ultra rares and epics a wide array of
sorting options are available to you and
the map updates to suit your preferences
with tiny icons of the Pokemon you're
looking for what could possibly be the
downside well as it stands go catch em
all is only available in the Boston area
however we hope that it will expand in
the future but as it stands only
residents of Massachusetts can make the
most of this powerful poker tracker now
let's talk polka mapper and yes I'm
pronouncing it polka mapper and not poke
mapper because
polka mapper is just fun and it isn't as
robust as go catch them all but it still
offers some pretty decent tracking
sorting options are fairly limited
however and users will note that in
rural areas there is a lack of coverage
in fact even larger towns have pretty
scant data with this app however it is a
worldwide map so in spite of lacking
filtering capabilities with the other
two maps it may be the truly only
worldwide option now how many of you are
still Sony Xperia fans like me well
image is supplied to GSM arena by tips
to reveal what could be the successor to
the current experience like ship the
xperia x performance it looks like Sony
is finally exploring new directions when
it comes to product design the device in
the images purported to be the sony
xperia f8 331 features flat sides on the
top and bottom with rounded sides the
2.5 d glass on the front flows into the
curve design of the phone and overall
the industrial design is reminiscent of
a flattened tube look of a certain Nokia
Lumia phone if you remember that like
the Xperia Z performance the phone in
the images features front-facing
speakers many of you are going to love
that and the bottom of the device
reveals a USB type-c port the xperia f8
331 could be sony's first phone to use
the new standard which is becoming
increasingly popular with Android
manufacturers unlike Motorola though
Sony isn't ditching its 3.5 millimeter
jack and seeing the device is relatively
thick that would be hard to justify
