handy the Android authority app guy most
people are still struggling with their
battery life and we're always looking
for ways that we can help you out so in
this video we're going to take a look at
an application called smart battery by
bitdefender like the other BitDefender
apps smart battery is a very simple
application to use it does most of the
work for you and all you have to do is
configure the settings to your taste
what this app does is change your
settings to save you the maximum
possible battery it does this by
allowing you to configure a whole bunch
of settings such as Wi-Fi mobile data
brightness sync Bluetooth screen timeout
audio volume and auto rotate you can
then configure a nighttime setting and a
low battery setting that will squeeze
every moment possible out of your
battery once you configure it you hit
the Settings button and activate this
creates a profile there are a few
pre-built profiles for you to use if
you're lazy like me but you can also
create about as many custom ones as
you'll ever need so how do you use this
app as the name implies you can use it
to help you save battery life now I know
there's really not much here that you
can't do on your own the problem is that
doing it all on your own is incredibly
time consuming and you probably don't
want to tick all those settings on and
off manually all day long and that's
where this app is truly helpful
automatic the process so you can just
fire and forget so here's what we liked
for a battery saver app this is among
the easiest that we've ever used the
settings are easy to understand and the
interface is set up really well the app
does actually work it's not as dramatic
as saving you days of battery life but
in our testing we did get a couple of
extra hours out of each charge the app
is free which means there's no reason
why you shouldn't try it out and here's
what we didn't like so much there isn't
anything really new here turning down
the brightness turning off the mobile
data these are all time-honored battery
saving tactics it's nice this app
handles it all for you in an
easy-to-understand manner but again most
of these things are already known lastly
there are no route offerings we know
this app is meant for the general
populace but there are some great
battery saving functions for route users
and it would have been nice to see those
options incorporated into an easy
interface like this one at the end of
the day this is an application that does
in fact work it won't work miracles and
increase your battery life by days but
with some aggressive configuration you
can easily save a few hours and that can
mean the difference between charging at
dinner time and making it to the end of
the day if you're having battery
problems do yourself a favor and try it
out it's free
so it can't possibly hurt once again i'm
