is Clayton Youngberg coming at you from
your number one source for all things
Android as always Android Authority comm
so today we've got a review of the XO
skins product now this is a screen and
body protector for the Samsung Galaxy s3
and get these on XO skins comm we'll go
ahead and take out the contents of our
packaging here you can see we do have
our XO skins right here front and back
plenty of them and then we've got our
installation cards the air bubble
removers here plenty of those as well
and then we've got our application
solution so anyways these are our
instructions basic just across the board
for all screen protectors of course you
need to clean it you remove the
protectors and then you spray the
application fluid making sure to remove
all the air bubbles with a squeegee card
so anyways let's open some of these up
I've got the pebble blue galaxy s3 we've
also got our marble white galaxy s3 on
deck just to show you some of the
differences anyways these are our
backing covers and then we've got our
fronts right here we're gonna be using
our darker colors on the darker color
samsung galaxy s3 just you can't see as
many of the gaps there's oftentimes
there are some gaps when installing
products on the back of the samsung
galaxy s3 so many ways we've got a red
one which looks awesome we've got a blue
one and we've got a black one now these
are all carbon-fiber esque and they're
gonna protect from scratches maybe even
a little bit of impact if you drop your
phone and then we have some really nice
screen protectors here and we've even
got a clear backing for the Samsung
Galaxy s3 let's just get started we're
gonna go ahead and slap our black
backing on the samsung galaxy s3 as
always we're going to want to just
remove the oils the fingerprint residue
from the back with a nice little
cleaning cloth and then my trick to
installing things like this I always
remove the product and then I set it
back down halfway on this wax paper that
way you can actually manipulate the
product with your fingers down here
without
getting any of the sticky residue on you
or you know removing the adhesiveness of
the product and now we will just line up
the ports here as you can see there's
even a convenient cutout for the carrier
branding on the galaxy s3 that's kind of
funny they thought of that so we've set
it there make sure we just work out all
of the air bubbles we can use our
fingers and we can use the provided
squeegee so I'll just use my fingers for
right now and we just work all the air
bubbles out and we'll remove our wax and
then just drop the product down should
we don't there we go get it around our
edges and see our micro USB is perfectly
anyways we've got a nice crab carbon
fiber backing on there we'll take our
galaxy s3 can pop it on see it looks
great I like the look of the carbon
fiber especially on their black or I
mean the blue samsung galaxy s3 dark
color schemes are always my favorite we
have our nice cutouts for the LED the
camera and the speaker we do have our
carrier branding it covered up our
Samsung Galaxy s3 there but it's not
obtrusive at all you can't really feel
the edges there there but you're not
going to be able to just accidentally
rip this off it's pretty set on there so
anyways guys we'll just install the rest
of these on the back of our samsung
galaxy s3 and resume the video when I do
that so we're gonna spare you the long
installation we've got our EXO skins
installed on our samsung galaxy s3s here
our white ones rocking the red skin and
then our blue ones rocking the blue one
the blue one blue looks awesome
and then the white one with the red just
looks flaming hot now we got our cutouts
the Sprint is a little off and then I
installed it just a bit off but this is
just a precaution because you know not
everyone's an expert installer I know
I'm not so oftentimes you might get just
a little bit of edge there but that's
always concealed by a nice case now
there's plenty of cases that do have you
know clear backings like this and if you
just wanted the EXO skins for aesthetic
purposes
this looks really awesome you've got
your carbon fiber just like that they
all still fit in the case now they're
just fine for protection on their own I
wouldn't suggest putting the case over
the exo skins like this oops looks like
my case is gonna be backing up
but anyways yep they're really strong
they apply nicely they're durable
they're very adhesive to the back of the
samsung galaxy s3s and they just look
great I love the look of the different
colored carbon fiber skins up you're
gonna get complements from the ladies if
you're later you're gonna get
compliments from the guys so go ahead
and install these guys they're just
really awesome
anyways stay tuned with Android
