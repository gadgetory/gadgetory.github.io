handy the Android authority app guy
after the intro we'll be taking a closer
look at Google's latest app called
Google keep Google keep as an
application where you can take notes
note-taking has always been a popular
activity with smartphone owners as you
can keep a veritable refrigerator box
worth of sticky notes on your phone
Google keep aims to bring that
functionality in a nice clean interface
with a few nifty features at its core
Google keep is a very simple application
where you can store your thoughts notes
memos and other nonsensical bric-a-brac
that really isn't suited for anywhere
else there are five ways to leave
yourself a note the first way is using
the quick note feature you just put down
the cursor in the text box at the very
top and jot yourself down a quick note
this is helpful for when you have a
sudden thought and want it written down
real quick the second way is your
standard note-taking it opens a box
where you can enter just about as much
text as you want this is helpful for
longer more involved notes when a quick
note just won't cut it during testing we
were unable to find a character limit so
you could write a novella in here if you
wanted to third is the list note you can
use this to write out a list of things
it can be a grocery list a to-do list or
pretty much any other kind of list that
you can think of this kind of note is
helpful to anyone who well needs to make
a list of something fourth is the voice
note it opens the voice search box and
lets you dictate your note out loud this
is helpful for when you're in an
environment we're typing as a hassle
during our testing the dictation was
pretty accurate and it's definitely one
of the funnest ways to take a note
aside from dictating the note it also
saves the audio so you can listen to it
later an extension of voice notice to
use the voice search on your phone
simply start by saying note or take a
note then say whatever your note is it
will take this info and save it as a
note to Google keep this is definitely
one of the best features because it lets
you take a note within seconds and you
don't have to open Google key first the
final way to leave a note is to use a
picture note when you use this
note-taking method it opens up your
camera you can then take a picture of
whatever you want to take a note about
you can also add some text if you want
to this note-taking method is great
especially if you need a visual aid or
want to remember what you saw when you
decided to leave yourself that note
there are some other features for Google
keep if you want to rearrange your notes
you can long press a note and move it
around once you're done with a note you
can either delete it or archive it so
there are some built-in ways to manage
your notice once you have a bunch of
them perhaps its best feature is its
with Google Drive if you log into your
Google account and go to
drive.google.com backslash keep you can
find all the notes you took via the
mobile app you can also leave new notes
there and they'll be synced to the
mobile app so no matter where you access
it you can leave new notes and
everything will stay synced overall we
quite enjoyed Google key it's a
wonderfully simple way to take notes and
stay organized it doesn't have all the
features of other note-taking apps but
it has enough of them too we're using
Google key doesn't make you feel like
you're missing out the only caveat is
that there is no hand writing
note-taking method so people with
devices that have a stylus or people in
general that use a stylus won't be able
to take notes that way no big deal
though with the variety of ways to take
notes the Google Drive and Google search
integration and the clean simple and
friendly interface anyone who wants to
take notes with their phone or wants to
start doing so could do a lot worse than
they give Google keep a try once again
