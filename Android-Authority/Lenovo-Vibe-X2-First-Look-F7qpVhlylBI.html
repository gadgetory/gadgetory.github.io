authority what's going on everybody and
here we are at the Lenovo booth and it's
actually outside which is a nice change
of pace because it also makes making
some video a little bit easier but this
bright daylight will make it even better
for me to show you this the Lenovo vibe
x2 now we have a 5-inch screen right
here at fhd that's full HD 1080p display
at 441 pixels per inch but what I really
want to show you in this special edition
of the phone is first of all the great
design that's right here with this
multi-tone on the side which really
gives it a very stylish look but if I
bring it over to the back there is the
bamboo now this is a very special bamboo
that they put on here and again it's a
special edition of the phone now the
bamboo on here can only be harvested in
the spring in China and that's when they
get the various type of types of bamboo
that would be put on these particular
devices now they're really excited to
put out these bamboo versions of the
phone which is awesome but all in all I
do think that all of the colors and you
see one of them in the background there
is the red one all of these colors do
make a very nice device right here
especially with this multi tone color
that we have on the sides right here and
also of course on the bottom as far as
the display goes we do have the five
inch display right here at 1080p
resolution and it will show the UI very
well on the vibe x2 right here now the
operating system is largely about the
same as it was in previous vibes but
there are there have been some tweaks
and further performance enhancements in
here as the processing package on here
is now the mediatek mt6752 tour that
actually has some extra tools for taking
selfies as is a bit of a trend nowadays
here I fo with a lot of these phones
alright so we're taking a look again at
the screen I did want to change the
exposure up a little bit so you can get
a better look at the actual screen
itself so here it is again a 5 inch
1080p display but when we turn on the
phone and get into the lock screen this
is the new lock screen that they have
for us you'll notice all of these
bubbles that are around here if you hit
the time right here what will happen is
all of these bubbles will appear with
the most recent or most use applications
that you have been
using now it's a list that it's
generated by the phone itself knowing
your particular habits let me get back
to it real quick and the larger bubbles
are going to be the apps that you use
the most and then the smaller bubbles or
ones that you don't use quite as often
so we're able to just click one of the
bubbles to unlock and we got into the
settings right here we're taking a look
at the settings and also a little bit of
the customization that you have here in
the character section of the options but
yeah that is one of the main main
changes when it comes to the operating
system now just kind of going around we
have the recent apps screen right here
that looks very nice and we have a menu
right here that does have a theme
available if you so choose to change up
the look but the last thing I'll show
you is a feature inside of the camera
and that's of course when it comes to
the selfie mode and now obviously
selfies are a big thing right now and
I'm already right here you can see me on
the camera already but right over here
we have the ability to turn on a bunch
of different ways of of activating the
shutter now there is the tap on the
screen just to be ordered to do so or
you have a three-second timer which is
really awesome and it's pretty standard
but it is really good to have when
you're using when you're trying to take
selfies but also these two right here
which is blink and sign blink will allow
you to trigger the shutter by slowly
blinking into the camera and the hand
sign will actually let you do peace
signs in order for you to trigger the
shutter but we do have the three-second
timer they're probably one that you'll
use most often but this is just the
interface right here with even the
beautify mode here on the bottom which
is pretty standard on these Chinese
market phones to be able to soften up
all of the features inside of your photo
especially when it comes to your own
face so yeah that is the vibe x2 this is
the brand new phone from Lenovo that
comes with not only the type of power
that you would need from it with the
mediatek processor the octa-core
processor even with a big little
architecture but also we have this
wonderful design here that really I am
kind of enamored with the entire device
itself actually feels quite light and
it's just nice and flat all around just
small edges around here that around it
but the spam boo bag is just really
really nice and not to mention this
two-tone color that we thought red a
multi tone color that we have right here
that really stacks upon itself all of
the different colors of the device and
makes it looks
super attractive so keep it into Andhra
thority we're going to have even more
for you from the Lenovo booth including
their tablet and the vibe z2 and you can
keep it tuned here for even more
coverage here because we are your source
