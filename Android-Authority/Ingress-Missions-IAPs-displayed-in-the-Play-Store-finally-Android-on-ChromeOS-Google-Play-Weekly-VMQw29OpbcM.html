Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Google Play weekly this
week it's all about the big game updates
some Google Play changes involving
in-app purchases and a whole lot more
Android apps news so let's get started
first up this week is some good news
google is finally adding in-app purchase
prices to the Google Play Store it's
something practically everyone has been
yearning for since in-app purchases
became a thing apple's app store has had
it for quite a while so it's nice to see
google adding it in as well where does
that google be rolling it out starting
at the end of the month so by this time
next month we'll all be able to see
those in-app purchase prices before we
download the applications / a an
unofficial hack was released late last
week that allows you to install android
apps on Chrome OS so far the hack is hit
and miss because some Android apps work
and others do not it also requires a
little technological know-how so you
really shouldn't try it out unless you
know what you're doing however this is
very promising because it shows that
Chrome OS is getting closer and closer
to having full android support and it
appears that it's just a matter of
working out some bugs at this point
chrome OS users should be very excited
for the future report around the old
grapevine is that fruit ninjas receiving
a pretty substantial update pretty soon
the game is four years old but it's good
to hear the developer still wants to
support it the new update will overhaul
the menu interface to something a little
bit more modern there also be new
gameplay features for instance when you
select a dojo or a specific weapon there
will be bonuses and such to make things
more interesting it should be rolling
out sometime in the next month the
latest humble bundle is out now and you
guys know how much I love a good Humble
Bundle this time around there are
actually three tiers you can pay
whatever you want and get cube ma'am one
and two bridge constructor playground
and Thomas was alone if you beat the
average which is about six bucks at the
time of this video you can get at least
four other games with more coming soon
if you go over $11 you get surgeon
simulator and anomaly defenders if you
bought all of these games separately it
would cost you one hundred and five
bucks so this is a great deal if you're
looking for some new games last up this
week ingress released a huge update that
totally changes how you play the game
the vanilla portal hacking stuff does
remain intact but Nancy collapse has
released a new feature called ingress
missions the new feature allows you to
partake in you
ested missions that will take you on an
adventure each mission is created by
actual ingress users so it's really for
the people by the people if you've been
looking for a reason to pick up ingress
and give it a shot now would be a good
time to do it so who wants to see some
trending applications as usual if you
want to check any of these applications
out you can find the links in the
written companion which is in the video
description below first up this week is
an application called topeka this is
actually a Chrome OS app that has been
turned into an Android app it features
full-on material design which looks
outstanding unless you hate color it's a
quiz game and so far people seem to like
it do beware that it is a little
us-centric but it is totally free so it
can't hurt to try instapaper is a
mixture between evernote and pocket it
lets you save web pages to your device
for offline reading but it does so in a
text-only minimalist kind of way so you
can read things without being distracted
the app used to cost money but it has
now gone free with in-app purchases so
if you want to try it out you can do it
free of charge Star Wars commander was
recently released and it's essentially a
clash of clans clone but with Star Wars
characters and it's made by disney as
clones go this one is pretty good but we
probably wouldn't be talking about it if
it didn't contain the words Disney and
Star Wars it's free to play and there
are some extra things you wouldn't get
in clash of clans so if you want
something just a little bit different
check this out beach buggy racing is the
latest game out of vector unit which
also does the Riptide GP series racing
games which weight android authority or
big fans of in this car style racing
game you'll race against friends or
alone on large colorful tracks and as
usual you get powers to smite your
fellow racers it's free to play with
in-app purchases and I am of the mind
that everyone should have at least one
vector unit racing game on their device
so why not this one last and certainly
not least this week is Leo's fortune the
game made its return to headlines this
week effort / that's twice from 499 to
299 if you haven't picked this game up
yet it's one of the best platformer
adventure games out there with wonderful
graphics and fun gameplay there aren't
any in-app purchases and this really is
a good deal for this game if you want to
see the latest and greatest in android
app news and review simply head on over
to android authority calm click on that
little menu
thinking at the top and check out the
application section if you want to talk
more about applications we have a forums
