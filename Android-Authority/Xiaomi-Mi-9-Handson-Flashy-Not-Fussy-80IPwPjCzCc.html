launched Xiaomi has announced its
successor than me nine there's three
main things to know about the me nine
it's added a third camera on the back it
has some impressive new charging tech
and no there's still no headphone jack
let's talk design real quick there's
Gorilla Glass 6 on the front and Gorilla
Glass 5 on the curved back panel which
has this lovely holographic vibe to it
the diffracts light regardless of
whether you get the black blue or purple
version there's also a transparent
addition we'll discuss more in a little
bit there's a new good extend display
fingerprint scan under the six point
three nine inch AMOLED screen there's a
couple of shortcuts - if you long press
the fingerprint scanner but for now
these are locked up QR codes search and
add calendar event but hopefully xiaomi
will let you remap those in a future
update speaking of remapping the
dedicated voice assistant button on the
side will default to Google assistant on
the global version but you can remap it
to your voice assistant of choice me UI
is just as you would expect so we won't
cover it here but we do have a full
review on the work so keep an eye out
for that to come out during MWC now
let's talk cameras the top on with the
decorative halo is a 12 megapixel 2 X
optical zoom lens and the middle one is
the new 48 megapixel Sony I MX 586 it'll
default to 12 megapixels thanks to pixel
benningfield better low-light
performance but you can manually switch
to 48 megapixels in the settings for
those super detailed shots the bottom
lens is a super wide angle 16 megapixel
sensor with barrel distortion correction
and all three lenses on the back are
covered by a sapphire glass up front
you'll get a new 20 megapixel F 2.0
aperture selfie camera and plenty of AI
bokeh the me 9 will also suggest
switching to the wide angle lens on the
back if it looks like you're going to
miss capturing your entire subject via
AI scene recognition now I mentioned
that new transparent edition earlier
which is actually what it's called
there is no me 9 Pro this year or
Explorer edition just a me 9 transparent
edition which once again opts for
decorative internals that you can see
through the glass back panel dispersion
is currently only scheduled for release
in China and will come with 12 gig of
ram and 256 gig of storage the blue
black and purple versions destined for
global markets will only come in 6 gig
of ram and 64 gig of storage or 6 gig of
ram and 128 gig of storage options
xiaomi says that depending on globe
demand it may release the transparent
addition outside China so if you're dead
set on one be sure to hit the comments
and make your opinions known other specs
you need to know are these Snapdragon
855 dual 5 G's support and it'll also
have NFC Bluetooth 5 and a 3300 milliamp
hour battery
speaking of battery the me 9 comes with
new charging tech Jeremy is calling
charge turbo using the 27 watt wired
charger it'll take just over an hour to
get to full battery capacity and yes I
did say 27 watt wired charging the
charge turbo also supports a new 20 watt
wireless coil in the me 9 this means you
can get a fully charged battery
wirelessly in an hour and 40 minutes you
won't get one of these in the box like
you did with the me mix 3 but Jamie says
it'll retail for well below 30 US
dollars once you include local taxes and
so on
Charmy also has a new 10 watt wireless
charging battery pack and a charge turbo
in car charger with a sensor so it opens
up and clamps down on your phone
automatically that's it for this quick
hands-on but hit the comments and let us
know what you think of the me 9 as well
as whether you want the transparent
Edition to come to you a local market
also keep an eye out there because
that's where we'll be sharing pricing
info as it becomes available and keep it
locked to Android authority comm for
more on Jamie's 5g plans because we are
your source for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
