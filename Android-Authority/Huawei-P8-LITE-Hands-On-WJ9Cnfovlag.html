Andrew authority and budget smartphones
are becoming more and more affordable
and easily accessible but they've also
gotten better a lot better and we've
seen that from a couple OMS all right
here in 2015 and Huawei is looking to
get in on the action with their latest
smartphone that they've announced here
in New York this is your first look and
hands-on of the Huawei p8 Lite so we've
already taken a look at the original p8
which came out a couple of months back
and as the name might suggest this is
essentially a scaled-down version of
that the p8 Lite retains the same design
language as vp8 with its flat
rectangular design but instead of metal
the p8 Lite is entirely made of plastic
it's still unibody and the plastic
construction is most likely to keep
costs down but in the hand the p8 Lite
still feels very well put together it's
also pretty thin at 7.7 millimeters with
some narrow side bezels that makes the
phone easy to use in one hand the
plastic is mostly smooth with just a
slight Ridge texture on the backside
that helps a bit with a grip there's
also a gold frame with a faux brushed
metal finish that extends a bit beyond
the front and back panels to give it a
more elegant appeal the power and volume
buttons are on the right side where
they're easy to reach and the remaining
ports are in their typical places with
the 3.5 mm jack up top and microUSB on
the bottom flanked by a speaker and a
microphone on the front is a five inch
LCD display with 720p resolutions so it
doesn't exactly stand out amongst the
crowd but it can still get the job done
the screen is a good size for people who
don't want a gargantuan sized smartphone
and at five inches it keeps the pixel
density at a respectable level that most
content still looks fairly sharp colours
appeared nice and vibrant and the screen
seemed to get reasonably bright during
our short time with the device
internally the p8 Lite comes with the
Snapdragon 615 and 2 gigs of ram again
no real surprises here but if it's
anything like other Android smartphones
being powered by the same chip the p8
Lite should handle the majority of
everyday tasks just fine including
gaming
and the 2 gigs of ram will be enough for
casual multitasking but will most likely
be easily bogged down with heavier usage
while weighs emotion UI is also one of
the more fluid Android skins out there
so you can expect an overall smooth
experience that isn't going to break the
bank 16 gigs of storage can also be
found inside the p8 Lite and it's
expandable via microSD for up to an
additional 32 gigabytes the p8 Lite
supports a wide variety of LTE bands so
it'll work on pretty much any GSM
carrier including t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T here
in the States
the camera on the rear is a 13 megapixel
sensor with a 5 megapixel front facing
camera for selfie lovers and Huawei is
promising optimal picture quality even
in low-light the camera software will be
very familiar for anyone who's used a
huawei device in recent past there's
just a few modes like photo video and
beauties that can easily be toggled
through just by swiping on the display
there's also an all focus mode which
lets you adjust the point of focus after
the fact which at this point in the game
isn't anything new and plenty of other
phones do it but it's still a handy
feature to have the battery is a 2200
non-removable battery which is the trend
with most modern day smartphones as
removable batteries are starting to
become a dying breed but the 2200
milliamp hour battery should still be
enough to get the p8 Lite through a full
day especially considering is only
powering a 720p screen it most likely
won't be a road warrior if that's the
type of phone you're looking for but
there are power saving modes built-in to
help you get the most out of your
battery life and software the p8 Lite
will be shipping with 4.4.4 kitkat and
Huawei says an update to lollipop is
coming but a time frame is still to be
determined emotion UI 3.0 can also be
found on board which isn't the latest
version of huawei skin but the
difference is between 3.1 and 3.0 are
pretty negligible all the features that
you might expect like one handed mode
easy mode and a built in theme engine to
tailor the experience to your liking or
all still present here while with UI
does change a lot of the Android
experience but it does so without
feeling blow
and many of the features are actually
more useful than gimmicky the best part
about the p8 Lite is the price it's
extremely affordable at $249.99
off-contract
putting it in direct competition with
phones like the idol 3 and even the
zenfone 2 it's also going to be very
easily accessible to many users and you
can purchase one for yourself starting
today directly from huawei zone outlet
and many other retailers including
Amazon the budget smartphone space is
getting crowded quickly and with while
we jumping in the ring your decision as
to which one to get just got that much
harder if you love the original p8 but
wished it was more affordable then the
p8 Lite is your best bet and it seems to
be pretty promising so far as always
