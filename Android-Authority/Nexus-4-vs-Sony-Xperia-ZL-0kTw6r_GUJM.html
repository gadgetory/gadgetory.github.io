2013 taking a look at what should be two
competitors going forward both are
packing Qualcomm's s4 pro technology 2
gigabytes of ram out of the box but the
main primary difference is that we're
looking at a 5-inch 1080p display on the
Sony Xperia ZL whereas on this one oh no
it's only a 720p display from LG so big
step down also internally on the rear
we're looking at the 13 megapixel camera
on the Xperia ZL with their Exmor RS
technology which incorporates HDR live
video accelerated recording so high
dynamic range process on the fly really
really advanced it's the latest image
sensor and sony has a lot of experience
in producing image sensors for a lot of
different companies no temper glass on
this one but it also has expandable
memory so you can throw a 32 gig card in
there other than that it also tends to
be a little bit thinner in the hand both
were very comfortable as you can see but
it's just really nice to have that
5-inch 1080p in such a tight form factor
they've incorporate they've used the
front-facing camera on the bottom which
is an interesting choice but their
engineers have told us that that's
because people tend to look at the
bottom when they're doing a video chat
so Morad I action sort of thing so
yeah so this is just really a first look
obviously this is a nexus devices of
reference device so it has the latest
and greatest that Google has to offer
whereas this at stoneys custom UI on top
oops but that's okay it's actually quite
fluid and because of the powerful
processing aside there's not going to be
any hiccups whatsoever no snow we're
done release date or pricing yet
obviously the nexus 4 is a really really
good value but if you're going contract
and you're looking for something new
maybe check out sony so this is the sony
xperia ZL and we're android authority
reporting live from to CES 2013</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
