Android authority and Motorola has been
killing it for the last couple of years
with their entry-level and budget
friendly smartphones so today we're
taking a look at their latest this is
your quick look and hands-on of the Moto
G 2015 at first glance the new Moto G
has a lot in common with a design of its
predecessors the shape is virtually
unchanged with the sloping rounded back
and the two speaker grilles on the front
and then all the buttons and ports are
in their usual places like 3.5 Miller
headphone jack up top microUSB port on
the bottom and the buttons on the sides
however the back of the smartphone
features a slightly different design
with a strip of plastic coming down from
the camera lens to a dimple in the
phone's back Motorola has also upped its
game when it comes to build quality and
it feels a lot sturdier in the hands as
a result the Moto G is now ipx7 rated
for water resistance which means that it
can withstand immersion in water for up
to one meter for 30 minutes the Moto G
pretty much retains the same form factor
from last year's model and has also kept
the 5-inch display size the display
resolution remains unchanged at 720p but
this is an acceptable compromise given
the handsets low price point the display
may not compete with full HD or q HD but
720p still provides a reasonably sharp
experience especially for a budget
device camera technology has seen an
improvement though the smartphone now
boasts a 13 megapixel rear shooter with
F 2.0 aperture and it's actually the
same camera as the Nexus 6 and alongside
that there's a five megapixel
front-facing camera which provides a
significant resolution improvement for
both the main and front cameras compared
to the eight megapixel and two megapixel
sensors from last year's model the paper
specifications for the rear camera
actually compares quite favorably with
higher-end handsets like the newly
announced oneplus 2 and will help keep
motorola at the head of the pack at this
price point other hardware components
include an ever so slightly larger
non-removable 24 70 milliamp hour
battery and there's still dual sim
compatibility with support for 4G
download speeds up to a hundred and 50
megabytes in terms of storage the Moto G
will be available with either 8 or 16
gigabytes of flash
memory which also determines the amount
of RAM that comes with the phone
powering the Moto G is a Snapdragon 410
processor which is a bigger upgrade to
the Snapdragon 400 that powered last
generations Moto G then the name might
suggest the GPU has also been switched
out for an Adreno 306 which should
provide a minor boost to gaming
performance the Moto G still features a
single gigabyte of RAM in the 8 gigabyte
model but this is bumped up to 2
gigabytes if you opt for the 16 gigabyte
version while 2 gigabytes would have
been better across the board the choice
is what allows Motorola to keep the
price point low now in my short time
with the Moto G I didn't notice any
stutter or lag while scrolling through
the interface and it's running a nearly
stock version of Android with android
5.1.1 lollipop and you do get a lot of
Motorola's features like the camera
twist to open up the camera app from a
sleep state and the Chop motion that
turns on the camera flash Motorola is
playing a fast global release for the
Moto G the smartphone will go on sale in
countries across the world as early as
tomorrow
including the UK US and India with stock
available through a selection of local
retailers and motor rolls online Moto
maker store color options include the
standard black and white and the back is
also removable so you can swap it out
with any other colour of your choice and
because it's available on Moto maker now
you can actually customize it just like
you can with the Moto X so you have a
lot more choices when it comes to
customizing the Moto G now just as with
previous Moto G handsets price is a
hugely important factor and the a
gigabyte Moto G will launch with a
retail price of 170 9.99 while the 16
gigabyte model will cost around 220
dollars but this has been your quick
look and hands-on of the new Moto G keep
it tuned here to Android Authority for
