brought to you by domain.com so big news
in the world of Android we heard rumors
of a Snapdragon 820 whatsapp comes to
desktop and CyanogenMod has lost its
bloody mind it said that Google has
quote tyrannical control over Android
courageous or crazy all right so let's
start off with the news of a new
Snapdragon Chinese leaker leaks fly
outed Qualcomm supposedly 2015 roadmap
which includes a number of new
processors we have yet to hear anything
about the leaked details each new CPU
and what it will bring to mobile devices
according to the document there are no
signs of a time frame for any of these
processors though other reports have
hinted at a late 2015
timeframe into the document we see the
upcoming processors listed as the
snapdragon 616 620 620 5 629 and 815 and
the Snapdragon 820 the Snapdragon 820 is
an octa-core 64-bit chip with an Adreno
530 GPU sweet but now moving on to news
about whatsapp coming to desktop with a
catch about a month ago we first heard
whispers of the possibility of a
whatsapp client for desktop and now the
trigger has officially been pulled the
new desktop oriented whatsapp experience
is presented as a web app for Chrome and
while it works rather well it's not a
standalone experience the whatsapp
client actually mirrors your
conversations and messages from your
mobile device and requires you to scan a
QR code on your computer via your phone
in order to get started what this means
is that if your phone isn't working it's
dead or it's off for example whatsapp
won't work on the desktop although it
would be nice that the experience wasn't
so tied to your phone this is still a
welcome addition for whatsapp fans
looking to utilize their computers
full-size keyboards in order to pound
out those messages faster than ever now
this last bit of news is big and has big
ramifications for all of us mobile
lovers Kurt mcasterisk an or CyanogenMod
and let's just say the man has been
rocking the boat Kurt Makassar is the
outspoken CEO of cyanogen incorporated
and has been in the news lately for
expressing some controversial opinions
on things like Google's quote tyrannical
control over Android or Samsung's
complete inability to build a decent
mobile operating system wowzers and you
got to admit the man has some stones
because now he's just upping the ante
and taking on Mother Google all together
at the informations next phase of
android event in San Francisco mr.
McCotter said the following I am the CEO
of cyanogen we're attempting to take
Android away from Google Earth to detail
his vision Makassar explained that Santa
Jan wants to provide a version of
Android that is opened down to its core
that partners can use to build highly
integrated services in a way that's not
possible right now with Google's Android
we're making a version of Android that
is more open so we can integrate with
more partners so their services can be
Tier one services he goes on to say that
we've barely scratched the surface in
regards to what mobile can be today
cyanogen has some dependence on Google
tomorrow it will not we will not be
based on some derivative of Google in
the next three to five years there will
be services that are doing the same
bullcrap with Android and then there'll
be others who are doing something
different that is where we want to be so
if you're a bit confused let me sort it
out for you right now
Android is technically open-source
anyone can download the developer tools
and use Android on their mobile devices
anyone anywhere but if you want to take
advantages of Google services Google
apps services like Gmail and Google now
and all that kind of stuff you have to
adhere to certain standards or
requirements that Mother Google States
and mother Google has tight control over
those things
so how would cyanogen create a
successful mobile operating system
without depending on Google services
well they wouldn't you see Santa Jean
has stated in the past that they want to
create their own
app ecosystem in fact in the next 18
months they say they're going to create
their own app store so they'll create
their own set of email apps their own
Google now so to speak so we'd have Play
Store the iOS store and CyanogenMod
store very interesting very brave and
potentially very stupid you see mother
Google likes to say don't be evil that's
their unofficial motto but you got to
remember how powerful Google is so one
of the most powerful corporations on the
planet of any corporation I mean it's
insane they can potentially wipe the
floor with cyanogen and they're not just
taken on Google they'll be taking on iOS
and Apple - it's pretty scary stuff but
hey it's exciting because if there's
another whole app ecosystem that's only
good things for consumers like you and
me exciting what do you guys think let
me know in the comments below now if
there is any chance of cyanogen being
successful at this they need to continue
to cultivate more hardware partnerships
with some of the Chinese manufacturers
that they have now and they've got to
continue to foster them it could be
really exciting I mean it's possible but
it's a long shot now you guys don't to
