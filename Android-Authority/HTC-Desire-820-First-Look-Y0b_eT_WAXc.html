Authority what's going on everybody and
here we are taking a look at the HTC
Desire 820 this is the brand-new what
they call mid tier hero in the HTC
lineup and it does seem to bring a lot
of what we already liked from the desire
816 and makes it an even more accessible
package and also future-proof which is a
term that they were using quite a bit
what we're seeing here is a 5.5 inch
screen now I will not be turning on the
screen exactly for this particular clip
because they did keep the brightness at
max here which makes it a little tough
to capture but the rates going there are
going to be some clips of the actual
interface at a different exposure but
what we can see here on the design is we
have a very nice plastic feel over here
it is going to be pretty smudgy around
and a little bit slippery but that's
fine what they were able to do however
was create a unibody design that was
also two-toned and in this case I have
the white and orange right here or
orange red if you want one the same that
does give it an interesting look there
aren't a lot of different colors of this
HTC Desire 820 that will be available so
you can really find all of the different
kinds that are good for you now as far
as the innards go now we do have the
display right here it's a 720p display
that has a 5.5 inch size and on the
front you can already see the boom sound
speakers that are available and that's
always a great addition when it comes to
HTC devices
and when you look at what is underneath
we have actually one of the first widely
available 64-bit processors available in
the Snapdragon 615 now the the 64
gigabyte processing that is available in
here as HTC says will allow this phone
to be future proof in order for this to
be able to handle Android L in the
future and also any future applications
and software that will be needed for the
future of Android now what we're also
looking at here is a
pretty good camera experience actually
one of the best ones that might be
available out there at least on paper
what we're going to be seeing is a 13
megapixel rear facing camera so we're
not necessarily getting those ultra
pictures from before but the
front-facing camera is the one that we
really have a big boost from what we
have here is an 8 megapixel front facing
camera which is pretty incredible in and
of itself and the ability to do a lot of
different types of selfies on the front
which I'll show you right now in order
for you to really get the best on the
selfie game so this is gonna be a great
one for all of the author if you love to
take self-portraits and it will be
available at the end of this month
available in plenty of markets and
available in college different types of
networks on the inside you have 16
gigabytes of storage and 2 gigabytes of
RAM and from there we still have all the
same great blinkfeed and wonderful sense
software or features that are available
in other agency devices already so
that's just a quick look this live look
at the HTC Desire 820 this is the mid
tier hero as they say this is sort of
the upper-middle range I suppose it's a
good way to put it of the of the HTC
family excuse me and we do really like
what we see here it continues the great
design of the 816 that we liked from
last year and gave a great review and
award of and it seems like they will be
able to continue that momentum with this
one here so keep it tuned here at
Android authority for all of our
coverage ayiva in Berlin once again I'm
here at the HTC launch event and this is
the this was the Desire 820</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
