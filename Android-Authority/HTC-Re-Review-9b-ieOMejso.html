Android authority and HTC is trying to
reimagine and change the way we take
photos but have they succeeded and will
people buy into it well that's what
we're here to find out with the HTC re
so you've probably heard all the jokes
by now that the relook slike an inhaler
or a kitchen sink faucet but that is
honestly the best way to describe it the
design however is pretty ergonomic and
taking photos and videos with it feels
quite natural in if it does look a
little silly it's small and lightweight
so it's very comfortable in the hand and
the compact size makes it fit pretty
easily in a pocket or bag the really
made of plastic so you might think it
feels a little bit like a toy but it's
very sturdy and with how small it is you
shouldn't have any problems with
dropping or damaging it taking a tour
around the rear you'll find a big shiny
silver button on the back that serves as
your shutter button with an LED light
built-in letting you know how much
charge is left
it also flashes red when taking photos
or videos and blue for slow motion video
on the front is obviously the 16
megapixel sensor which we will get into
but underneath that sensor is a
slow-motion switch for recording slow
motion video and further below that is
another LED indicator for those selfie
moments and a speaker on top of the re
is a single microphone and along the
bottom is your micro USB port for
charging and the microSD slot that
supports up to 128 gigs the slot is
covered by a flap to help keep the read
dust and water resistant with a rating
of IP 57 which means it is protected for
up to one meter for 30 minutes in fresh
and sea water there's also a standard
quarter inch tripod connection so you
should be able to mount it on most
tripods for more stable photo and video
but you want to be careful not to
over-tighten the read to a tripod
because with the plastic threads it can
easily be broken
setting up the re is a fairly simple
process and takes maybe a minute or two
once you've downloaded the app whether
it's through Google Play or the iOS app
store just follow the on-screen prompts
to connect your read you'll also want to
make sure you re is charged in Bluetooth
is turned on before doing so
once connected you are now ready to
start taking photos and videos but
before we get into that let's take a
closer look at the re app because
there's a lot you can do here besides
viewing sharing or deleting your photos
the re app also served as a viewfinder
that lets you remotely control the re4
taking photos videos and even time
lapses the viewfinder is extremely
useful for framing your shots and being
able to remotely control the re means
you don't have to exclude yourself from
group photos you'll also find various
camera settings like video resolution
photo resolution and on/off toggle for
ultra wide-angle and the ability to
backup your photos through your phone
Dropbox or Google Drive the app also
integrates with HTC Zoe apps so if you
like Zoe's you can create them with
photos taken with your read the star of
the show and what everyone wants to know
about is the camera sensor itself so
it's a 16 megapixel CMOS sensor and it's
an ultra wide-angle lens at 146Â° mini
you'll be able to fit a lot into a
single shot the camera defaults to 12
megapixels so you want to change that in
the camera settings to take advantage of
all 16 megapixels you are however
limited to a four by three aspect ratio
when shooting at full resolution which
seems to be the trend with a lot of
cameras these days that I'm not
particularly a fan of the best part
about the read is that it does all the
heavy lifting for you meaning all you
have to do is point and shoot and for
such a tiny pocketable camera the
picture quality is really impressive the
focus is always spot-on so photos are
very sharp colors are vibrant and this
camera has excellent dynamic range even
in harsh sunlight the camera does a
fantastic job of handling exposure so
you're always getting a well-balanced
and detailed shot without OES and an
aperture of only F 2.8 low-light
performance isn't the best the photos
certainly are usable but there is a
noticeable amount of noise and details
are very soft one of the most important
things when it comes to cameras that a
lot of people don't really talk about is
being able to shoot with confidence and
in order to do that you need a camera
that is capable of taking some
high-quality photos and that's even more
important with something like the read
because you're not relying on a
viewfinder
at a time but with the hundred and forty
six degree wide angle lens you don't
really need a viewfinder so basically as
long as you aim it where you want to
take a photo I would say that 95% of the
time the photo will come out exactly the
way that you wanted the 1080p video on
the read isn't quite as good as its
picture quality it's good enough for
quick clips or vlogging but the digital
stabilization doesn't work all that well
so videos look pretty shaky even if
you're just walking on the plus side the
microphone does a decent job of picking
up audio
you
you can also create time lapses and
slow-motion video at 720p I personally
like the time-lapse feature it's really
fun to use but the slow motion video
doesn't look quite as smooth and
dramatic like other devices capable of
slow motion video
since this is a device that somewhat
relies on your phone and it's going to
serve as a companion device you'd hope
that the battery lasts a really long
time on a single charge and with the 820
milliamp hour battery I would say the
battery life is really respectable
so HTC claims that you can get up to
1200 photos on a single charge and up to
an hour and 40 minutes of continuous
video and while I wasn't necessarily
able to test the accuracy of this claim
frankly because 1200 photos is a lot of
freaking photos what I can say though is
that I never had a problem with running
out of battery when it came to taking
photos
if I were to take a hundred photos
within a day it didn't even make the
slightest dent in the battery so it
really takes a lot to drain the read
just by taking photos videos on the
other hand will require you to charge
the read on a daily basis and possibly
even more depending on what often you
record video like if you're a vlogger or
something like that I did find the
standby time to be really impressive if
I didn't use it very often it would last
me a week on a single charge so overall
I've been really satisfied with the
battery life on the read you can pick up
the HTC re now through online retailers
like Amazon and stores like Best Buy for
$200 but as much as I like the read I do
think the price is a little bit steep
and if you already have a smartphone
that's capable of taking great-looking
photos you probably won't feel too
compelled to buy it but it does have
other advantages besides just taking
great-looking photos you can take photos
with it a lot faster than you can on
your smartphone you can create
time-lapse video and you can also use it
underwater but even with those
advantages I would still wait for it to
go on sale but if you do buy it for the
full $200 I don't think you will regret
it but that is going to do it for the
HTC read it's a very small pocketable
and portable camera that really
simplifies the photo taking experience
and it's a lot of fun to use and this is
obviously another attempt by
dc2 branch outside of the smartphone
market and they have a really great
product on their hands but for the price
it's not exactly an impulse buy so they
have a lot of convincing to do if they
really want people to buy it as always
