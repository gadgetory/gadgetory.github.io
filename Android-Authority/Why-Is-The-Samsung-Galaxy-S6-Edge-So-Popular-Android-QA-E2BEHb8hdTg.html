to you by harrys.com do you remember
what this was this was an image of the
once rumored Samsung Galaxy s5 of course
the s5 ended up looking like a band-aid
but look a little closer what is that a
distinctive edged or curved display is
it conceivable that Samsung had the
curved technology in the bank 2 years
ago and just saved it for the Galaxy s6
the things that make you say so exactly
what is it about the galaxy s6 edge that
has proven to be so popular just over a
year ago Samsung released the Galaxy
Note edge the first product to use the
new form factor the product was said to
be manufactured in limited numbers would
be released in select markets only and
came at a truly premium price point the
general public's reaction was not
exactly favorable and indeed when the
sales numbers came in they weren't
impressive less than 700,000 units has
been sold since last February the Note
edge which has exclusive features that
make use of the unique form factor has
largely been forgotten even if some
thought it was superior to the standard
note 4 on the other hand the s6 edge has
so few legitimate features that some of
us felt it wasn't worth purchasing yet
seemingly everyone is the note is aimed
at a fundamentally different crowd than
the s-line
it's obviously much larger both in terms
of screen size and footprint and it
comes with a stylus the s-pen and a
productivity suite custom-made to take
advantage of the accessory I think it is
safe to say that the king of phablets
the Galaxy Note or the Note edge is
primarily geared to harder core geeks
perhaps the issue here is simply one of
timing or momentum while Samsung
announced the Galaxy Note edge at the
same time as the note for the former
released much later than the latter
almost two months in some countries and
more in others it's conceivable that
many of the customers who would have
bought the Note edge simply didn't
because they didn't want to wait and
because the note 4 was largely the same
exact phone - the curved display on the
other hand the galaxy s6 edge was
announced and released simultaneously
with the standard s6 and thus customers
had a clear choice from the very
beginning perhaps had Samsung at least
provide
working samples of the note edge when
the note 4 was released customers could
have seen what was waiting down the line
and made a conscious decision to wait
while there are a fair number of people
act by the unibody seal design employed
by the Galaxy s6 edge it's arguably a
minority assuming such as the case it
would follow that the design of the
Galaxy Note edge while nice with the
metal frame was still just to Samsung
it featured a cheap plastic removable
back and generally wasn't viewed as a
truly premium phone
despite the semi metal make on the other
hand the s6 edge is a totally redesigned
phone in every sense of the word the
glass and metal make has eliminated any
trace of plastic the design is inspired
by those that came before it and still
looks fresh even TouchWiz itself has
been refined and toned down to be a much
lighter and brighter experience perhaps
a great deal of mainstream consumers
were truly impressed by the s6 edge and
its craftsmanship could the success of
the Galaxy s6 edge be an indication that
mainstream customers are simply tired of
traditional devices and are therefore
seeking ways that they can straight from
the pack the s6 edge also has a major
wow factor going for it that competing
flag ships like the iPhone 6 and HTC One
m9 simply don't if phones are now an
extension of the individual who owns
them it seems perfectly logical that
people want to seem as cutting edge
stylish and even ahead of the curve so I
will admit it I thought the whole curve
edge thing was a bit of a gimmick when I
first saw it but you guys seem to love
it and there's so much natural buzz
about the phone I mean people just want
to talk about it we found the need to
just do another show about the s6 edge
because there was that much buzz and
talk about it so let me know in the
comments below what you guys think how
many of you thought that it was going to
be a gimmick - and how many of you made
the connection that I did with this
rumoured image of the s5 maybe that was
a prototype or do you guys think let me
know I'm a hairy dude I'm like this
everywhere I can grow hair up here - I
don't because my wife is into the whole
doctor evil thing the point is this
hairy beast knows a thing or two about
