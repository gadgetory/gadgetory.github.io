meant to answer a lot of phone
enthusiasts problems motorola claimed
the phone collapse for two full days and
with this durable ballistic nylon or
metallized glass fiber reinforced with
Kevlar it would keep the phone from
feeling slippery to prevent it from
drops and falls and even though battery
life and durability didn't quite hold up
to our expectations the droid turbo did
manage to impress us but this year
motorola has made history with their new
Droid turbo and provides an answer for
an even bigger problem hello everybody
I'm crystal and this is Verizon's
shatterproof joy turbo - yes Motorola
claims this is a world's first phone
with a shatterproof screen it has a
Motorola calls moto shatter shield and
in our week of testing this we're
actually blown away because yes we'd
agree this phone screen is shatterproof
whether it falls from five feet facedown
on concrete skills across a hardwood
floor or tumbles down a set of stairs
the display just does not crack or
shatter so how's this possible while the
Moto Shadow shield works due to the
screen itself having five different
layers instead of Gorilla Glass covering
the display like most phones we have a
piece of plastic that covers a flexible
display so when the phone takes of fall
this display is able to absorb the shock
by bending instead of just shattering
along with this we have a dual touch
layer which is sort of for back up is
dual touch just in case the first touch
layer does indeed break you still have
another now having said all this does
that mean there were no consequences
from dropping the Droid turbo - well of
course not yes the screen does not
shatter but with that plastic piece
covering the display is prone to
scratching more so than we see on most
phones with glass panels of course you
start to see scuffs around the border of
the phone with enough hard drops and
finally the droid turbo 2 does not have
a certified impact rating so drop this
phone enough for my up you could very
well damage one of the components inside
however we dropped this phone more in a
week than the clumsiest person in the
world would in a year and the phone
still appears to be working perfectly
although we do have some scratches on
the display along with some wear and
tear on the sides
enjoy turbo to owners this shatterproof
display is not an excuse to treat your
phone like it has no feelings
moto shadow shield is there just for
those unlucky
moments sure you may skip the size or
damage some hardware just like you would
with any phone but you can be sure your
display will hold up just fine so does
all this create a bad viewing experience
for the screen well not really the 5
point 4 inch display is quite HD AMOLED
so right out of the box you'll notice
very vibrant colors and deep blacks it
looks very nice there does appear to be
more of a gap between the display and
touchable screen itself but it's
actually not that noticeable text is
quite sharp and colors seem to really
pop viewing angles are decent of course
in most AMOLED screens eventually
they'll start to rainbow when held at
sharp angles but for the most part it's
a great screen there are definitely some
small compromises given the shadow
proofing of the screen but we were
surprised at how well Motorola was able
to maintain a good viewing experience so
this revolutionary technology does come
with a bit of a price when it comes to
design a lot of you are mentioning how
the front of the droid turbo 2 isn't the
most appealing to look at and we'd have
to agree there's a lot going on in the
front with all these sensors cameras
logos and different size speakers but to
be fair our review unit was white which
makes things a lot more noticeable than
they would be on a black front panel
also that nasty verizon check mark
between the speakers can come off
because it's actually part of the screen
protector however if you're going to
remove this make sure you quickly buy
another perhaps without de Vries logo as
the protector is crucial to the shadow
shield technology we still have some
pretty large sized bezels on the side
and it's a pretty chunky phone at 9.2
millimeters but it's back curves up a
little and that remains mostly flat so
the phone doesn't Rock too much one on a
desk with the screen size of 5.4 inches
which isn't too large the phone does
feel a little more unwieldy than it
should be
but with all that great technology
coming together inside the droid turbo 2
it's more forgivable the back is where
the camera and flash live surrounded by
a metal border and that Motorola dimple
remains which creates a nice resting
point it's a little higher than the one
found on the back of the Moto X pure and
actually I think that makes it feel a
little more comfortable to hold I do
have small hands though so it all
depends on your hand size on top we have
our headphone jack and our SIM card slot
which doubles as an SD card slot so yes
the droid turbo 2 is capable of
expandable storage on the right side is
a volume buttons and power button has a
bit of a texture feel to it which makes
it easy to feel for
for the first time motorola is allowing
users to customize the Droid turbo to
their moto maker which is awesome it's
starting to look like no matter what
type of device Motorola makes it will be
compatible with moto maker so you can
choose between a soft grip which is
similar to the one found on the back of
the Moto X pure but it's a little softer
feeling and has a different pattern
pebbled leather that comes with a free
engraving and of course the ballistic
nylon the Droid turbo users love of
course the accent color is available to
change as well which also change to the
top speaker grille oh and remember if
you want to make this phone a little
more pretty definitely stick with that
black front inside the droid turbo 2 we
have a pretty impressive setup
Snapdragon 810 processor with an Adreno
GPU and three gigs of RAM it comes in
two storage options at 32 gigs and 64
gigs and once again Motorola is claiming
up to 48 hours of battery life with the
droid turbo 2 but this huge 3760
milliamp hour battery you won't find any
fingerprint scanner here and although it
looks like you have dual front-facing
speakers actually the only speaker that
creates sound when watching content is
the bottom right one which is
unfortunate but the sound it creates is
pretty nice very crisp and clear it gets
pretty loud too but at max volume some
heavy compression starts to kick in now
the softer experience is phenomenal when
it comes to any Motorola phone however
with the droid turbo 2 while still great
the thing that disappointed us was that
out of the box this phone is running
Android lollipop 5.1.1 and not Android
marshmallow given that this is a Verizon
exclusive Verizon will be playing apart
and how long it takes for marshmallow to
roll out and given Verizon's track
record it could be a while but besides
that the software is still great
the Droid turbo 2 runs near stock
Android with a couple of nice motorola
features that fans have always loved
like moto display that shows missed
notifications over black screen which is
even nicer on the droid turbo 2 with
this AMOLED screen although ok Google
Voice commands while the screen is off
is unavailable in lollipop motive oiss
is a great substitute as it does work
when the screen is off and can be
programmed to any voice command it takes
a little bit longer than okay Google as
motive or sees to translate your words
before since you over to Google Voice
but it's a nice feature to have the
twist to open the camera feature is here
along with the chop to trigger the
flashlight as well the near stock
software
mix with the a10 processor allows for
very smooth internet browsing and gaming
is great as well it's a fast and fun yet
simple software experience but once
again Verizon has to put their little
twist on it there's a lot of
pre-installed Verizon apps on this phone
along for bunch of silly games however
you can remove the majority of them if
you're familiar with the motor
experience camera well you can expect
the same thing here on the droid turbo -
a 21 megapixel rear-facing sensor that
does a great job
there's no optical image stabilization
so you'll need a steady hand mostly in
lowly lit areas but it shouldn't affect
outdoor images it takes great photos
colors look good not the most saturated
but more realistic in medium light it
does a decent job as well but in low
light some grain will begin to show
colors will lose their vibrancy and like
I said you're going to have to make sure
you keep a steady hand or your photos
will be blurry but in the end low-light
pictures look pretty decent the front
facing five megapixel shooter take some
great shots - with this wide-angle lens
it's easy to get everything in frame and
details look very good
just like on the Moto X pure we have a
front-facing flash which is a little
weird
in most situations you won't really need
it but in really dark areas it could
come in handy although it can be a
little harsh sometimes video looks very
good on the Droid turbo and it's also
capable of shooting in 4k like I said
earlier there's no optical image
stabilization but the software
stabilization does a pretty good job
overall it's a great smartphone camera
as long as you stay away from the dark
now besides that shatterproof screen
battery life is the other huge selling
point of the Droid turbo - with this
huge 3760 million power battery and
motorola statement of 48 hour battery
life we had high hopes for the Droid
turbo 2 and in moderate use of texting
all day taking some pics watching some
videos and surfing the internet for a
while we were able to get around five
and a half hours of screen on time which
for a phone with a quad HD power sucking
display that's very impressive
Motorola's 48 hour battery life claim
maybe the best-case scenario with low
use however the droid turbo 2 was
impossible for me to kill in a day so
every night I would go to sleep with at
least 40% of battery life
without plugging the phone in overnight
I would wake up with around 35% and that
collapsed me for almost half the day
it's a hard number to put your finger on
as every day is vastly different from
one another but on average I was able to
keep the droid turbo alive for around 30
hours with moderate use and standby
overnight now if you're a heavy gamer a
photographer or a big-time video watcher
you may have to find a charger before
the days over
but that's where Motorola's turbo
charger comes in handy
allowing 13 hours of battery life with
just a 15 minute charge now really this
phone is like the Moto X pure on
steroids same camera and software
experience with a groundbreaking
shatterproof screen and phenomenal
battery life however it may be a little
less attractive to some and is
unfortunately a Verizon exclusive which
will already put many consumers off and
on top of that the Droid turbo 2 comes
with a pretty heavy price tag although
there is a payment system in place with
Verizon xej agreement at $26 for a 32
gig and $30 for the 60 for the full
price that we're looking at is 624 and
720 respectively now there is a cool
little benefit that you get for buying
the 64 gig and that's the ability to
change your design within two years of
owning the device you'll get an entirely
new Droid turbo 2 which sounds great but
there's also a fee to do this it's a
pretty expensive phone and yes this is
the first phone in the world that
answers our biggest problem but it still
seems a little pricey it's a great phone
but unless you're somebody who's
constantly dropping your phone that
price may see or some users away well
