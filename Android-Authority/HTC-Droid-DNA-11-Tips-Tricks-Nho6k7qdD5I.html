Authority now if we look into the future
there are a lot of very cool looking
phones on the way but when you talk
about what's available right this second
the HTC Droid DNA is one of the coolest
phones currently available so what we're
going to do for you is today we're gonna
show you 11 tips and tricks to get the
most out of your htc droid DNA that's
right this list goes to 11
now the Droid DNA does an awful lot
right out of the box but there are still
things you can do to get more out of it
whether that means improving performance
getting better battery life or just
having more fun with your phone so let's
get started
with number one our first tip use best
shot now you may already be aware of
this tip but I was actually mocked by a
few fellow Android authority team
members for not being aware of it so I
figured I would save our viewers from
that very situation when taking a photo
just hold down the shutter button to
take up to 20 photos and very rapid
succession then you can either use best
shot to automatically select the best
photo for you or you can keep all the
photos and pick the best one yourself
number two change your lockscreen
now I'm not talking about a pin or face
unlock here
the HTC Droid DNA allows you to
customize what is shown on your lock
screen under settings go to personalize
then lockscreen style you can choose
from the standard wallpaper lock screen
to productivity which shows your
notifications to photo album weather
people
clock stocks music or even choose to
have no lockscreen at all number three
on our list turn off three finger
gestures if you're an HTC media link
user you might want to leave this
setting on but if you're not this option
will actually prevent other apps from
using three finger gestures at all so
you'll probably want to turn it off
under settings select display and
gestures and uncheck the box next to HTC
gestures now other apps will recognize
three finger gestures instead of just
HTC media link with tip number four we
return to customizing your experience
bike
creating custom scenes selecting
personalized under settings will allow
you to change a number of options such
as wallpaper your skin and sounds you
can save these to a custom scene rather
than overwriting an existing scene
simply hit scene then tap the menu and
hit new now you can change your visual
settings and even your home screen
layout then return to another setup
later on
simply by selecting a different scene
our fifth tip turn off fastboot now most
of the time you may want to leave
fastboot turned on as it does exactly
what you'd imagined it makes your phone
boot faster the problem is that it does
this at a price the best way to think of
it is like the hibernate option on a PC
your phone isn't really fully turned off
so you're not completely unloading
everything from RAM when you turn off
your phone if you want to make sure that
you're actually rebooting from a clean
slate go to settings then battery and
turn off fastboot now when you reboot
your phone you're really rebooting your
phone passing the halfway point at
number 6
flip your phone no don't flip off your
phone this little trick can do a few
cool things if your phone is sitting on
a desk and starts to ring at an
inopportune time just flip it over to
shut it up immediately
this same gesture also has a cool effect
in the middle of a phone call
flip your phone facedown during a phone
call to engage speakerphone and just
pick it up again to turn speakerphone
off
our seventh tip doesn't work in every
app but when it does it's very handy in
certain apps like your contacts or the
built-in mail app scrolling with two
fingers offers additional navigation
options instead of just scrolling in
contacts for example it allows you to
scroll through a list of letters for
users with a lot of contacts this could
be a major time saver while most of the
previous tips have been useful or eighth
tip it's just plain cool the camera app
on the HTC Droid DNA has an option for
slo-mo video capture simply enable it in
the scene options menu and the camera
app and shoot away the only problem is
that you take a major hit and video
quality when you use slow-motion still
it's fun to play around with number 9 an
able swipe style typing in the sense
keyboard we've talked about replacement
keyboard apps plenty of times in the
past and swipe is one of the most
popular luckily a similar style of
typing is available right in the sense
keyboard on the Droid DNA simply go to
settings language and keyboard then hit
HTC Sense input find the trace keyboard
option enable it and now your sent
keyboard works almost exactly like swipe
our penultimate tip get better battery
life now we could go much more in depth
here but there are a few things you can
do right away that will immediately
result in better battery life first turn
off automatic brightness and set your
display to a low but usable brightness
second if you're using a Wi-Fi
connection turn off mobile data you can
also go to usage under the battery menu
and close any apps that are using a lot
of battery it may not seem like much but
these methods combined will help squeeze
out some crucial extra battery life on a
busy day the final tip on our list
unload unused apps from RAM the recent
apps button on the Droid DNA is useful
for switching back and forth between
oft-used apps but there's another handy
use for it that you may not know about
as you scroll through the list of apps
you can flick any apps you're no longer
using off the screen not only does this
remove them from the list it actually
moves them from memory for example if
you have a tab opening Chrome fling
Chrome off the screen then watch how the
app needs to reload the page the next
time you open it up
and that my friends wraps up our list
now obviously there are so many
different possible tips and tricks for
the HTC Droid DNA that there's no way we
could fit them all into one video so if
you have a favorite tip and/or trick
that we left out please let us know in
the comments below now here's the thing
