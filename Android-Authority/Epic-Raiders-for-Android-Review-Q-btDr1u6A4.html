authority and I wanted to show you all a
new game that I found called epic
raiders if you look at the style right
off the bat the art style you'll see
that it's heavily anime inspired it
scales very nicely to the nexus 7 screen
which is the device that I'm playing it
on right now and so to get right into it
I'm going to touch screen to begin
you'll notice that there's a loading
screen in between most everything you do
they'll be loading screen now you have
three save slots you have about a
settings and help right here in a back
button that takes you back to the title
screen so I'm going to hop back into my
save slot and there's tips in between
each loading screen and such now once we
get actually into the game i want to
show you all we have a fairly robust
menu right here shop inventory skills
party back button down here in green we
have dungeons we have pvp we have higher
help we have mail we also have gold up
top and stars now gold you can purchase
with rolled money you can also purchase
stars both of them are currency that
you'll use to upgrade gear and once you
upgrade you you can actually upgrade
just a particular piece of gear using a
talent point I want to show you guys the
main purpose of the game the battle I've
done the first level I've unlocked a
second when you'll see that there's this
chain and so you have a little bit of
freedom and where you go you receive
gold and experience every time you
complete a mission and I've already done
this one says protecting the saint is
the basically the battle speaking of
that you'll notice in the top left hand
corner I have two characters the guy
with the blue helmet is the night the
lady with the white hat with the Red
Cross is the saint the night is the
defender and the attacker the saint is
the healer so hopping right into it i'll
show you how the game works it's all
touch controlled you'll see that we have
two characters here and i simply just
drag the night a straight line to the
mouse warrior guy and attack they they
do and so he's gonna thoroughly thrash
that guy and automatically move on to
that now you heal by doing that by
dragging the Saints straight to the
night so she is going to continue to
automatically heal the night because
I've selected him as the target for
healing and he was just going to
continue pummeling the mice
uh that was the first level so you see
we got enough experience to level up yet
again you get a little bit of gold and
then you advance on you go back to the
main screen and it'll say hey you've
unlocked the next level in a nutshell
that is epic raiders it's a really fun
little game you can go to the item shop
you see which items have stars you have
to purchase with stars so for example
will tap that one and it says it's the
destruction iron shield of the legends
that you need a hundred stars to buy it
so that's kind of pricey in my opinion
but if you go I recently just upgraded
their weapons there are some weapons
that don't have stars next to them and
they just require gold i'm using the
famous sword right now this is the
original weapon that the night came with
the night too and you'll notice that it
is a downgrade for him so you wouldn't
want to get it now in a nutshell again
that is epic raiders it's a really fun
little game by game evil or gamevil
Harvey pronounce their name it is free
but you can use in-app purchases to
further yourself more quickly so one
last time that is epic raiders you can
find it on the google play store</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
