chromecast it's a nice HDMI dongle by
Google that plugs right into your
television and provides a whole new
world of media streaming possibilities
however some of you out there kind of
use the chromecast already and maybe you
wish that it had a little bit more
functionality and on the other hand
there's a number of you out there who
are probably wondering what the
alternatives are to the wonderfully
affordable dongle right here well we
have one in particular and it really
caught our eye and we want to show you
what it's all about
hey Josh for Garf manager authority
what's going on everybody and that image
behind me is coming from my laptop
wirelessly streamed by this the Nereus
Ares pro what I wanted to say real quick
was when it comes to the chromecast we
have a lot of great content already for
you and you probably already saw it we
have videos in regards to just the
review itself and also to some of the
new apps that were opened up to the
ecosystem of the chromecast itself but
also I will give you a quick nutshell
here in terms of the chromecast it's
basically an HDMI dongle that plugs
right into your television and pairs to
your phone via the Wi-Fi connection in
your house and what it will do from
there is allow your phone to communicate
with it and when you want to stream
particular content using a number of
different features and software you will
be able to communicate to the chromecast
to find the content itself it does not
stream straight from the phone it
instead finds the content itself and
streams it independently from there you
will be able to still use your phone the
way that you need to and it's just a
great way of creating what could be
considered a smart TV out of any
television in your house and now we move
on to the Nereus areas Pro itself now
essentially this is a wireless HD
solution that is supposed to take the
HDMI out from your laptop or computer
and wirelessly stream it out to your
HDTV
you start off with the transmitter
itself that goes straight into the HDMI
port on your computer now for people
with slimmer laptops this particular
dongle might not seem as let's say
inconspicuous as you might want it to be
but in my experience it hasn't really
changed experience all that much the one
thing that you will learn when you look
through the Quick Start Guide is that
the actual transmitter itself requires
power just like the receiver does and
case of the transmitter it requires a
USB connection that is provided to you
via a mini USB cord that connects to one
of the USB ports in your computer when
you make it over to the receiver itself
it is a small little box that does have
to be plugged into either a USB port
that will be able to power it for all
that it has to do or for probably a much
safer solution you will be able to use
an AC adapter that is also included in
my case I use the AC adapter and is
plugged directly into one of my power
surges that is plugged into the wall
after that you simply just have to get
the HDMI cord that also is included into
the Nereus Ares Pro itself and then the
other side obviously into your TV and
from there you just have to turn on both
devices both pieces of the device and
after that once they get connected you
should be able to use the HDMI out from
your laptop or computer the same way you
would any other secondary display now
the extra bits and pieces that come in
the package of the Ares Perl include a
io transmitter and remote now this IR
transmitter is yet another cord that has
to come out of the receiver and plug in
and you can have it mounted anywhere
that you need the remote to reach it is
something that for the most part I find
that I didn't really have to use because
obviously my streaming sources are just
the laptop straight to the TV not really
changing any of the sources here and
then on top of that you also have a
mount which comes in to a tripod mount
on the bottom of the receiver if you
want to position it anywhere else
a couple velcro strips are available if
you really want to find a nice place for
the receiver for it to be out of the way
but for the most part this is all
obviously due to if your signal is a
little bit weak you can change the
position of the receiver forward to pick
up better but from my experience the
signal was strong enough that no matter
where I put the receiver or where I was
with the transmitter the image still
came in nice and clear and smooth now
especially given the general
plug-and-play nature of the Ares Perl I
do have to say that the quality of the
image itself is actually quite stellar I
did find perhaps it's more of my
laptop's fault with maybe it's somewhat
lack of power but in when I had the
extended displays or even the clone
displays I was able to watch everything
with minimal lag
and when I'm watching certain videos
like let's say full screen YouTube
videos there might be a little bit of
stutter in the actual smoothness of the
image but for the most part it wasn't
any experience breaking type of deal yes
there are going to be more chords than
just say if you have the one HDMI cord
that's connected from the laptop to the
to the monitor but for all intents and
purposes if you really need to be able
to go around your room or even around
the house with your laptop and be able
to see it on a large display like let's
say a very big HDTV or a projector I can
see where this devices usage can be
really put to good use now one point in
the column for the chromecast is for the
fact that you can find the content in
your in your various services hit play
and then it will send right over to the
chromecast you don't really have to do
too much work aside from that however on
the Ares pro you are able to still use
the computer and have a secondary
display showing all of the content like
I said before you might see a little bit
of stutter but really not all that much
but also I getting all of that set up
and moving the browser tab over or
moving the actual window over from one
monitor to the other you know that it's
just a little bit more time consuming
and it might be a first-world problem to
be honest but it's definitely one of
those things you notice one of the great
things about the chromecast is the fact
that it is so easy to use once you have
it plugged in and you get the setup done
you can literally get anything from your
phone and just send it right over in
this case you do have to get setup with
your windows or mac or linux setup in
order to have it provide the experience
that you want and so there you have it
for the Ares pro by Nereus now of course
we have one last portion of this review
in comparison to the chromecast and that
is of course the price that is
definitely the rub here because the area
stroke comes in at 250 dollars that's
where the chromecast comes in at 35
dollars it is a wonderful and affordable
entry point for anybody who's just
looking for simple media streaming and
really wants to connect the phone to the
chromecast to the TV to create a Smart
TV out of whatever TV might be lying
around in your house in the case of the
Ares pro it is really for the tech
junkie out there who wants to stream
literally everything and that does
include games which is a great feature
of this little HDMI streamer
but with that price point you are
getting what you pay for and luckily
with the Ares pro you get a lot and a
lot of good performance out of something
with its price point so as always thank
you guys very much for watching and we
just wanted to show you what one of the
alternatives are out there you saw
Kevin's review of the miracast and how
that was different from the streaming of
the chromecast now obviously that was
different
and now the Ares pro is a bit different
as well in very very obvious cases
especially the price but we just wanted
to show you what other alternatives out
there because HDMI streaming is actually
a thing and the chromecast is not
necessarily the only player in the game
but we will say it is probably one of
the best that there is in the game so
with all that in mind make sure you drop
