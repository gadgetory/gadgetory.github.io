of our news is coming from this time
around hey it's Josh Berg are from
android authority what's going on
everybody and it's time for another dose
of the week's top Android news it's
android authority weekly coming to you
live from Aoife in berlin clearly the
vast majority of the news that we have
in this edition comes from Aoife but
some of the important news actually came
out even before the exhibition doors
opened namely from samsung yes the
Galaxy Note 3 was unveiled to no one's
real surprise but what did catch us all
off guard was the material choice this
is no longer a glossy plastic phone like
so many of Samsung's of their offerings
instead a textured plastic made to
someone mimicked leather it replaces it
under the hood you get the update
performance with the Snapdragon 800 and
3 gigabytes of RAM all of which power
the new S Pen and multitasking
functionalities it is a true beast of a
phone but it does come with a little
friend also true to the rumor samsung
came out with its own SmartWatch and it
is called the galaxy gear it's a stylish
little device that comes with a load of
abilities aside from pairing to your
Galaxy Note 3 via bluetooth and viewing
your notifications the gear can actually
take calls and comes with speakers and
microphones to do so plenty of apps will
be made for the gear but we're told it's
a pretty closed ecosystem developers
might be able to make that change
however these are two devices that are
supposed to come together and so we can
expect them to come in bundles across
major carriers speaking of development
it was revealed what the next iteration
of Android is going to be called what we
were originally calling key lime pie a
all over the place is actually going to
be called KitKat yes it seems branding
isn't going to be an issue for either
company as KitKat even changed up their
websites and mimicked typical smartphone
marketing you should go check that out
4.4 kitkat will apparently be made for
everyone which suggests that it will be
compatible with even older hardware new
statue was put up at the Google campus
commemorating the announcements we'll
have more for you about the upcoming
version as more Kit Kats come our way
but what's that a wild new Nexus
smartphone appears yes this shot taking
out the KitKat statue shows someone
taking a picture of it using a unique
looking smart phone nexus logo readable
winning landscape looks like a soft
touch plastic could that be the nexus 5
but we all just he can't just go about
calling the next Nexus smartphone the
Nexus 5 or anything but it does look
like a slightly small
seven which is definitely something I
could get behind patent listings show
the Reuben Nexus 5 might have gotten
passed through the FCC already so we
might be seeing the next Nexus
smartphone quite soon now plenty of
people out there still think that LG
might be the developer of the next Nexus
smartphone but this week LG got into the
news for a different reason the Korean
manufacturer officially got back into
the tablet game with the announcement of
the g pad an 8 point 3 inch tablet made
just for you the g pad tries to be the
best tablet without trying to go
overboard with the typical plastic front
the tablet employs a welcome-back you
made of aluminum it includes all of the
functions the great g2 smartphone has
and adds in seamless entered device
functionality will have a full review of
the g pad soon so stay tuned and finally
we end on sony whose newest flagship
phone has until now been called the oh
Namie phone however as is the trend a
lot of the rumors happen to be true and
now we know the inami phone as the Sony
Xperia z1 a 5 inch device morning the
Snapdragon 800 the Xperia z1 retains the
general design of the experience see
what comes with an incredible camera
powered by what is called the G lens the
G lens is supposed to reach a similar
quality to Sony's contact cameras and
sports a whopping 20.7 megapixels
however the camera department wasn't
left for the z1s glory as the fabled
attachment lenses were also unveiled the
QX line includes the 110 sporting 20.2
megapixel and 18.2 megapixel exmor r
CMOS sensors respectively the biggest
news regarding these lenses is that they
aren't just for xperia phones yes they
even attached to iPhones basically any
Wi-Fi direct device will connect to the
lenses which include their own hardware
buttons built-in camera app that is
installed on the phone and even its own
memory via microSD cards these little
lens units are definitely different but
they sport pretty great quality close to
the stela compact camera a sony RX
