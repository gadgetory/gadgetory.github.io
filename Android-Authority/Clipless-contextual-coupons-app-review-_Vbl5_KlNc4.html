Hindy the android authority app guy
Android is moving more toward a
contextual content experience now
Michael Barr nathin former senior
software engineer at google has released
a contextual coupon app called clipless
and today we're going to take a closer
look at it we'll start out by saying
that clipless is a very simple
application it only has two screens to
browse around on there is a list of all
the deals that are nearest to you sort
of how you want them and a map screen
that shows you where these deals are
it's a simple but effective layout in
the list section you see deals that are
in your general area they can be sorted
by distance rating how much you can save
and a few other options most deals are
sponsored by eight coupon yep it's and
Yelp which are known to be reliable
sources the map shows you where each
deal is in the defined radius you can go
as high as 30 miles or as low as 2 miles
so whether you're exploring the city are
just taking a short drive you can find
stuff to buy it discounted prices the
last big feature of clipless is the
notification system as you drive by a
place that has a deal you'll get a
notification on your device letting you
know that there is a deal nearby this
too is customizable and you can get
notifications whether you're a subway
car or a city block away this is an
awesome way to find deals while you're
out doing what you normally do you may
be wondering how you can use this this
app has exactly one use and that is to
find coupons and deals around your
general area if you're a fan of saving
money on stuff this app can be of great
use to you also during testing we found
deals on just about everything from food
to doctors to hair salons and even
tattoo parlors using the app is easy you
can use the interface to browse for
deals in your area alternatively you can
just turn the app on and start driving
and it'll let you know when you're close
to a deal that's really about all it
does like we said it's nice and simple
so here's what we liked first and
foremost its simplicity is one of its
best features there is nothing
complicated about this app the list is
easy to read the map is easy to follow
and the notifications work as intended
you simply open it up set your settings
and go we also really like the
notifications driving around town and
getting an alert when you're passing by
a business that's tossing a sale is a
lot better than sitting on the couch
hunting for a sale to take advantage of
it takes out a lot of the guesswork and
you may find
surprising stuff just on your daily
commute lastly we like the reliability
these aren't coupons from shady coupons
that may not work calm these are trusted
sources like Yelp and eight coupon and
you can choose how often the list
updates with fresh deals so it's very
unlikely that you'll find deals that
have expired or don't work and so here's
what we didn't like our only big issue
with the app where the loading times
when going from a two-mile search radius
to a 30-mile search radius the app takes
a very long time to update the map and
list if you refresh before the update is
complete you lose your two-mile results
and you have to wait for the app to cash
everything in 30 miles we understand it
has a lot of deals to load but that
doesn't prevent the weight from being a
little unpleasant the rest can be
described as little nitpicks there's a
little bit of lag when scrolling large
lists it doesn't ruin the app but it is
noticeable the design is efficient and
functional but it looks a little
outdated these don't prevent the app
from doing its job or even prevent
people from enjoying it they're just
little nitpicks that we found so what do
we think of clipless it's a great app
there are a lot of coupon apps out there
but this one combines simplicity context
and reliability in a way that few others
have it has its problems but at the end
of the day the problems aren't nearly
bad enough to be concerned about what
impressed us the most is the app works
the same way no matter how you use it if
you like searching long lists for good
deals you can do that if you're lazy
like me and you want deals to come to
you they will if you're looking to save
a few bucks there are plenty of worse
things you can do then try this app out
if you want to the app is in the video
