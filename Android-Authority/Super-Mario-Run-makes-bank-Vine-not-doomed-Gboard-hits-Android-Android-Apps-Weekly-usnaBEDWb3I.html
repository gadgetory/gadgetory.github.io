weekly show is brought to you by envy
SMS and messenger hello again ladies and
gentlemen I'm Joe Hindy the android
authority app guy and welcome back to
android apps weekly it's also Christmas
so happy holidays everybody now let's
get right into the app news a round of
Twitter hacks made their rounds this
week the white hat hacker group our mind
has claimed responsibility their targets
included the official u.s. accounts for
Netflix and Marvel Comics along with the
verified accounts of Tony Stark and
Captain America the group has also
successfully hacked Twitter CEO Jack
Dorsey and sundar pichai earlier this
year everything is back to normal now
but it was a fun week there is a new
YouTube show out called devs the premise
of the show is to shine light on how
video games are made on top of that
there are some pretty good insights on
things like how the industry has changed
over the last few years it also talks
about things like why Finland is a good
spot for mobile game development it's a
fun little show and definitely worth a
watch if you like this kind of stuff
amazon announced this week that it's
going to start taking india more
seriously during an interview this week
an executive stated that amazon was
ready to make the necessary investments
to do just that this comes just a week
after amazon launched its prime service
in India the company will receive some
competition from flipkart which is to be
expected the investments made by Amazon
in India so far are the largest in
company history as it turns out vine
isn't doomed after all the company plans
on stripping down the application and
then re-releasing it as vine camera
sometime in early 2017 it'll still take
six second videos like the app did
except for this time you can upload them
directly to Twitter or keep them on your
camera roll videos should also be
compatible with other social networks
will tell you more about it when we get
our hands on it early next year Super
Mario run has made an estimated 14
million dollars in just a few days the
game has already rocketed to the top of
the charts on iOS despite mixed reviews
from pundits the game had five million
dollars along with five million
downloads in its first day that's a
whole lot more than Pokemon go friends
we imagine both numbers will rise
significantly once there is an Android
release and according to Nintendo it
should be out on Android and early 2017
Retro City Rampage d
is an action-adventure game it's also
reminiscent of the very early Grand
Theft Auto titles you'll engage with an
overhead view of a retro world as you
complete missions do challenges play
minigames and explore the open-world it
boasts well over a hundred activities in
total 50 vehicles to steal 25 weapons
200 character customizations and a lot
more the game plays well enough although
there are some early release bugs that
you may have to deal with in any case
it's four dollars and ninety-nine cents
with no in-app purchases Google revamp
their google keyboard last week and
turned it into G board at its core it
still works pretty much as it did before
however there is now google search
integrated directly into the keyboard
this allows you to search for
practically anything and then
immediately share it this includes the
popular gifs search a feature that was
highly touted in the iOS version of the
app it's completely free to use in case
you're interested about the only
downside is that you may run into a few
bugs here and there Twilight Struggle is
a board game that has been ported to
android the game puts you in the center
of the Cold War and the political drama
between the USSR and the United States
you'll draw event cards play them out
and then strategize accordingly you can
play with people online or against AI
opponents if you wish the mobile
controls work rather well and you'll
even have an online profile showing all
of your stats it's a relatively
inexpensive game at four dollars and
ninety-nine cents and you can buy
additional content as in-app purchases
team win recovery project has been a
go-to after market recovery on Android
for years now they finally have an
official app and it's not overly
complicated you can open it find your
device download the recovery and then
you can flash it it can also help keep
you up to date on which version that you
have so that you can install updates
later if you need to as you probably
guessed you will need root access on
your phone to use this app to its
fullest extent if you're rooted and
using team win recovery projects you
definitely want this app thankfully it's
totally free Rovio is added again with
another casual game called angry birds
blast it's a match 3 game where your
goal is to break certain blocks each
around to free a certain type of bird it
works pretty much like every other match
3 game where you wait for two or three
of the same color to line up and then
you tap them you'll also have boosts and
powers to make things go a little easier
the game has 250 levels colorful
graphics and a family friendly demeanor
it's a casual game through and through
but it's not all that bad if you need a
time waster envy SMS and messenger is an
SMS and MMS app that also doubles as a
standalone messaging app you'll be
greeted with a variety of features
including a built-in meme generator
emoji stickers group chats voice to text
and a lot more since it supports SMS you
won't need to invite your friends to use
the service it also includes a new
feature called the awesome bar which
gives you all kinds of fun stuff at the
touch of a button it rocks a pretty
decent design that features material
design and the application itself works
very well it's a simple clean app that
is easy to use and has tons of
functionality you can pick it up for
free with no in-app purchases right now
