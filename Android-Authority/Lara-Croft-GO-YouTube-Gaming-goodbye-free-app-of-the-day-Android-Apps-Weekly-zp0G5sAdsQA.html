Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly we
had a lot of great news this week so
let's get right into it Microsoft is now
letting people download Cortana as part
of a public beta which is the first time
it's officially been made available to
the public there's only one problem that
is you cannot participate in the public
beta unless you live in the United
States we don't think that'll change
which does kind of suck a new
application called visor was leaked
recently and it prompted the developer
to just release the application early
it's a chrome application that lets you
easily control your android device from
your computer it's a nifty tool even if
it's in beta and keep an eye out for
pricing because there will be some
pricing options eventually the Facebook
M has been officially announced and much
like the leaks said it'll be a personal
assistant that lives inside a facebook
Messenger that helps you buy things
along with the suite of other functions
for productivity it's currently in
testing and we have no clue when it'll
be made available to the public earlier
this week rovio announced that they'll
be laying off one third of their
workforce the speculation is that the
angry birds franchise is finally
starting to falter as the company just
released Angry Birds to not long ago to
apparent success the company maintains
that it made these layoffs to be leaner
and more agile earlier this week amazon
killed off the free app of the day and
replaced it with a new application
called amazon underground the new
application is meant to offer a lot more
applications that the company is calling
actually free you can download install
amazon underground just like any other
amazon application before even more
Android apps headlines updates and new
releases don't forget to check out this
week's newsletter which is linked in the
video description below there we have a
whole lot more apps and games news that
we didn't have time for this week if
you're so inclined you can even sign up
using your email address and we'll send
it to you every single Friday well
you're at it why not check out the
android authority twitch channel yes
we'll be doing youtube gaming very soon
as well but we still plan on hanging out
on twitch every now and again right now
our streaming schedule is sunday and
monday at four pm eastern standard time
come hang out chit chat and play some
video games with us ok folks to take a
look at the apps and games that made a
big splash this week as usual if you
want to check any of these applications
out you can find the links in the video
description below late last week AMC
released its own official application to
the Google Play Store it comes with a
lineup of AMC programming including The
Walking Dead better call Saul hell on
wheels and a whole lot more you
you need a cable subscription to have
access to most of the content but some
of the stuff you'll be able to access
for free it's missing some features here
and there and the application is
suffering from some release day bugs but
it's definitely worth keeping an eye on
earlier this week samsung released the
samsung galaxy note5 and s6 edge+
experience applications the point of
these absences show people what kind of
experience they can get with these
devices and Samsung has released similar
applications in the past for their
flagships they are fairly easy to use
and it's a nice experience if you plan
on buying either one of these devices or
if you just want to see what they're all
about YouTube gaming is finally official
in google has released the official
application to prove it Google's
competitor to twitches in full swing and
the application will give you access to
everyone who is streaming games you'll
also be able to engage with past
broadcasts plenty of channel and page
browsing options and the application
will offer live streams from larger
events like III packs and games con it's
definitely worth checking out and hate
you'll see us there very very soon
framed is an award-winning puzzle game
with a unique premise you are given a
set of video clips which you must
arrange to create a certain story scene
if you do it incorrectly you lose the
game and if you do it right you can't
proceed it's backed by a pretty decent
jazz soundtrack and there is a lot of
game to play here it's definitely
something a little bit different and
actually very fun to play it's only 99
cents and it's worth every penny last
and certainly not least this week as
Laura cropped go this highly anticipated
game has finally made its way to Google
Play to extremely positive reviews so
far the title of features 75 puzzles
over five chapters as you guide Laura
through obstacles and fights with
various creatures it holds true to the
series as you'll be exploring ancient
ruins with mythical puzzles it looks
good it plays great and 499 isn't an
unfair price at all once again I'm Joe
