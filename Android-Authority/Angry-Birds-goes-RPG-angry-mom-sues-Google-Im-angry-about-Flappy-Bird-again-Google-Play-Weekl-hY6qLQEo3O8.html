Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Google Play weekly so
did anyone else notice that the new
YouTube update lets you reply to
comments now that made me a happy panda
also this week we're going to talk about
some Google Play legal problems a new
angry birds game that's in the mix and
the potential return of flappy bird if
you've been in the market for some cloud
storage then Google Drive just became a
much larger target on your radar it was
announced earlier this week that Google
drive's cloud storage will be taking
quite the price dive the new prices are
100 gigabytes for a dollar ninety-nine
one terabyte for 999 and more than 10
terabytes for just short of a hundred
dollars of course as per the norm you
can still get your customary 15
gigabytes of storage for free
permanently just for signing up these
are spectacular prices for cloud storage
and they officially plunge google drive
into the race for being the cheapest
cloud storage available today if you
take into account their many drive
oriented office tools and the remarkable
web and mobile apps it's really hard not
to take Google up on this deal so far
the reception has been universally
positive his friends ro bo is at it
again with another angry birds game this
time instead of racing or flinging birds
it's going to be an RPG the new game is
called Angry Birds epic and according to
kotaku the game will be out in a limited
capacity in Canada and Australia
sometime at the end of the week or early
next week with a full release coming
down the road so far all we know about
this game is that it is coming it is in
fact an RPG and it will be released to
Android iOS and Windows Phone oh and
there will also be in app purchases we
don't know much else other than that
because the only video rovio has
released is a visually boring teaser of
a bird in a suit of armor and along with
a couple of screenshots frequent viewers
of the Google Play weekly show note just
how much i love a good RPG so I'm
excited to see Rovio's likely
light-hearted spin on the genre thanks
to rovio's last title and their penchant
for using ridiculous in-app purchases my
expectations are actually quite low so
it may turn out to be pretty decent so
by now pretty much everybody knows what
quizup is it's a wildly popular quiz
game that came out of practically
nowhere
it was released not even a week ago and
it already has garnered over 500,000
downloads and rocks a solid 4.5 rating
in the google play store since its
release it's already been updated once
to allow for art supports improve
stability and slightly different UI
layouts it's been all over social media
and we wouldn't be surprised to see this
get several million more downloads we
won't talk about it too much here
because I did a review of quiz up a few
days ago and you can find that on the
android authority YouTube channel we
also did a sort of let's play where Josh
Vergara and I went head-to-head in a few
rounds and we'll have that video linked
up here at the end of this video it was
a lot of fun so keep an eye out for more
of those kinds of videos as well so yeah
flappy bird might actually be coming
back over the last week flappy bird
developer dog nuin sat down with Rolling
Stone magazine to talk about his life
his future flappy bird and other games
he's currently working on of course the
news that everyone picked up on right
away was the hint that dog may be
re-releasing flappy bird to the google
play store and the Apple App Store now
that we have the bad news part of this
story out of the way dog went on to talk
about how he's working on three other
games including a cowboy-themed shooter
a vertical flying game and an action
chess game thanks to his budding stardom
we've no doubt that all three of these
games will get prime coverage when they
eventually come out and one is scheduled
for release later this month so keep an
eye out for that and our last bit of
news this week in Northern California
mom is suing google because her kid went
nuts with some in-app purchases okay so
here's what happened a kid in California
ended up spending a total of sixty five
dollars and ninety-five cents on in-app
purchases and Marvel run jump smash the
child had a 30-minute window after the
app was downloaded where a password
didn't need to be entered to make
purchases and of course the kid took
full advantage of the freedom to spend
based on this the mother decided to sue
google to remove that 30 minute window
there was a heated debate for a couple
of days about whether or not the lawsuit
held any water apparently google thought
it did because the new update to the
google play store that's rolling out
right now not only has a few UI changes
but also makes it easier to remove that
30 minute window so even if the quote
responsible unquote woman was in the
wrong by letting her kid play with the
phone while unsupervised it is a problem
that should now go away
so who's ready to see some trending
applications as usual if you want to
check any of these applications out you
find the links in the written companion
which is in the video description below
first up this week is the minimum
keyboard it has officially left beta
with the release of version 2 point 0
for those who may not remember or don't
know minimum is a unique spin on a
keyboard where you can type a little
more sloppy and the app knows what you
mean to say the 2 point 0 update comes
with bug fixes visual improvements
reduce lag and more consequently talent
for twitter has also been updated to
version 2 point 0 and with that has come
a lot of new features and improvements
among them are a boatload of bug fixes
and performance improvements better
stability more tweets for tweet marker a
new widgets visual improvements and
fixes and a whole lot more it hasn't hit
its Twitter token limit yet and it's a
great third party Twitter app if you're
looking for one the answer is a new
social network that's kind of a mix
between IRC and AOL Instant Messenger
it's a completely anonymous social
network where you chit chat with people
who have similar interests as you their
app for Android is now available and
aside from a few early day jitters it
appears to be somewhat solid people are
reporting that battery drains quickly
and there are a few features that are
missing from the websites but it is
usable if you want to try out an old
premise wrapped in a new skin dead
llings is a new side-scrolling
platformer available for android and
it's actually pretty unique it boasts a
more loose and fun style of gameplay and
provides a goofy atmosphere that isn't
meant to be taken too seriously there
are over 100 levels for different
zombies to play and one touch controls
it's fun and it's free with in-app
purchases so it can't hurt to check it
out you know just don't hand it off to a
kid for half an hour threes is a new
game for android that copies the concept
of the popular iOS game called vibes in
this game you're given a grid with a few
tiles filled in with ones and twos your
job is to push those together to make
threes and then the threes into one
another to create six is then you push
the six together to create 12 and so on
and so forth this continues until you
can no longer make any more moves and
the game then ends it's an addictive
little puzzle game that a lot of people
seem to be enjoying it for a limited
time you can get it for 30
three-point-three percent off which puts
it at a dollar ninety-nine once again
