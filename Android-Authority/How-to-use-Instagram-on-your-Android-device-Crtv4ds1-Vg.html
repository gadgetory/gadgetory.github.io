Channel I'm mark Instagram is one of
today's most popular photo sharing apps
for Android with a simple interface and
interactivity instagram offers a fun way
to share photo snippets of your life to
online friends in this video I'll show
you around Instagram and show you some
of the basics of using it as well as
some tips and tricks ready let's begin
the first time you run the app after
installing it you'll be asked to
register or sign in just sign into your
account or register for a new account if
you don't have one yet
you can quickly register if you have a
Facebook account
Instagram will use some of your Facebook
profile info but you'll still need to
specify an Instagram username and
password
upon registration the app will also ask
whether you want to follow your Facebook
friends who are also instagramers the
app also suggests other popular users
that you can follow right after
registering or logging in you'll see a
screen like this this is the apps main
screen also known as the Home tab it
displays all photos that you've posted
or from users that you follow these
buttons are your doors to instagrams
various tabs and features this one's the
home button tap this to return to the
main screen or home tab this next one's
the explore button it's for viewing or
browsing photos from random users the
middle button is the camera button this
opens the camera app and is the starting
point of all photo sharing on Instagram
the fourth button opens the news tab
where you can find updates from users
you've followed and this last button
opens your profile page where you can
access your profile info account
statistics settings photos and more one
of the biggest reasons why people use
instagrams to share interesting photos
to other Instagram users how exactly can
you achieve that you can share photos
from only two sources your existing
photos in the gallery or by capturing a
new photo to start sharing photos this
is the button to tap this is the
Instagram advanced camera which is the
default way to acquire photos for
sharing it's a very simple camera
it hardly need any guidance to use it
you can also set Instagram to use the
stock Android camera app if you prefer
if you want to use an existing photo
instead you can tap this gallery icon
and pick a photo from one of your albums
let's try taking a photo if your phone
supports it you can use tap to focus so
you can easily focus on your subject you
can also turn on the flash if you like
regardless of the photo source you'll
have a chance to apply filters and
enhancements to your photo before you
can publish it to your photo feed and
now here's the screen where all the
photo enhancement happens at the top is
a row of buttons let's see what each one
does this one's the frame toggle if the
button looks like this certain filters
will enclose your photo inside the frame
this theater op button is for applying
the tilt shift or depth of field effect
on your photo you can choose either a
radial effect to mimic shadow depth of
field a linear tilt shift or no tilt
shift let's try putting a tilt shift
effect here let's try the radial blur
try adjusting the radius like this hmm
looks nice huh what about the linear
tilt shift I can move the bars like this
or rotate it with two fingers like this
hmm
looks nice to it but the radial blur
looks better so I'll use it this next
button is for Lux it brings out color
details in your photos effectively
making them appear more vibrant let's
see if it makes my photo better hmm not
quite good for this photo I can skip
looks for now this filter doesn't work
well in all cases especially with
extremely dim or extremely bright photos
this button as you might have guessed is
for rotating the photo at the bottom of
the photo is a row of preset photo
filters choose one that makes your photo
look awesome if you don't want to apply
a filter choose normal from this row the
Sierra filter looks nice here so I'll go
with it take know that you cannot use
multiple filters also the filters
included in Instagram are limited if you
need more you can use third-party photo
editors that can produce Instagram
compatible photos
I'm done enhancing my photo time to post
this to my photo feed now tap the next
button this is the final step on this
page you can specify a caption for your
photo you can also use hashtags in your
caption to add your photo to a keyword
group hashtags begin with the hash or
pound sign my sample photo here is cool
and epic and I'm going to hash tag it
with a keywords cool and epic I can even
weave these keywords into the caption
itself hashtags make your photos more
searchable so use them but don't abuse
them you can also place your photo on
your photo map by checking this option
here you can also provide an optional
name for the location you can even
simultaneously publish the photo to
other social networks like Twitter
Facebook Tumblr Flickr and Foursquare
just tap each name and sign in if needed
finally published a post by tapping the
green check mark at the corner let's see
if we successfully posted my photo to my
feed voila the other biggest reason why
people use Instagram is that they want
to view interesting photos shared by
other Instagram users how do you go
about viewing photos and Instagram all
of the latest photos posted by you or
shared by your friends are visible on
the Home tab just tap this button to go
to the Home tab here you can like photos
or leave comments for their owners you
can manually refresh the home tab by
tapping the refresh button if you find
an offensive or inappropriate photo on
your photo stream this three dotted
button will be of great help
it lets you report the inappropriate
photo to Instagram suppose you found a
really intriguing photo and you want to
find out whether the Instagrammer who
posted it has other interesting photos
that you can check out what to do just
tap the instagramers profile photo or
user name to open the users profile page
from there you can see all of that users
photos you can like or comment on the
photos to Instagram let's see discover
interesting photos from users around the
world you can do this on the explore tab
every time you tap this refresh button
up here you'll get a new set of random
photos open a photo by tapping his
thumbnail on the photos page you can
like it or comment on it you can also
view the users profile from here and
follow the user another way to discover
new photos is by doing a hashtag search
from the explore tab tap the search
button at the upper right then switch to
the tags tab this works just like the
keyword search type a keyword here like
this and you'll get a list of hashtags
containing or related to that keyword
let's check this first hashtag which has
over a million photos these are photos
tagged with the hash puppies tagged also
do not include spaces in your search
terms hashtags don't use spaces so if
you search for a keyword like this you
might not get results but try it without
spaces like this and voila
whenever you view an Instagram photo you
can show that you like the photo or
leave a comment for its owner or both
liking a photo is easy to do just double
tap a photo or tap the heart button the
heart should light up in red if you
accidentally liked a photo and do it by
tapping the heart button so that it's no
longer red when you like photos on
Instagram the photos are placed in some
kind of collection of photos that you
like all in one place so that you can
easily find them just go to your profile
page open the settings page and tap this
you'll see a grid of thumbnails of all
the photos that you've liked tap a
thumbnail to open the photos page you
can remove photos from this collection
by unliking them one by one
sometimes liking a photo just won't cut
it
at times you just need to express how
you feel about the photo for this
purpose you can leave a comment just tap
the text balloon button at the bottom of
the comments then type your message and
hit Send be careful when typing your
comment you can't edit your comment once
you publish it but you can delete your
own comments by tapping the edit button
up here and tapping the X button beside
the comment that you want to remove if
you find a comment that's out of line or
abusive report it to Instagram by
tapping the red warning button beside
the comment
you can also hashtag a photo through
your comments
this way the photo you're commenting on
will be added to the keyword that you
specified for example I found this
really cute photo and I want to tag it
with the hash cute keyword this is how
I'll do it this particular photo will
then be grouped together with other
photos bearing the same hashtag if
you're new to Instagram you probably
don't have a lot of followers yet you
probably aren't even following anyone
yet to follow an instagramer means to
subscribe to that instagramers photo
feed so that you can view the users
photos how do you know what's going on
with the people who follow you or whom
you are following where do you look for
users to follow to get the latest buzz
about your followers those whom you're
following open the news tab on the tab

users that you're following including
who liked whom who got a photo to the
popular page who started following whom
and so on the you tab is free news
related to you and your photos including
friend requests new comments who started
following you and so on what about
looking for other users to follow though
there are several ways one way is

random photos tap a photo that interests

user name to open the profile page and
tap the follow button another way is to
look through your friends followers and

another possible Avenue to discover
other interesting folks to follow still
another way is to search for names or
user names this can be done by going to
