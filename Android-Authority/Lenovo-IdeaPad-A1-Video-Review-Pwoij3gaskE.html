authority today we're taking a look at
the 7-inch tablet from lenovo the
ideapad a10 labels the a1 as a tablet
for the consumer seeking a mobile
entertainment device for staying
connected to family and friends
accessing social media networks and
enjoy music and movies in a small
lightweight and affordable package does
it hold its claims in short yes on the
next year we have solid device on the
top and bottom bezel curves for easy
holding its solid feel well built on the
side it has a volume rocker on the
bottom slot for SD USB and I'm speaker
on top we have the power the headphones
and a mic but it is a fingerprint magnet
so if that's gonna drive you nuts you
may need to cover our case spec-wise
it's nothing stunning but it gets by it
has a 1 gigahertz processor a front and
back camera 7s display at 1024 x 600
weighs less than a pound and again as
expandable storage software wise fill an
a1 has android 2.3 you which is a
smartphone OS giving you a mobile
experience well it's not built for
tablet it is still fully functional for
most purposes where it shows the most of
the mobile phone is with the browser as
you can see it's the mobile phone
website many websites these days have a
mobile theme and the full version but
for sites that don't it can be kind of
frustrating
some bloatware is on the phone or on the
tablet notably an AB droid ebuddy go
keyboard for lenovo all these can be
uninstalled what can't be uninstalled
though is the launcher which would be
nice feel get rid of if you wanted to
stock stock gingerbread is solid though
it does what you need to do and it gets
the job done most apps work with it
unlike Ice Cream Sandwich where you do
have some limitations however wise the
screen looks good um it is multi-touch
could be a little more sensitive around
the edges I had some problems when
texting messages on facebook on the
edges here but nothing major camera
quality could be better no flash so it
has bad low-light conditions and captive
touch buttons shut off when you're not
using it it's hot it's hard to find them
in low light settings I wish you could
leave them on but that is an option that
I could find well it is not hard to find
a tablet in the a1's price range it is
hard to find one as well built and
feature-rich as they one is the perfect
tablet for those people looking to enter
the tablet world for the first time day
1 comes with all the standard features
the more expensive larger tablets have
at a cheaper price
