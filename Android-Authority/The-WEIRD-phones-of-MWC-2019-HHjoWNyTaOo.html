some of the biggest smartphone launches
in the world and this year things got a
little weird Samsung and Huawei
headphones that fold in half
LG's flagship sees the blood in your
veins and Nokia brought out a device
with five cameras but things got really
interesting when you look beyond the big
launches here are some of the coolest
and weirdest phones from MWC 2019 the
energizer Power Max P 18 kpop is the
thickest and heaviest Android phone
we've ever seen this bad boy will keep
running for days at an end thanks to its
eighteen thousand milliamp hour battery
for reference that's four to six times
what you would get with a normal Android
phone the obvious downside is you'll
have to carry a brick around which
probably won't be fun the cloud minds
x.i is a bit like a tricorder from Star
Trek you can point it at a drug or other
unknown substance and it will tell you
what it is that's because this phone has
a built-in spectrometer cloud minds also
showed off a phone with a built-in
ultrasound scanner these devices are
designed for scientists and industrial
use but they are actual real Android
phones you could use to browse Instagram
after a long day of science made by a
Chinese company nomu the t18 is ideal
for Preppers if you want to be ready for
anything this phone will take a beating
it's rugged water-resistant and even
hardened against explosions if you find
yourself without cell service you can
use the built-in walkie-talkie to reach
other people this is the phone you'll
want to have when the zombie apocalypse
comes before continue I'd like to give a
quick shout out to digit daily our
sponsor for Mobile World Congress 2019
your tech news direct your Inbox make
sure to check the link in the
description below for more information
the Hisense a6 is pretty tame compared
to some of the other phones on this list
but how often do you see a phone with
two displays an OLED and an eating the
e-ink screen on the back is awesome for
reading ebooks but it can do way more
than that you could even mirror the full
Android interface on it
ian's screens don't consume your battery
when not in use so battery life should
be great
remember QWERTY slider phones a company
called FX Tech wants to bring them back
the first product is the pro one and
we're pretty impressed with it besides
the full hardware keyboard the pro one
has a great-looking OLED display solid
specs and basically everything you may
want in a daily driver
the sliding keyboard makes it a great
choice for productive users whether you
want to type in a novel or just a
facebook status update this next one is
not really a smart phone but that's what
Nubia calls it the Nubia Alpha features
Smart Watch specs with some smartphone
features sprinkled in you can make calls
on it because it supports Isom the Alpha
has a large OLED screen that bends a
built-in camera gesture controls GPS and
fitness tracking it's not the best
looking device out there but we're
impressed with how much tech there is
inside and that pretty much concludes
our list of weird smartphones from MWC
2019 let us know which one is your
favorite down in the comments section
below and as always keep it tuned here
to Android Authority for more and stay
tuned for the rest of our MWC 2019
