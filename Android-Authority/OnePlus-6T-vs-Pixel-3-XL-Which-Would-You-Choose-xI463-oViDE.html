there's a pretty good chance that you
might also be considering a one plus
sixty after all one plus has always been
very competitive and comparable to
Google's pixel phones and even some of
Google's prior Nexus phones although
oneplus phones have gotten more
expensive over the years they still
undercut the competition by a pretty big
margin because frankly other flagship
smartphones have also gone up in price
the oneplus 60 starts at five hundred
and forty nine dollars for the six
gigabyte of ram version with a hundred
and twenty eight gigs of storage and
tops out at six hundred and twenty nine
dollars with eight gigs of ram and 256
gigs of storage the pixel 3xl starts at
$8.99 for 64 gigabytes and will set you
back $1000 for double the storage both
models come with four gigabytes of RAM
now even though the one plus 60 is
priced very competitively in order for
oneplus to meet that price point they
still have to leave out some key
features that are starting to become
pretty common in a lot of other
smartphones the oneplus 16 doesn't have
wireless charging and it also doesn't
have official IP certification against
water and dust both of which the pixel
3xl have so if you care pretty heavily
about those features the pixel 3 XL is
going to be worth the extra cost
wireless charging is a convenient
feature to have but I don't consider it
a necessity so I don't really mind that
the oneplus sixty doesn't have it and
they're ridiculously fast - charging
sort of makes up for the fact that it
doesn't have wireless charging IP
certification on the other hand is a
very important feature and it's a
feature that's even starting to become
important to the most average of
consumers so it kind of surprises me a
little bit that oneplus hasn't added it
in yet overall though the hardware
between the pixel three XL and one plus
60 are very comparable they both run on
Snapdragon 845 s they both don't have a
headphone jack
they both have large AMOLED screens and
they're both made of metal and glass now
when it comes to design I don't really
prefer one over the other I like them
both pretty equally they're pretty
similar in size they both feel very
comfortable to hold and use and build
quality isn't real
a problem but most phones nowadays tend
to have pretty good build quality
anyways one thing that makes it one plus
60 pretty unique is that it's the first
phone sold in the US with an optical
fingerprint sensor this means that the
fingerprint sensor is embedded
underneath the display and it's pretty
cool and feels very futuristic but it's
nowhere near as fast as the traditional
fingerprint sensor that you get on the
pixel 3xl and it's also pretty
inconsistent sometimes it unlocks at a
reasonable speed and other times it
takes a good 2 to 3 seconds before
actually unlocking which kind of gets
annoying
I think this technology will definitely
get better over time but for now I still
prefer the more traditional fingerprint
sensor of the pixel 3xl something that I
like better about the one +60 though is
the way that it handles the knotch on
its display a lot of phone displays this
year have come with notches but this is
probably the most attractive looking one
it uses this teardrop shaped notch which
cuts out a very small portion of the
screen because it only houses a
front-facing camera and most people will
probably like this over the pixel 3
excels gigantic not like every other
notch you do get used to the pixel 3
excels notch but if you want the best
looking not able the 60 is obviously the
better choice software I think is one of
the biggest reasons why a lot of people
tend to compare oneplus phones to pixel
phones with a pixel 3xl you get the
purest Android software possible it's a
completely stock clean and simple
Android 9pi experience and because it's
a pixel you're always going to be the
first to get the next version of Android
or any other major software update that
Google pushes out the oneplus 60 runs
oxygen OS and what I've always enjoyed
about oxygen OS is that it feels a lot
like stock Android but oxygen OS gives
you a ton of customization options you
can change the accent colors pick
between a light or dark theme and
there's a bunch of different gesture
controls that you can use as shortcuts
for launching apps or other functions
the oneplus sixty also comes with
Android Pi out of the box and oneplus is
one of the better companies out there
when it comes to updating their devices
they're pretty quick with releasing
updates and usually you can try a beta
version of the update
before it goes public if you want the
update even sooner alright so let's talk
about the cameras the oneplus 60 uses a
16 and 20 megapixel combo and the pixel
3xl still uses a single 12 megapixel
lens because Google does so much on the
software side of things that they don't
feel the need to use two lenses the
oneplus sixty produces some really great
images with fantastic colors and
sharpness and keeps up really well with
the pixel 3xl for the most part but the
pixel 3xl outperforms c1 plus 60 in
dynamic range and low-light by no means
is dynamic range on the oneplus 16 bad
it's just that the pixel 3 XL is that
much better and when looking at their
photos side by side you can see how much
more shadow and highlight detail the
pixel 3xl is able to capture low-light
shots from the pixel 3xl are also much
sharper and more detailed and this is
without even resorting to using night
sight night sight pretty much transforms
the pixel 3xl into an entirely different
camera and there isn't much the oneplus
sixty can do to capture a comparable
image so if I had to pick between these
two phones I would go with the pixel 3
XL yes it's a little bit more expensive
but I like the wireless charging
I like the ip68 certification and I
prefer the image quality of the pixel 3
XL the oneplus 60 still provides amazing
value with price to performance and it
also has a super clean software
experience with oxygen OS but as an
overall package
I like the pixel 3xl better but which
one would you guys choose let me know
down in the comment section below if you
are team one plus 60 or if your team
pixel three XL leave that down to the
