everybody and we're taking a look at the
galaxy s 9 plus and the pixel to excel
now quick note I do have a bit of a skin
at the top of mine the glass that is up
here the only bit of glass on the back
I accidentally cracked a little bit of
it so that's why there's a bit of a
different look with my pixel to excel
but we will get into the design aspect
in a second I just want to remind
everybody that I'm just giving my main
take away thoughts here in this video if
you want to see the more in-depth
comparison between these two we have
that and also a camera comparison
available at Android authority comm
there's also going to be a video for the
camera comparison here so you can stay
tuned for that as well now the main
takeaways that I have between these two
devices is that Samsung really tries to
put as much as possible into their
phones and that's something that we've
known for a while but the differences or
the omissions if you will have been a
little bit more obvious this time around
the pixel to excel for example doesn't
have the glass on glass design and
because of that there is no IP
certification but more to the point
there's no wireless charging and while
there aren't any extra buttons on the
pixel 2xl compared to the Bigsby button
on the s9 plus you can squeeze the
device to get straight to Google
assistant which is pretty nice just sort
of squeeze the device it comes up really
easily and it's actually pretty
convenient but the other omissions are a
little bit tougher to forgive mainly the
headphone jack now without a headphone
jack on the pixel 2 XL you have to use a
USBC adapter for your wired headphones
well in terms of the handling the design
between these two is very similar
because the screens are about the same
size but I have to give some credit to
the infinity display after all the
Infinity display just curves on the
sides to bring the screen down just that
little bit to the device makes it a
little bit easier for you to go back and
forth with it but the flat sides of the
pixel 2 XL make it just that little bit
tougher to maneuver in one hand after
all you have to really slide the phone
around and really it's a small
difference but it's something that is
still noticeable as everyone has been
talking about the fingerprint reader on
the s9 plus and on the s9 really has
been put in a much better spot so we can
give the s9 credit for that and as you
can see on the back here there is a dual
camera setup on here and when we talk
about the cameras in a little
the dual camera setup is a vastly
different philosophy than the pixel to
excel the pixel to excel has been out
for a little while now so it does have
that bit of a disadvantage because it
has the snapdragon 835 with 4 gigabytes
of RAM while the Snapdragon 805 is what
you have in the s9 plus and the s9 plus
also gets a bump up to 6 gigabytes of
RAM which is pretty nice so there is a
bit of a performance gap here but it's
not so wide and also with the stock
Android that's on the pixel - you should
have reliable speedy performance
throughout your time with it especially
with this one that I've had and I've had
this thing for months you also have big
speed which is right here
I press the Bigsby button over on the
side and it takes me to the landing page
where there are a lot of pieces of
information here not only the top apps
that you might want to download op apps
that you use but also feeds you can also
hold the big speed button so that you
can do voice commands and one thing I
will give bigsby some credit for is when
you hold the button and you say
something like let me try that real
quick open the camera and take a selfie
right there one thing there you go you
have to tell me you did it sure
anyway the follow up commands are really
nice in Bixby you are able to save the
first part of a command and then do a
follow up command so depending on what
you're looking to open up it will be
able to follow through now that is
something on top of an existing Google
assistant that you get in Android Oreo
anyway by holding down on the home
button so really it just comes down to
how much you want to be able to do
between these two devices but there are
a lot of the same multitasking features
and there are a lot more features on the
galaxy s 9 plus that you may or may not
find useful so the core experience is
always going to be reliable for example
all of the extras include things like
the edge UX over here on the side coming
from the curve of the infinity display
so you can access your most contacted
contacts your most used applications and
there are a ton of options inside of the
settings area to customize the device I
even have a video a 15-second video as
my lockscreen and the always-on display
of the s 9 and the s 9 plus can be
customized with a custom picture or logo
in this case and depending on your usage
the
s9 plus and the pixel 2x I'll have very
similar capacities and their batteries
and that's very similar battery life
there's only 20 more milliamp hours in
this one so really the experience has
been largely the same I can get a day
hour a day and a half from these two
phones depending on what my usage is but
if you're a very heavy power user power
saving modes are important also
but the Samsung Galaxy S 9 plus provides
even more of those including a really
deep of power saving mode where it turns
off a lot of the features and only allow
some applications to be opened at any
given time so if you really are a super
power user you need your phone to last
as long as possible
Samsung tries to make sure that that can
happen and finally we can talk about the
cameras and there are two different
philosophies at work here like I
mentioned before we did do a camera
comparison between these two and a
couple of other phones and we are going
to provide that in a separate piece here
at Android authority the main lens has
an F 1.5 aperture and there are actual
Blaze in there that stop down to F 2.4
so you can take advantage of those two
apertures if you know what you're doing
and then there's a telephoto lens that
allows you a 2 X optical zoom at F 2.4
aperture itself the pixel 2 has a 12
megapixel camera on the rear and an 8
megapixel camera up front but both of
them have been treated to provide great
processing based upon Google's massive
database machine learning and all of
that all those buzzwords basically means
that all the photos that Google has
amassed over the years can be used to
provide the best possible processing for
any given photo that you take so even in
low-light shots the pixel 2 can provide
very detailed photos even if they're not
perfectly exposed because of the lower
specifications and by that I'm
highlighting the s 9 f 1.5 aperture
which just does a great job of really
lighting up a photo even in really dark
situations and you can see the
difference here and it also provides a
lot more options including the super
slow motion and also the AR emoji if you
want to have some extra fun with
augmented reality emojis of yourself but
those are all things that we've covered
in other videos as well where the pixel
2 really shines is in its portrait mode
especially since I'm the front-facing
camera you get the same processing where
all of the data that Google uses helps
to provide a proper cutout from the
background and also provides great
selfie photo
you've probably seen it already there
are a lot of people on Instagram and all
over the place that use this phone and
get some great front-facing camera
portraits and selfies are just that much
easier on this phone however there
aren't really any extra enhancements to
put on top of there like on the galaxy s
9 plus like beauty modes and also
enhancements like AR emoji and makeup ar
where you can actually put makeup on
yourself in an augmented reality fashion
so you can actually change kind of
completely the way that you look but
really that's the take away between
these two devices the galaxy s 9 plus
just has basically everything plus the
kitchen sink and you can pretty much ask
it to do whatever you want and it
probably has the tools to do it but the
pixel to excel still provides that kind
of Spartan experience something that's a
little bit easier for those who don't
really want too many tools because they
don't need them they know how to get
their stuff done and even if you can get
those same tasks done with the galaxy s
9 plus at least there's not a whole lot
of extra clutter surrounding everything
that you need so what really matters
here in this comparison and the reason
why you want it to take a look at these
is because we wanted to ask you guys
what you thought you can get into the
comments down below and talk about which
one of these two phones you would pick
and you can also talk about this
comparison if you have any questions at
all you can also let us know in the
comments down below and we are going to
respond to those comments down there but
also some of the top comments might
actually be used in a future piece of
content so make sure you stay tuned for
that as well so thank you guys very much
for watching I just wanted to give my
quick thoughts on these two phones and
if you haven't already please subscribe
to the Android Authority YouTube channel
and if you're already a subscriber head
over to that subscription button and hit
that bell on the side so you get
notifications for times when we put
content out which is really often
actually so keep up with all of that and
more by heading over to Android RDECOM
for all the coverage we've done on these
two phones you can eat it more
information we have the separate reviews
but we also have a longer form
comparison at Android RDECOM for you to
read so keep it tuned here and remember
that we are your source for all things
