handy the Android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly this
is episode number 163 so let's get
started Pokemon Go will have its first
in-game event for Halloween during the
next week or so you'll be able to find
spooky looking Pokemon with higher
frequency you'll also get more candy
than usual for doing the various tasks
the event lasts until November first so
you don't have much time left to take
advantage this also comes on the heels
of an update that adds some additional
features like different colored eggs and
various bug fixes Google a low receive
it's highly anticipated 2.0 update this
week the changes include direct reply
support from the notification shade as
well as multitasking support for Android
nougat it most notably didn't come with
SMS or MMS support a desktop client or
any other changes that we were really
hoping for however it is worth noting
that it took months for hangouts to get
these features as well the update is
rolling out right now Facebook announced
this week that it would stop censoring
content that is not safe for work the
catch being that it has to be newsworthy
previously the site would censor or
delete posts if it contain content that
it decided was unsuitable for general
audiences moving forward that will no
longer be the case prepare to see some
potentially graphic content the next
time it also happens to be newsworthy
Minecraft Pocket Edition received a
rather sizable update this last week the
big edition in this update was the
inclusion of add-ons these will add a
significant amount of content to the
game that wasn't there already and there
are also withers and slash commands if
you're into those this opens up the game
quite a bit especially with the new
add-ons that can add all kinds of
in-game stuff it's one of the biggest
updates the game has ever had vine is
officially shutting down the somewhat
popular network of six-second clips had
its ups and downs but was ultimately not
the cash grab that Twitter had hoped it
would be fine remains functional for
right now but it won't forever and the
company also announced they run to
playoffs to the employees those that use
the service should have ample time to
download their vine collection before it
goes kaput Twitter has had a lot of
issues here lately and this one just
seems to be the latest Necco collector
is actually just the easter-egg game
from android nougat it's an open source
port of the game
you'll be able to open up select a food
item and then wait for the cats to show
up there are hundreds to collect overall
the game is extremely low energy since
all you have to do is put food down and
then wait eventually you'll hit get a
notification telling you that a new cat
has arrived
unlike the nougat Easter Egg this one
should work on most devices and it's
free with no in-app purchases learn how
to draw as an application that houses
tons of drawing tutorials it focuses
mostly on drawing people the guides
contain things like how to draw various
parts of the body and how to bring it
all together to create a character there
are three levels including beginner
intermediate and advanced tutorials
based on your current skill level it's
also worth noting that the tutorials
were created by noted comic book artists
well Sliney you can download the
application for free to try it out masky
is a new minimal rhythm game the central
premise is that you control a dance line
and you must move the dance line back
and forth in order to acquire more
dancers there is a very lively
soundtrack that you'll get to dance to
along with that there are masks that you
can collect and upgrade as you play it
features 10 worlds to visit more than 10
songs to dance to and a whole lot more
good rhythm games are difficult to find
and this one is definitely worth
checking out
it's free to download if you are
interested OTO tools is the latest
Tasker add-on from a developer that's
made a whole ton of them
this one aims to extend the
functionality of Tasker by making
certain commands and processes easier to
create some of the things that can do is
help create toasts use OCR gestures time
calculations and even chrome custom tabs
of course Tasker is already a fairly
difficult app to use
but apps like this one should help make
it a little easier it's free to download
and use for now Batman is the latest
title out of telltale games it features
a new gritty Batman story that is told
with the same kind of structure as most
of the other telltale games titles your
decisions in the game will affect the
final outcome and most of what you'll be
doing focuses around that central
narrative it has decent graphics
semi-good controls and it seems to play
okay
many have been complaining about release
date issues so do beware of those the
game is free to download for the first
episode but you'll have to purchase the
other four when they come out for even
more Android apps news releases and
