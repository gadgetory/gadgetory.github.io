Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly this
is episode number 146 so let's roll that
intro over the last week Google Play has
been rolling out an update to the google
play store application that allows for
quicker access to beta testing apps this
is an effort to help those willing to
test out new but buggy applications
connect to developers who want someone
to test their ass before releasing if
you don't have the update yet you can
try to find the latest apk or just wait
because it is coming to you soon Walt
Mossberg reached out to Apple late last
week to find out why I message didn't
come to Android apples reply was
essentially that the service was doing
good enough already and that it was a
major selling point to buy Apple devices
of course behind all of that there is
the confirmation from Apple that Android
isn't getting I message at least not for
a long time there is a really big Google
Play sale going on right now with some
really good apps and games among them
are Phoenix for Twitter Nova Launcher
all for Grand Theft Auto games the
entire anomaly series and of course
poweramp if you've been waiting to pick
up any of these great apps or games now
is a good time to do so Tencent
purchased supercell for eight point six
billion dollars this week supercell is
known for making some of the most
popular freemium games of all time
including clash of clans clash Royale
boom beach and others this comes on the
heels of ten cents acquisition of riot
games who are the makers of League of
Legends that gives them one hell of a
portfolio to work with Facebook began
rolling out SMS support to Android
devices this last week however as per
the norm Facebook found a way to screw
it up many users who were prompted to
turn on SMS actually weren't given the
option to say no you could get away from
the pop-up by going into the settings
and then pressing the back button but
the lack of an option to say no prompted
quite the backlash after complaints
users began to see a no button and
things went back to normal for even more
Android apps and games news updates and
releases don't forget to check out this
week's newsletter which is linked in the
video description below it contains a
ton of stuff that we didn't have the
time or space for here if you'd like you
can sign up for the newsletter using the
form which is in the written companion
which is also in the video description
below and we'll send it to your inbox
every Sunday
okay folks let's take a look at the
absent games that made a big splash this
week as usual if you want to check out
any of these apps or games for yourself
you can find those links in the video
description below Bose is a new rhythm
game from Ray Ark a developer known for
making some excellent rhythm games this
one has a selection of electronica
techno and similar styles of music and
you must tap to the beat when provoked
there are also swipe hold and
directional mechanics that crap together
beautifully to create a really good
looking game the game features a
campaign mode tons of songs and you can
buy more songs if you want to through
in-app purchases if you dig rhythm games
you should definitely try this one out
footage camera is a simple camera
application that boasts a simple
interface without too much extra bloat
with it you can take pictures as per the
norm and one of its unique features is
being able to separate the focal points
from the exposure point which we found
to be a nifty little feature it has
manual controls if your phone supports
them and you can get additional features
if you go for the dollar 99 pro version
which is sold as an in-app purchase it's
surprisingly good and worth of shots
with rodeo Stampede is the latest
infinite runner from Yoda won games
makers of the acclaimed Crossy Road in
this title you'll be riding a variety of
animals and you must jump from one to
the other using your lasso in order to
remain in the game it features a lot of
the same graphical styles as Crossy Road
and the mechanics are quick to grasp for
beginners you'll also collect animals
for a collection that's viewable to
other players in the game it's a time
killer through and through but it plays
well and it looks good after three long
years ADW launcher is getting a huge
update a complete redesign and hopefully
some stability and support some of the
new features will include dynamic you I
scrolling fast scroll various additions
and changes to the various customization
options the ability to add custom made
widgets a backup manager and a whole lot
more it's currently in beta so if you
want to check it out you'll have to join
the ADW beta in the Google Play Store
and we'll have a link for that in the
video description below never alone kai
addition is avery release of the popular
and critically acclaimed never alone
game except for this one is for pretty
much all smartphones and this one you
play as nunu and her pet fox aptly named
Fox the two of you will work together to
make it through each level it bills
itself as an atmospheric puzzle
platformer which means you'll be doing a
lot of jumping and a lot of puzzle
solving this
Roy line is quite touching the graphics
are pretty decent and it's an overall
enjoyable game to play best of all there
are no in-app purchases and that about
does it for this one folks if you want
to keep watching we'll have chases
latest video about artificial
intelligence linked up there on the
screen and in the video description
below don't forget to sign up for that
