Android authority and we've taken a look
at the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 7.0 which is
the smallest tablet of the bunch but now
it's time to step it up a notch and take
a look at the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 8.0
alright so I want to start this video
off with a quick disclaimer and let you
guys know that a lot of the stuff that
was mentioned in the review for the
Galaxy Tab 4 7.0 is going to be echoed
throughout this review for the Galaxy
Tab 4 8.0 most because these two tablets
are essentially the same thing there are
some minor differences outside of the
display size and I will mention what
those are but other than that they're
really pretty much exactly the same
tablets but with that being said let's
go ahead and get started
so let's get right into it starting off
with the design and it's exactly what
you might expect from a Samsung device
it's entirely made of plastic and it
features the same fake leather texture
on the back that Samsung has adopted
since the note 3 but it doesn't really
feel like leather it just feels like
hard plastic it's a little bit thinner
than the 7-inch model coming in at 8
millimeters and it's fairly lightweight
making it easy to hold for long periods
of time just make sure to hold on to it
carefully because while the back is
textured it actually doesn't help all
that much in terms of providing extra
grip despite the plastic construction
it feels very solid in the hand and
doesn't look so cheap like many Samsung
products tend to do Samsung's always
been known for imitating other materials
with plastic namely Chrome and the
Galaxy Tab 4 lineup is no exception but
they've actually done a great job with
slimming down the chrome to a very thin
lip around the bezels
I've never been a huge fan of Samsung's
continued use on Chrome on all of their
products so I'm hoping this slight
design change is going to be something
that continues on to their future
products like maybe the note 4 or even
the Samsung Galaxy s6 all the ports are
located on the top bottom and right
sides leaving the left side completely
blank but on the right side you'll find
the standard power and volume keys which
are very tactile and responsive with
great feedback an IR blaster in the
middle for control your TV and a micro
SD card slot which supports up to 64
gigs if you need that extra storage on
top is a 3.5 millimeter headset jack and
following along the bottom is your
standard micro USB port on the front
above the display is a 1.3 megapixel
front-facing camera and that's pretty
much all there is at the top there's no
notification light or ambient light
sensors so it's pretty basic along the
bottom is Samsung's standard button
layout with their signature home button
in the middle with capacitive recent
apps and back buttons on the left and
right which for some reason aren't
backlit so they're a little bit
difficult to find if you're using the
tablet in the dark on the back towards
bottom is two small slits for the single
speaker and it's the same exact speaker
that can be found on the 7-inch model
it's not the loudest thing in the world
but you really shouldn't expect it to be
the sound is decent for what it is but
to be honest it's nothing that's going
to blow you away and the placement on
the back means you'll have to have the
tablet face down when you want to listen
to music or have the tablet propped up
in order to not muffle the sound when
watching videos or movies flipping back
around to the front is the 8 inch
display with a resolution of 1280 by 800
it's not the same super high resolution
and pixel dense display that can be
found on Samsung's pro series of tablets
so you're definitely going to notice
pixels especially when reading text or
playing games and with the same
resolution spread across a slightly
larger display the pixel density does
take a hit making pixels a little bit
more noticeable the display overall is
still rather enjoyable though as color
reproduction viewing angles and outdoor
visibility are all quite good
making playing games or watching movies
a very pleasurable experience due to the
8 inch display the overall size of the
tablet is a little bit larger than its 7
inch brother which is to be expected so
it's not going to fit in your back
pocket like the 7 inch model would but
it'll still easily fit in a book bag and
the relatively thin bezels on the side
make it really easy to hold in one hand
and operate with the other which is
something that you can't do quite as
easily on larger tablets on the inside
the Galaxy Tab 4 8.0 is being powered by
a 1.2 gigahertz quad-core processor with
1.5 gigabytes of RAM and 16 gigabytes of
internal storage which is double what
you get on the tab for 7.0 so if you
need that extra internal storage then it
might be better to spring for the 8.0
the specs aren't mind-blowing but it
performs well through regular everyday
tasks like swiping through home screens
opening up apps and multitasking with
very little hiccups and I'm not exactly
sure what it is because the specs are
exactly the same across the entire tab
for lineup but the lag that I
encountered within the gallery on the
tab for 7.0 doesn't exist
on the 8.0 the gallery opens up
immediately and scrolling through the
photos isn't choppy and slow and I was
able to play graphically demanding games
like dead trigger 2 without frames
dropping every few seconds so I can't
really explain why the 8.00 performs
considered better but I'm not really
complaining the camera around back is a
3 megapixel fixed-focus shooter with no
LED flash so it's a very basic camera
it's there if you really want to take
pictures with your tablet but I imagine
that most people way sticking to their
smartphones for picture taking on-the-go
the camera interface gives you only the
essential features so the functionality
is very limited compared to what you
would get on something like the galaxy
s5 but you still get some of the most
basic and useful shooting modes like
beauty face sound and shot panorama
sports and night mode picture quality is
exactly what you might expect from a 3
megapixel camera they're very low
resolution so you're not going to be
able to zoom and crop without losing a
lot of detail color reproduction
surprisingly looks decent though it's
pretty accurate and true to life but
other than that there's not much else
that's good about this camera it
performs best when outdoors but once you
go inside photos become extremely noisy
especially in low light and the fixed
focus makes it virtually impossible to
take clear close-up shots next up is the
battery life and the Galaxy Tab 4 8.0 is
packing a four thousand four hundred
fifty milliamp hour battery and during
my time using it I was very impressed
with the battery life I consider myself
to be a very heavy user when it comes to
tablets I primarily only use them for
gaming with a little bit of YouTube
watching and browsing the web but even
with my usage I still managed to get a
couple of days out of it with close to
seven-and-a-half hours of screen on time
so I'm pretty satisfied with the battery
life and I have no doubts that with
regular everyday usage you could easily
get at least 3 to 4 days out of it
before having to recharge it on the
software side of things the tab 48.0
ships with the latest version of Android
4.4.2 kitkat with Samsung's TouchWiz
interface on top and TouchWiz is still
TouchWiz with all the nature sound
effects that you know and love but it's
a much lighter version of touch
compared to what you get on something
like the Galaxy s5 or the pro line of
tablets there's no camera shortcut on
the lockscreen
Fura toggles built into the notification
shade and most notably Samsung is my
magazine or magazine UX is not present
here the more useful functions of
TouchWiz however are still here like
multi window if you want to be able to
truly multitask palmas white for taking
a screenshot and smart stay to keep the
display on for as long as you are
looking at it Samsung's TouchWiz isn't
necessarily my favorite skin out there
but it's really not all that bad
it's certainly gotten better but there's
still some things that need work like
the settings menu with its tabbed
interface that makes it difficult to
quickly find what you're looking for and
the folder animations that only get
slower and slower the more apps you have
inside the folder the Galaxy Tab 4 8.0
is available now in both black and white
for a price of $270 but it's currently
on sale right now as of this video
through Amazon for $240 so if you want
to take advantage of that now might be
the best time to do it personally I
still think a tablet like the Nexus 7 is
a better bang for your buck unless you
really need that microSD card expansion
and a slightly larger display but with a
nexus 7 you're getting a higher
resolution display a faster processor
updates directly from Google and a
slightly better camera for whatever
that's worth
but there you have it for the Samsung
Galaxy Tab 4 8.0 it's another mid-range
tablet from Samsung's Galaxy Tab lineup
and while it offers decent performance
and overall good looking display despite
its resolution and great battery life
the price tag might be tough to swallow
even if it is on sale right now it isn't
a bad tablet as far as tablets are
concerned but it is hard to recommend
especially with competitors offering
considerably better options for less
money but that is pretty much it
