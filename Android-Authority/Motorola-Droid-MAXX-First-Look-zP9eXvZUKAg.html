here checking out the Droid Maxx in New
York
both the Motorola Droid Maxx and the
Droid ultra seem to be fighting for the
top spot in the new Droid lineup on one
hand things are very similar between the
two phones both have 5 inch 720p
displays both had the same software and
even hardware for the most part right
down to the build the Droid Maxx has a
very similar look shape and feel to the
ultra with one major difference it's
heavier and thicker it's still thinner
than the RAZR MAXX HD but compared to
the ultra it's 8 and 1/2 millimeter body
is kind of chunky that said it's still
way thinner than a whole lot of phones
out there the entire new Droid lineup
shares some very key hardware so the max
uses the same Motorola x8 mobile
computing system as the other phones
this technology uses two cores for
general application tasks while four
cores are dedicated a graphics
processing one of the remaining cores is
used for language processing while the
other is used for contextual computing
which essentially means sensors another
feature all of these phones share is the
camera with 2 megapixels upfront and 10
megapixels in the rear
using Motorola's clear pixel rgbc
cameras which are supposed to offer
better low-light performance where the
max really gains headway is its massive
3500 milliamp hour battery while
Motorola's previous battery hero
provided 32 hours of use the company
claims that the Droid Maxx can handle 48
hours of use so leave town for the
weekend without the charger no big deal
that battery life does come with a price
though the max is the most expensive of
the new Droid line running $2.99 with a
contract you can pre-order the phone
right now and it'll be on sale starting
August 20th stay tuned to android
authority for more info on the max and
the rest of Verizon's new Droid line</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
