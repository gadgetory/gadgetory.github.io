clayton young bird coming at you once
again for your number one source for all
things android android authority calm
today we've got an unboxing of the brand
new xperia ion by sony this is Sony's
first 4G LTE smartphone this is
available for AT&amp;amp;T we're just gonna go
ahead and get into the unboxing check it
out you can see right here on the side
of the box we have our awesome little
off spec sheet this has the Bravia
Engine it is PlayStation Certified of
course it has Wi-Fi what device doesn't
these days anyways we've of course
powered by Android we have a 12
megapixel camera with 3d panorama mode
and we've got a 4.7 inch beautiful
display on this so anyways let's just
check out what comes in the box here a
cool little message there texting and
driving it can wait really awesome
feeling phone will set this aside just
for a second I'm very eager to play with
this anyways the rest of the contents in
the box we have our AC adapter our
charger and then some information who
cares about all that stuff let's check
out this awesome Xperia ion pull off
this little prompt here and we'll pull
off the back in this well we've got a
nice lens cover for our 12 megapixel
camera which is always great to see they
took the time to protect their beautiful
Hardware anyways our four point six inch
diagonally measured screen is going to
be beautiful when we start it up so we
will just hold the power button here get
it going so you have awesome Sony now
this has a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core
processor it's got 16 gigabytes of
internal memory and it has the microSD
expansion slot one so anyways phones
booted up it's awesome we're running
Android 2 dot 3 so that's just a little
bit behind the curve but the hardware
more than makes up for that now the
display on the Xperia ion is a 4.6 inch
HD and they call it the reality display
and this actually it looks great for HD
content we have our HDMI port right here
on the side of the body we've got many
hdmi and then um
mini USB for charging here's our camera
a nice Xperia logo there on the side
here we have our dedicated camera button
we also have our volume rocker and our
power on button up atop the device we do
have our headphone jack three point five
millimeters got a small mic here on
bottom so let's do a quick look at the
software of course we always have the
full review after I've had plenty of
time to get to know the device so we're
not going to go into too much of the
software specifics today anyways it
looks like we have some nice native Sony
widgets so my sony toggles there comes
pre-loaded with AT&amp;amp;T apps as well as one
might expect from an ATT 18t phone
excuse me we do have our 4G on right now
there are nice weather widget and scroll
through we don't have infinite scrolling
will go into our app drawer here so we
have some file managers right there go
back got our browser of course comes
pre-loaded with Facebook it looks like a
teen teen navigator all of our gmt apps
go through go through the settings just
check out basic theme for the settings
we have our xperia dedicated settings of
connectivity and then facebook inside
xperia like i said earlier the phone is
running the android 237 hopefully the
season ICS update pretty soon and I'm
sure after a little digging in the
developer community we can get this
phone rooted and show some ICS roms
maybe even jelly bean but I'm not
guaranteeing anything but stay tuned for
that you guys anyways this is the sony
xperia ion came with our sony xperia
smart tags as well as we're going to be
demoing those getting you a full review
of the xperia ion and then testing out
all of its hardware and software putting
it up against some of the best devices
out today as well that's including the
samsung galaxy s3 also the LG optimus 4x
HD if you guys ever have any requests go
ahead and drop us a line leave us a
comment or visit our website and tell us
what you want to see anyways guys thanks
