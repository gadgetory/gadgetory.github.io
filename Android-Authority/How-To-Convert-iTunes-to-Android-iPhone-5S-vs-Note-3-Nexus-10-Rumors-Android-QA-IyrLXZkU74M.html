Jason this is where we try and answer
your most pressing Android questions
like how do I transfer my iTunes library
of music to an Android device and
someone who is confused about whether or
not to buy the iPhone 5s or the Samsung
Galaxy Note 3 you realize my friend
these are entirely different phones they
are not comparable one is like a Honda
Civic and the other one's a Hummer first
question comes from Aziz who's been very
persistent and adamant about getting
updates and news about the Nexus 10 hey
Jase emailed you about the next Nexus 10
what's happening about it I want to buy
a tablet and I want to wait for that one
but I don't want to wait too long or
regret buying something else well as
these I haven't answered you because we
try and not deal in rumor questions in
the Android Q&amp;amp;A because what we do with
rumors we want to make sure we have some
real credible substance behind it but I
know you've been very persistent and you
want the answer so here is what we have
so far the leaked information originally
came from an anonymous and unverified
third-party tipster and interestingly
enough though both easy leaks and Pocket
lint have since removed the alleged
images and specs while neither of these
publications specifically mentioned why
they pulled down the information it's
pretty obvious that the leaked device
was likely fake well as these you really
want to take that info with a grain of
salt but you can look in the show links
below and I have a link to android
authority comm where it gives you more
details about all the information we
have about the nexus 10
Benjamin toe had an SD card question hi
Jase do you know how I can change the
default storage to the SD card instead
of my device storage so Benjamin
unfortunately there's no reliable way to
get all your apps and content to default
store to your SD card you have to do it
on a per app basis to do that you first
go to settings then to application
manager slide over to on SD card select
the app and select move to SD card now
there are other ways to do this but it
does require root access this is really
the simplest method so let's talk to
Mooney about whether or not he should
consider the iPhone 5s or the Galaxy
Note 3 no ice sheet bashing please so
Mooney if this is going to be your
primary device meaning
you don't have a tablet used on a
regular basis you're gonna use this
phone to read watch movies and as a
phone then you might consider the Galaxy
Note 3 I have not talked to anybody who
has a Galaxy Note 3 that does not like
it everyone seems to like it but they
are all phablet fans I would not be a
fan of the Galaxy Note 3 for my own
personal use because I use tablets so
much I want a small compact phone to
complement it I don't want a big phablet
and a tablet they're too similar right
now I also use iOS 7 on a regular basis
on my iPad Mini and I use the Nexus 7
all on a daily basis I like iOS 7 there
are many things that are good about it
and if you like a small form-factor you
like gorgeous you know build quality you
want something that's fast and reliable
the iPhone 5s may be for you now there
are people out there that just are into
this stuff and they want the power and
flexibility of Android so you got to ask
yourself what kind of experience you
want but know these phones are
completely different experiences let me
know what you get and how you like it
good luck money next question speaks to
a common problem when people are moving
from iOS to Android how do they move
their iTunes library neo illusion asks
hey Jace can you recommend some iTunes
alternatives to listen to music and sync
data so yes and the solution is
doubleTwist I've used it for a number of
years I've bought all their upgrades
they're fantastic
you do need to download it not just to
your Android device but to your desktop
whether it's a Mac or PC then within the
double toast program you drag and drop
from the iTunes library to your Android
device now it's not just a good syncing
tool from iOS to Android it's also just
a good media player for both music and
podcasts check it out and let me know
what you think thanks for watching
Android army and today's show question
to win the t-shirt wherever you are in
the world is the following you hear a
lot of rumors about the upcoming Galaxy
s5 but I'm asking you to take an
educated guess on what those specs will
be will there be a curved display will
it have an iris scan or a fingerprint
scanner will it have a Snapdragon 800 or
at 805 give us in one or two sentences
your educated guess
why you think Samsung will choose those
specs good luck to all of you love to
connect with you here on Google+ or
Android you don't what I forget about my
brother's an Android Josh Joe in the
tech ninja Kevin and Christopher's back
we got to welcome him back
good luck and I shall see you in the
next and we're to a</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
