handy from Android Authority comm we are
nearing the end of the month so it's
time to round up the best games that
were released in May of 2016
Assassin's Creed identity is an action
RPG that's set in the universe of the
acclaimed franchise you'll be able to
create your own character customize them
and level them up as you see fit it has
excellent graphics and decent gameplay
complete with various missions and
quests loot gear and various locations
to explore the game is pretty good but
it is new and has seen a few release
date bugs that have kept people from
enjoying it as much as they could be so
do be aware of that the jeweled Stars is
the latest iteration of the bejeweled
series like the others this one is a
puzzle board gamer you must match the
shapes in order to clear the board
unlike previous versions this one has a
shifting game board that can either make
things easier or more difficult
depending on the situation you can also
get power-ups and there is a set of
bejeweled themed emoji that you can
unlock it's a freemium game but it's not
overly bad it has some charming graphics
seasoned mechanics and plenty of content
to unlock you'll be able to find various
animals that you can play with and as
with most games its Odyssey is a fun
little puzzle game where you have to
avoid a bunch of self-replicating robots
by running around on a planet the game
includes five characters 90 levels they
get more challenging as you go a star
system that awards you up to 100 stars
in each level and a lot more with all of
that it provides quite a bit of gameplay
the controls are pretty unique but only
require one finger which makes it simple
to play with one hand after a long time
and a ton of imitations we finally have
a Pokemon Trading Card Game on mobile
the sad news is that it's not altogether
different from the other trading card
games you'll build a deck duel other
people and then you'll be given more
cards to expand your collection you'll
be able to build your own decks and
enter into tournaments as well the whole
game is played online against other
players and as you may have guessed the
in-app purchases allow you to purchase
more cards Blue Man Singh Saga 2 was
originally released in Japan on the
Super Famicom and was never actually
given an English release until now
the mobile version contains the entire
game along with remastered graphics and
a remastered soundtrack the story goes
that your to help build up a kingdom and
defeat the seven heroes who have
returned as demons it also includes new
gameplay elements such as new character
classes and new game+ and a lot more
it's mighty expensive but there are no
in-app purchases super phantom cat is an
ode to the platformer games of old it
features retro style graphics and a
variety of mechanics you will likely
recognize from other games from many
years ago there is a quirky little plot
that you'll be able to follow which adds
a little bit of depth along with that
you'll have fully customizable controls
multiple characters and plenty of levels
to play through the game has two in-app
purchases which give you energy drinks
and one to unlock special characters to
achieve Panda heroes is the spiritual
successor to Taichi Panda both of them
are MMO style action RPGs that allows
you to gather whole parties of
characters explore various locations and
complete various missions in classic MMO
style it also allows for co-op mode
where you can battle raid bosses
together with friends and you can join
guilds so you can play with the same
people it's a fun little adventure with
some decent graphics but it does have a
few release date issues reported so do
be aware of those Uncharted fortune
hunter is a puzzle game that plays a lot
like Laura Croft go you'll be
controlling the venerable Nathan Drake
as you solve puzzles collect treasures
and avoid certain death the game
contains over 200 levels contains over
50 treasures to collect and the graphics
are pretty decent the game is still new
and is experiencing signing issues with
PSN but those should be ironed out over
time the vector 2 is one of the more
unique platformers available right now
much like its predecessor it's a
platformer with parkour elements where
you must jump around on all sorts of
obstacles to avoid being captured by the
proverbial man this iteration features
gear that you can find an equip stunts
that you can perform and a lot more it
does run on a much more aggressive
freemium system than the first game
which has made some people
understandably angry but it is worth a
shot
and that about does it for this one
