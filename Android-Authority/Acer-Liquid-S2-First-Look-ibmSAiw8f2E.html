Authority what's going on everybody and
we have a bit of an interesting one here
we are at the acer booth over at Pep com
digital focus here at Aoife in Berlin at
the grand hyatt in beautiful potsdamer
platz and so we're taking a look at the
acer liquid s2 so what we're looking at
here is a six inch screen device and yes
this is a this is a bit of a phone
tablet hybrid a phablet if you will even
though I'm not kind of that word but
anyway so the liquid s2 has a six inch
screen that is capable of 1080p
resolution inside of an IPS display so
you're getting some real brightness here
so I have the brightness turned down
quite a bit because it really coming
over powers things and it really is a
very bright display you can see here
that it gets really crazy so what we
have here
so what we have here is the OS that is
mostly like stockings right yeah but if
this is definitely Android 4.2 point2
what we're looking at under the hood is
a Snapdragon 800 processor underneath
that 5-inch display 16 gigabytes of
on-board storage and training looking
around we do have a camera up here that
the main thing that they're saying here
at acer is at this the main thing be
marketed it records 4k video one of the
first phones to be able to record full
4k video it's really really crazy that
that is possible on this smartphone in
any case we're looking around the actual
body itself you see that we have soft
keys down here on the bottom the one
thing that I thought was a little bit
odd the one for one thing when you hold
this six-inch phone in your hand it does
feel pretty hefty there is a real girl
to it it does it does really door 5-inch
screen devices in terms of handling
because it's kind of hard to reach the
sides but nonetheless it is actually a
pretty nice sleek looking phone there is
a red accent right here but there is
actually another device that another
version of this rather that is
incompletely hotrod red it's really cool
and we're going to take a look at that
one in a little bit also the button
layout is a little bit odd mainly
because of the power button instead of
having it on the side where you were
sort of expected them to land it is at
the top right over here so you have the
power button right around here and that
sort turns it on and off so having that
all the way up there you really have to
reach for it but that's really just the
only really grow a real bright that I
have when it comes to this nonetheless
this is the acer liquid s2 it's a it's a
pretty good entry from Acer especially
in terms of the high-end specifications
and that super powerful camera that is
able to report ok video so we're taking
a look at some of the options here
widescreen off and on keeps it pretty
simple so
go so it looks like we're working with a
10 megapixel camera here so right now
we're at six min six min you know what
we can go to 10 there you go 10
megapixel camera at widescreen with it
on you have a few options over here
in order to turn on there's a flashlight
mode and we actually got blinded by it
when someone was using it over on the
side over here you can see here it says
the record mode could be either full HD
or you have this ultra HD 4k 2k and that
is incredible how its able to record
just that kind of that kind of footage
is going to make some really really big
files if i were to record it right now
and try to transfer it over so it will
say this once we get our hands on this
actual device we are going to take a
look at the quality of that video and
just how good it is so stay tuned for
that because once we have it you'll see
just how awesome 4k video could be and
then on underneath the surface you have
an OS that is simplistic I might seem a
little bloated it's just my opinion but
nonetheless it does come with a number
of nice features while still looking
pretty stock anyway that is the acer
liquid s2 as always thank you guys for
watching we are here at f calm digital
focus at Aoife in berlin we're going to
have a lot more coverage right over the
coming day so make sure you stay tuned
to android authority because we are your
source for all things android
