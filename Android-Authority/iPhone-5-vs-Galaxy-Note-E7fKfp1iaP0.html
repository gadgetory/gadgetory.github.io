android authority we're reporting live
from hong kong we're bringing the iphone
5 vs the Galaxy Note 2 today oh my
goodness basically guys these are two
totally different devices but that
doesn't matter because people want to
know what's a better device obviously
not the total affairs comparison this
device is brand spanking new from apple
features of really fast processor tons
of improvements inside the latest
version what we have here obviously is
the device that was released way back in
October of 2011 so obviously a much
older device but let's just roll with it
and do the vs smackdown iphone 5 force
Galaxy Note so starting off obviously
let's talk about the dimensions we have
five point seven eight inches tall on
the Galaxy Note making it very very
large for a lot of people at three point
two seven inches wide in terms of its
thickness we have zero point three eight
inches of thickness not too bad
considering it's a 5.3 inch device on
the iPhone 5 we have four point eight
and four point eight seven inches of
height we have 2.31 inches of width and
we have zero point three inches of
thickness or thinnest so 0.3 inches of
thickness on the iphone five and zero
point three eight inches in thickness on
the galaxy note and sorry for the the
paint back guys anyway so bring it back
on the wait for the galaxy note we have
180 grams of total weight for the iphone
5 we only have 112 making it
significantly lighter in terms of the
processor inside we have a dual core 1.4
gigahertz XE nose for the international
version or the snapdragon s3 for the LTE
version which is north american bound
for the iphone we have a apple a6
dual-core 1000 megahertz processor and
don't let those 1000 mega hertz fool you
know this is a really really powerful
device and in fact is actually just as
fast if not faster in some cases as the
galaxy s3 but that's so important for
the purposes of this comparison we're
only going to be looking to devices so
bring it down for one for the GALEX you
know we have one gigabyte of ram
for the iphone 5 we have one gigabyte of
RAM too so they're comfortable in that
area now with the resolution Rogalla
kino we have 1280 pixels by 800 the
highest resolution at the time when oil
is released of any device for the iphone
5 we have a weird but high resolution of
1136 pixels by 640 in terms of ppi for
the iphone 5 we have 326 pixels per inch
making it a very dense display with the
galaxy note we have 285 PPI or pixels
per inch now in terms of storage for the
galaxy note we're looking at 16 and 32
gigabytes ah but it has expandable
memory so we can have up to 32 gigabytes
plus the 64 gigabyte card making it a
very versatile and flexible device for
those of you that love media consumption
on the fly and the ability to just
pretty much get whatever you want on
there both have really fluid operation I
would have to give the cake to the
iphone it is just really really really
smooth other than that moving on to
battery we have a whopping twenty-five
hundred million battery on the galaxy
note on the iphone 5 we have only 1400
milliamp battery but considering their
profile and their difference of screen
size obviously makes a lot of sense the
galaxy note if you use it intensely
you're going to get about six hours of
non-stop web browsing wears on the
iphone you're probably going to get
about the same but five point three
inches versus four right so it makes
sense moving down we have a removable
battery on the galaxy note so you're
going to battery extender I've seen
third-party batteries as large as 5,300
milla be provided I'll be a through ebay
and whatnot but the point is is that you
can add a battery you can have a couple
of batteries with you we all know the
benefits of expandable memory and
expandable or replaceable batteries most
batteries of this nature the nickel
cadmium or the lithium-ion the lithium
polymer that's in both of these they do
tend to deplete their half life comes in
and around 500 cycles so from there on
in after about a year depending on how
many times you charge it may be less
than a year you're going to be looking
at less battery life as time goes
forward in that case you're basically
well I can't really say that on youtube
but you're going to be having a lot less
battery life with the
phone but with the Galaxy Note obviously
you can buy a new battery other than
that in terms of optics we're looking at
eight megapixel cameras for both and
both are capable about capturing
stunning images particularly in
highlight the low-light the low light
sensor that Apple's been able to
incorporate it's supposed to be quite
good we'll have to test that out in
another comparison but both are 8
megapixel regardless for the
front-facing camera the Galaxy Note 2
features the leading 2 megapixel so for
skype chats and for other things voice
chat video chat you're going to have a
much higher resolution if the bandwidth
allows on the Galaxy Note whereas with
the iphone 5 it's only 1 point 2
megapixel they cheaped out on you guys a
little bit there you know anyway moving
it down we have NFC Near Field
Communication on the galaxy note which
is in the most common use but it's nice
to have for future expandability down
the line a lot of cool stuff can come
there but it's getting held up for a
couple of reasons which I'll detail
another post later either way we have
any see on the galaxy note no NFC on the
iphone 5 moving down to connectivity so
we have LTE capability for the internet
for the u.s. specific version of this
device and for korean version and for
international version we have hsdpa plus
both feature Wi-Fi for the galaxy note
and this one comes with bluetooth 4.0
out of the box for the iphone 5 it is an
LTE specific and capable device and it
also runs with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0
the galaxy note is a unique product
there's no doubt about it created a new
product category phablet you know it's
catching on there's a ton of competitors
out there we see devices getting larger
and larger but this device at the time
it was released in october last year
2011 it was a true trailblazer and some
people thought it was ridiculous I mean
not even the largest hands can touch
that top corner I mean you'd really have
to be like a UFC Superman to do it but
that's not the point for media for
browsing you know just for overall
consumption of content for creative
types people that just love him in the
most rich experience and immersive
experience possible the Galaxy Note and
the soon to come galaxy note 2 really do
take the cake for that but for those
seeking perhaps more versatile
or mmm how would I say just easier
one-handed operation you know you can
just pound as a quick note one-handed on
this let's just do a new one let's just
open up our mail here okay let's not
open up on my own let's just make a new
note so what is the best android oh
pretty good let's do that one handed
what is the best oops obviously a little
bit slower okay not bad now of course on
this bad boy it's going to be
significantly more challenging in fact
I'm not gonna bother showing you let's
do nascimento that's where this bed what
comes in the blaze the s-pen right a lot
of people love this thing particularly
creative types people that love to make
notes we got some AI up in here it's
nice to have the pen if you like to
capture notes or you have the little
creative idea in there want to take a
picture let's do something from the
gallery it doesn't really matter point
is with the S Pen you have a lot of
versatility and flexibility and that's
good the iphone 5 doesn't have that kind
of functionality and it's likely that
iphone never really will that's not the
point these are two totally different
products but people still want to know
for comparison they reached out to us
and asked us to do it footprint of the
device is substantially different
obviously the iphone is very functional
for one hand and the no.2 not so much so
moving on you know we have android ICS
4.0 for on the Galaxy Note right now
it's going to come with jellybean a
little bit down the line we have the
Galaxy Note 2 coming out in a couple
weeks here so obviously this product
will be faded away but for now it's
still going to be a great deal it can be
had in some markets for as low as 350
300 second hand which makes it quite a
steal for those who love gaming movies
web browsing it's one of the best
devices out there obviously Samsung has
their whole s-pen sweet the premium
suite has come and there's a ton of
style of specific apps that are being
released they released the sdk for
developers so a lot of really innovative
functions that are coming for the s pen
and have already
already so in terms of pricing we have
199 299 and 399 for the iphone 5 and the
galaxy o has been faded out but you can
buy it on long roughly for around five
hundred forty dollars sometimes cheaper
on amazon and whatnot so the oxy note
actually saw really strong sales like i
said to pioneer new category sold over
10 million worldwide there's a ton of
imitators out there the s-pen was a
unique feature that a lot of people
really appreciate it where some they
just kind of let it stay dormant within
the iphone 5 on the other hand is the
probably likely going to be the best
selling device best selling mobile
smartphone device in the future they
sold two million in 24 hours as soon as
it was released the pre-orders just got
jammed third party sites everyone tried
they went down here we were in Hong Kong
trying to get it and the lineups were
astounding either way we were able to
secure one for you guys because that's
what we do obviously substantially
lighter than the original iphone
nineteen percent lighter excuse me
nineteen percent thinner significantly
thinner in fact on the larger screen of
four inches iOS 6 comes with a lot of
improvements to the architecture but
there are a couple negatives to like a
redesigned App Store that a lot of
people are uncomfortable with the map
solution has been switched away from
google and from what I've heard and what
I'm seeing so far it is vastly inferior
so that's a bad move on Apple's part but
it's a strategic one for them to
separate themselves from google as they
are fierce competitors obviously we know
that android is pretty much the most
popular Android excuse me operating
system in the world now with over 1.4
million activations daily but we have to
appreciate competition competition
between these two major ecosystems and
soon maybe Windows Phone 8 to come is a
good thing for us consumers it pushes
the envelope better specs lower prices
more features boom boom boom boom boom
we want to foster competition but as it
stands right now androids on over
sixty-seven percent almost seventy
percent globally of devices being
activated or his iphone is just dropping
and dropping around sixteen seventeen
percent right now
so building materials how much does it
cost to make the iphone cost 200 seven
bucks to make the iphone and how much
are they selling for basically three and
a half times that so they're making a
lot of money for the Galaxy Note costs
about two hundred forty dollars to me so
a little bit more you know and what
we're looking at here is an AMOLED
display AMOLED and it stands for active
matrix oxygen light-emitting diode it's
a different display technology kind of
like plasma vs LCD richer colors deeper
blacks but less bright whites so let's
just do a quick comparison of the
browsers here we've cleared the cache
we're just going to open up the native
browser where are we at here okay there
it is and for here so far an Internet
both are fluid let's just bring up
android authority column here and droid
excuse me
okay need to spray it with an iphone
here okay so three two one go
excuse me guys we didn't set up the
Wi-Fi on this my bad okay let's just do
a quick clear the cache on this bad boy
going so far here clear cookies in data
okay just bring up the wife I'm just
going to put the password in here for a
sec
now we did actually do a drop test the
iphone 5 today and I really have to hand
it to apple they made so many
improvements to the design of the Vice
it is reka believe dropped it four times
from Heights from two feet six inches
all the way up and it would it didn't
break the screen didn't break when we
dropped it with purses the s3 both broke
but it's completely redesigned they have
what appears to be some kind of membrane
that is encasing the device and then the
ice polycarbonate metal makes it lighter
and extremely strong it still is a glass
display I bid it to confirm and it is
glass but it has a metal back beautiful
design very ergonomic remarkably like
there's no doubt that a ton of time
people are going to love it so here we
go back to the browser test here ok so
we cleared the cache on both as I said
and let's just start up again just to
see how it performs ok
okay and draw it Oh thority calm bring
the best mandroid every day guys okay
there we go together okay great balls
off to the same start while the Galaxy
Note seems to be ripping forward okay
remember the cash is clear this is the
fair test and the iphone 5 Pierce with
low to the CSS things are coming in okay
pictures not finished galaxy knows doing
really impressively now this does have
ICS so it's pretty quick but not as
quick as jellybeans and check out our
galaxy nexus vs iphone 5 to see some
really fluid browsing alright well it
looks like that from 51 that's not a
surprise guys this has an a6 processor
and the benchmark show but this is
actually powerful so powerful in fact
that is even more powerful than the
galaxy s3 with a quad-core 1.4 gigahertz
sexy nose and this only has a dual core
galaxy one only one point for gamers
dual porn so in terms of fluidity
operation you have to really give it to
apple they have something really
remarkable they're so fluid it's just so
nice to use galaxy no one is really good
too but it just doesn't touch what we
have with the iphone but this is capable
of running flash and that's something
that phone can't do and of course flash
is being phased out but it's nice to
have choices right don't want update so
other than that we're just taking a look
at the galaxy note in the hand obviously
really really large the iphone nice and
convenient but but small so it's up to
you guys it's personal preference we
just want to offer you a versus to give
your hands on perspective what it's like
you can basically almost fit like two
iphones in the galaxy now but very very
different profile different products
different categories so this is the
first hands-on comparison of baffles
brand spanking new iphone 5 vs an older
device the galaxy note from android
