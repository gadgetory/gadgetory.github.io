adroit authority we're reporting live
from Hong Kong
we're bringing the iPhone 5 versus the
Galaxy Note 2 today oh my goodness
basically guys these are two totally
different devices but that doesn't
matter because people want to know
what's a better device obviously not the
totally fairest comparison this device
is brand spanking new from Apple
features of really fast processor tons
of improvements inside the latest
version what we have here obviously is
the device that was released way back in
October of 2011 so obviously a much
older device but let's just roll with it
and do the vs. smackdown iphone 5 vs
galaxy note so starting off obviously
let's talk about the dimensions we have
five point seven eight inches tall on
the galaxy note making a very very large
for a lot of people at three point two
seven inches wide in terms of its
thickness
we have 0.38 inches of thickness not too
bad to Syrians of 5.3 inch device on the
iPhone 5 we have four point eight and
four point eight seven inches of height
we have two point three one inches of
width and we have 0.3 inches of
thickness or thinness so 0.3 inches of
thickness on the iPhone 5 and 0.38
inches in thickness on the galaxy note
and sorry for the the paint back guys
anyway so bring it back on the weight
for the galaxy note we have 180 grams of
total weight for the iPhone 5 we only
have 112 making it significantly lighter
in terms of the processor inside we have
a dual-core 1.4 gigahertz Exynos for the
international version or the snapdragon
s3 for the LTE version which is north
american bound for the iphone we have a
Apple a6 dual core 1,000 megahertz
processor and don't let those 1,000
megahertz fool you know uh this is a
really really powerful device and in
fact is actually just as fast if not
faster in some cases as the galaxy s3
but that's so important for the purposes
of this comparison we're only gonna be
looking two devices so bringing it down
for one for the galaxy you know we have
one gigabyte of RAM
for the iPhone 5 we have one gigabyte of
RAM - so they're comfortable in that
area now with a resolution for the
galaxy know we have 1280 pixels by 800
the highest resolution at the time
winner was released of any device for
the iPhone 5 we have a weird but high
resolution of 11 36 pixels by 640 in
terms of PPI for the iPhone 5 we have
326 pixels per inch making it a very
dense display for the galaxy note we
have 285 PPI or pixels per inch now in
terms of storage for the galaxy note
we're looking at 16 and 32 gigabytes but
it has expandable memory so we can have
up to 32 gigabytes plus the 64 gigabyte
card making it a very versatile and
flexible device for those of you that
love media consumption on the fly and
the ability to just pretty much get
whatever you want on there both have
really fluid operation I would have to
give the cake to the iPhone it is just
really really really smooth
other than that moving on to battery we
have a whopping 2500 milliamp battery on
the galaxy note on the iPhone 5
we have only 1400 milliamp battery but
considering their profile and their
difference of screen size obviously
makes a lot of sense the galaxy note if
you use it intensely you're gonna get
about 6 hours of non-stop web browsing
wears on the iPhone you're probably
gonna get about the same but 5.3 inches
versus 4 right so it makes sense moving
down we have a removable battery on the
Galaxy Note so you're gonna battery
extender I've seen third-party batteries
as large as 5300 milla be provided I'll
be a through eBay and whatnot but the
point is is that you can add a battery
you can have a couple of batteries with
you we all know the benefits of
expandable memory and expandable or
replaceable batteries most batteries of
this nature the nickel cadmium or the
lithium ion the lithium polymer that's
in both of these they do tend to deplete
their half-life comes in and around 500
cycles so from there on in after about a
year depending on how many times you
charge it maybe less than a year you're
gonna be looking at less battery life as
time goes forward in that case you're
basically well I can't really say that
on youtube but you're gonna be having a
lot less battery life with the
but with the Galaxy Note obviously you
can buy a new battery other than that in
terms of optics we're looking at eight
megapixel cameras for both and both are
capable of about capturing stunning
images particularly in high light the
low light the low light sensor that
Apple is been able to incorporate it's
supposed to be quite good we'll have to
test that out in another comparison but
both our 8 megapixel regardless for the
front-facing camera
the Galaxy Note 2 features the leading 2
megapixel so for Skype chats and for
other things voice chat video chat
you're gonna have a much higher
resolution if the bandwidth allows on
the Galaxy Note whereas with the iPhone
5 it's only 1.2 megapixel they're cheap
data and you guys a little bit there you
know anyway moving it down we have NFC
Near Field Communication on the Galaxy
Note which isn't the most common use but
it's nice to have for future
expandability down the line a lot of
cool stuff can come there but it's
getting held up for a couple of reasons
which I'll detail another post later
either way we have NEC young Alex you
know no NFC on the iPhone 5 moving it
down to connectivity so we have LTE
capability for the internet for the u.s.
specific version of this device and for
Korean version and for international
version we have HSDPA plus both feature
Wi-Fi for the Galaxy Note and this one
comes with bluetooth 4.0 out of the box
for the iPhone 5 it is an LTE specific
and capable device and it also runs with
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0 as well Galaxy
Note is a unique product there's no
doubt about it it created a new product
category phablet you know it's catching
on there's a ton of competitors out
there we see devices getting larger and
larger but this device at the time it
was released in October last year 2011
it was a true trailblazer and some
people thought it was ridiculous I mean
not even the largest hands can touch
that top corner I mean you'd really have
to be like a UFC Superman to do it but
that's not the point for media for
browsing you know just for overall
consumption of content for creative
types people that just love him in the
most rich experience an immersive
experience possible
the Galaxy Note and the soon to come
Galaxy Note 2 really do take the cake
for that but for those seeking perhaps
more of a versatile
or mmm how would I say just easier
one-handed operation you know you can
just pound with a quick note one-handed
on this let's just do a new one
let's just open up our mail here okay
let's not open up on my own it's just
making you note so what is the best
Android phone pretty good let's do that
one-handed what is the best oops
I'll just a little bit slower okay no
bad no of course on this bad boy it's
gonna be significantly more challenging
in fact I'm not gonna bother showing you
let's do Nascimento that's where this
bad boy comes from the blaze the s-pen
right a lot of people love this thing
particularly creative types people that
love to make notes we got some 8i up in
here it's nice to have the pen if you
like to cap your notes or you have the
little bit of creative idea in there
want to take a picture let's do
something from the gallery it doesn't
really matter
point is with the s-pen you have a lot
of versatility and flexibility and
that's good the iPhone 5 doesn't have
that kind of functionality and it's
likely that iPhone never really will
that's not the point
these are two totally different products
but people still wanted to know for
comparison they reached out to us and
asked us to do it
footprint of the device is substantially
different obviously the iPhone is very
functional for one hand and the no to
not so much so moving on you know we
have Android ICS 4.04 on the Galaxy Note
right now it's gonna come with jellybean
a little bit down the line we have the
Galaxy Note 2 coming out in a couple
weeks here so obviously this product
will be faded away but for now it's
still gonna be a great deal it can be
had in some markets for as low as 350
300 secondhand which makes it quite a
steal for those who love gaming movies
web browsing it's one of the best
devices out there obviously Samsung has
their whole s-pen suite the Premium
Suite has come and there's a ton of
style of specific apps that are being
released they released the SDK for
developers so a lot of really innovative
functions that are coming for the S Pen
and have already
already so in terms of pricing we have
$1.99 $2.99 and 399 for the iPhone 5 and
the galaxy all is being faded out but
you can buy it unlock roughly for around
five hundred forty dollars sometimes
cheaper on Amazon and whatnot so the
Agostino actually saw really strong
sales like I said the Pioneer new
category sold over ten million worldwide
there's a ton of imitators out there the
s-pen was a unique feature that a lot of
people really appreciated where some
they just kind of let it stay dormant
within the iPhone 5 on the other hand is
the probably likely going to be the
best-selling device best selling mobile
smartphone device in the future they
sold 2 million in 24 hours as soon as it
was released the pre-orders just got
jammed third-party sites everyone cried
they went down here we were in Hong Kong
trying to get it and the lineups were
astounding either way we were able to
secure one for you guys because that's
what we do obviously substantially
lighter than the original iPhone 19%
lighter
excuse me 19% thinner significantly
thinner in fact on the larger screen of
4 inches
iOS 6 comes with a lot of improvements
to the architecture but there are a
couple negatives too like a redesigned
App Store that a lot of people aren't
comfortable with the map solution has
been switched away from Google and from
what I've heard and what I'm seeing so
far it is vastly inferior so that's a
bad move on Apple's part but it's a
strategic one for them to separate
themselves from Google as they are
fierce competitors obviously we know
that Android is pretty much the most
popular Android excuse-me operating
system in the world now with over 1.4
million activations daily but we have to
appreciate competition competition
between these two major ecosystems and
soon maybe Windows Phone 8 to come is a
good thing for US consumers it pushes
the envelope better specs lower prices
more features boom-boom-boom-boom-boom
we want to foster competition but as it
stands right now androids on over 67%
almost 70% globally of devices being
activated or his iPhone is just dropping
and dropping around 16 17 % right now
so build the materials how much does it
cost to make the iPhone cost 207 bucks
to make the iPhone and how much they
selling for basically three and a half
times that so they're making a lot of
money for the Galaxy Note cost about
$240 to me so a little bit more you know
and what we're looking at here is an
AMOLED display AMOLED it stands for
active matrix oxygen light-emitting
diode it's a different display
technology kind of like plasma vs. LCD
richer colors deeper blacks but less
bright whites so let's just do a quick
comparison of the browsers here we've
cleared the cache we're just going to
open up the native browser where are we
at here okay there it is and from here
so far Internet both are fluid let's
just bring up Android authorities off
column here Android
okay I'm just bring up your iPhone here
okay so three two one go
excuse me guys we didn't set up the
Wi-Fi on this my bad okay let's just do
it quick clear the cache on this bad boy
gonna Safari here clear cookies in data
okay bring up the Wi-Fi I'm just gonna
put the password in here for a sec
now we did actually do a drop test of
the iPhone 5 today and I really have to
hand it to Apple they made so many
improvements to the design of the vise
it is reka believed dropped it four
times from Heights from two feet six
inches all the way up and it would it
didn't break the screen didn't break
when we dropped it with her purses the
s3 both broke but it's completely
redesigned they have what appears to be
some kind of membrane that is encasing
the device and the nice polycarbonate
metal makes it lighter and extremely
strong it still is a glass display I bid
it to confirm and it is glass but it has
a metal back beautiful design very
ergonomic remarkably like there's no
doubt that a ton of ton of people are
gonna love it so here we go back to the
browser test here okay so we cleared the
cache on both as I said and let's just
start up again just to see how it
performs okay
okay Android Oh
thority dot-com be the best friend road
every day guys okay there we go
together okay great
well Huff to the same start while the
Galaxy Note seems to be ripping forward
okay remember the cache is clear this is
the fair test and the iPhone 5 PS we've
loaded the CSS things are coming in okay
pictures not finished galaxy notes doing
really impressively now this does have
ICS so it's pretty quick but not as
quick as jellybeans and check out our
Galaxy Nexus vs iPhone 5 to see some
really fluid browsing all right well it
looks like the iPhone 5 one that's not a
surprise guys this has an a6 processor
and the benchmarks show that this is
actually powerful so powerful in fact
that it's even more powerful than the
galaxy s3 with a quad-core 1.4 gigahertz
XE nose and this only has a dual-core
galaxy note only one point four
gigahertz dual-core so in terms of fluid
operation you have to really give it to
Apple they have something really
remarkable they're so fluid it's just so
nice to use Doctson no one is really
good too but it just doesn't touch what
we have with the iPhone but this is
capable of running flash and that's
something that phone can't do and of
course flash is being phased out but
it's nice to have choices right and
don't want update so other than that
we're just taking a look at the Galaxy
Note in the hand obviously really really
large the iPhone nice and convenient but
Rus but small so it's up to you guys
it's personal preference we just want to
offer you a versus to give you a
hands-on perspective what it's like you
can basically almost fit like two
iPhones in the galaxy novel but very
very different profile different
products different categories so this is
the first hands-on comparison of battles
brand spanking new iPhone 5 versus an
older device the galaxy note from
