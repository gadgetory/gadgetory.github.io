Android Authority and an ongoing trend
that's been happening a lot lately is
manufacturers releasing a better SPECT
version of their current flagship and
now xiaomi is taking part in that trend
with the me note and essentially putting
it on steroids
this is the Xiaomi me note pro in a
manner of speaking the me note Pro could
be looked at as the bigger brother to
the regular me note because of the
ramped up specs but physically it's
actually not any bigger in fact they're
practically identical in pretty much
every way from the display size to the
overall size and shape the Mino Pro
features the same metal and glass
construction with 2.5 D glass on the
front that gently curves along the edges
and 3d glass on the back that features
more pronounced curves along the left
and right sides all that is held
together by a metal frame with chamfered
edges but to signify that this is the
pro version of the phone the frame has
been treated with a gold finish versus
the silver finish on the regular mean
note the ring around the camera and me
logo on the back has also been treated
with the same gold colour to match the
design isn't overly flashy but it's a
very beautiful looking phone and it
feels great in the hand like most phones
that feature a glass back panel it does
tend to feel a bit slippery and is very
prone to fingerprints but the chamfered
edges along the metal frame certainly
make the phone easier to grip just like
the standard me note one-handed use
ability is surprisingly not that bad
with a 5.7 inch screen the Mino pro is
still a large phone but Xiaomi has done
an incredible job with keeping the
device thin and shrinking down the side
bezels so it's not quite as difficult to
use in one hand as you might initially
think although there still is a little
bit of shuffling required to reach every
corner of the display to help make the
phone more manageable the power and
volume keys are located on the right
side where they can easily be reached
with your thumb the power and volume
keys are also made of metal and they're
very tactile and easy to press so they
feel every bit as good as the rest of
the phone
the remaining ports are in pretty
typical locations with a 3.5 millimeter
headset jack up top microUSB port and a
single speaker at the bottom
and these sim card slot is on the left
side on the front our capacitive keys
below the display and a multicolored LED
notification light is up top next to the
front-facing camera earpiece and other
typical sensors as mentioned earlier the
display still measures in at 5.7 inches
which makes it great for consuming all
sorts of media and playing games but the
resolution has been bumped up to quad HD
or 2560 by 1440 giving off a whopping
515 PPI the screen is extremely sharp
you're not going to be able to notice
any pixels on top of that colors are
very rich and vibrant the screen
exhibits a great amount of contrast with
some very deep blacks for an LCD and
viewing angles are really good Xiaomi
also includes some color calibration
settings built into the software to
tweak the display more to your liking
but the default out of the box settings
are already good as is so I never felt a
need to make any changes there's even a
reading mode that makes the screen much
easier on the eyes so you're not
straining your eyes when looking at the
screen for long periods of time the
screen also does a great job of the
tracking glare and it's very easy to see
in broad daylight and a lot of that can
be contributed to what Xiaomi calls a
sunlight display which actually makes
adjustments at the hardware level to
each individual pixel for better
real-time contrast and outdoor
readability versus just ramping up the
display brightness to compensate like
most typical displays tend to do
internally the Mino Pro is packing the
latest Snapdragon 810 processor which
has received quite a bit of flack since
its inception but regardless it's still
one of the most powerful chipsets
currently available the Mino Pro is also
one of the few phones on the market to
be packin 4 gigabytes of RAM that's
lpddr4 ram by the way which is almost 2
times faster than the older ddr3 RAM and
much more power efficient phones are
getting so fast nowadays that it's
really hard to notice much of a
difference from one phone to the next
but the Amino pro can more than hold its
own against the best of the competition
in day-to-day usage the Mino pro is
extremely fluid and responsive despite
the fact that our review unit is still
running beta software everything from
navigating through the general UI
applications and playing games has been
a very pleasurable experience and of
course with 4 gigabytes of ddr4 ram
multitasking between light and heavier
applications like games doesn't faze the
me note Pro one bit the only thing I
noticed was when playing games or
watching videos the me note Pro does
tend to run a little bit warm and you
can definitely feel the heat dissipating
through the metal frame and the back
glass but I wouldn't say it ever gets to
the point where it feels uncomfortable
or it's completely unusable so it is
something to be aware of I wouldn't
necessarily say it's a huge concern
other Hardware on me know Pro includes
64 gigabytes of internal storage and
this is actually the only configuration
that will be available for most people
this would be more than enough storage
but if you're looking to expand via
microSD you don't have that option here
as with any other modern-day smartphone
LTE connectivity is available but since
this phone is not designed for the US
market or any market outside of China
really I was limited to HSPA+ on
t-mobile's network but it was still
plenty fast for pretty much anything
that I wanted to do speaker quality from
the bottom mounted speaker is also quite
good as it gets plenty loud for a single
driver without sounding distorted but as
with any other bottom firing speaker it
can be very easy to muffle when holding
the device in landscape and the sideways
firing audio creates for a lopsided
listening experience the me note pro
retains the same 13 megapixel optically
stabilized rear camera as the standard
me note which isn't a bad thing by any
means and Xiaomi is quite proud of the
fact that they were able to keep the
camera flush to the body
despite the built-in OAS and the phone
being less than seven millimeters thin
the camera software is pretty simple
swiping down or to the left will reveal
a bunch of filters they can play around
with to your heart's content and swiping
the opposite direction is where you'll
find your standard shooting modes like
manual and panorama
along with a few others like beautify
and refocus for refocusing your shot
after the fact you can tap on the
viewfinder to change the point of focus
just like any other smartphone but being
able to adjust the exposure at the same
time through the on-screen exposure dial
is definitely one of the most intuitive
aspects of Xiaomi's camera UI the camera
software also allows
for adjustments to be made to the
exposure settings contrast saturation
and sharpness for more granular controls
over the image quality speaking of image
quality is just as good as it was on the
mean note which is really no surprise
considering it's the same sensor and
camera software the shutter speed is
nice and quick so it's really easy to
get a photo with tact sharp focus and
the resulting images are vibrant rich in
color with a great amount of contrast
and dynamic range in both indoor and
outdoor situations the camera is also
capable of taking some rather impressive
macro shots with a very clear subject to
focus in the foreground and a nice and
clean bokeh effect in the background
Auto HDR is also available on this
camera to help take out the guesswork on
when to use HDR and the HDR processing
itself does a great job of bringing out
some extra details in the shadows while
adding a nice level of boost in
saturation without appearing unnatural
where this camera struggles the most is
in low-light and nighttime photography
the increase in digital noise is to be
expected but there's just a lot of noise
reduction going on that results in some
softer details and highlights tend to
get blown out like street lights and
lampposts for example the camera also
tends to hunt for focus more often than
I'd like and many of the images will
have some noticeable artifacting overall
though this is really not a bad camera
to have in your pocket with the front
camera Xiaomi chose to not go with a
higher megapixel count and instead took
HTC's approach by going with a lower
resolution four megapixel sensor with a
larger pixel size of two microns this
allows for more light to enter the
camera and better quality images so if
selfies are your thing then the front
camera is not going to disappoint 4k
video recording is also possible with
the amino Pro and the OAS does a great
job of keeping the footage stable when
you're walking or moving around and the
continuous autofocus is very quick to
focus when moving between close and
faraway subjects and menu control over
focusing is also available just by
tapping on the viewfinder another aspect
of the me note that transitioned over to
the Mino pro is the battery capacity so
it's the same 3000 milliamp hour
battery but with the increase in specs
like the quad HD display the Snapdragon
810 and the four gigabytes of RAM
without an increase in the battery to
compensate for those specs battery life
leaves a lot to be desired and you can
get through a full day if you stay away
from heavy things like gaming or
watching a lot of videos but if you like
to watch a lot of videos or play a lot
of games on your phone like I do you'll
find yourself connected to a charger
pretty frequently midway through the day
now keep in mind that this phone isn't
optimized for networks outside of China
so that may have some impact on the
battery life but on the bright side the
phone does support quick charge 2.0
which will allow you to get up to 70%
charge in just one hour without digging
into the software details it might be
hard to tell at first glance that the
mean note Pro is running Android 5.0
lollipop and a lot of that has to do
with Xiaomi me UI interface me UI
doesn't adopt much of the material
design aesthetics from lollipop if any
to be honest and it's a lot like the
interfaces you get from other Chinese
OEMs with colorful squared icons and the
lack of an app drawer and this
particular software built on the Amino
pro there's actually very little
pre-installed bloatware to be had which
was great to see and even though me UI
changes much of Google's vision of
Android it adds more to the experience
than it takes away for first-time me y
users this will be a very different
experience but shall be skin isn't
overbearing in any way and brings about
a handful of useful features
HiFi a do is still available in the
settings for better quality audio when
listening to headphones and a one-handed
mode that lets you shrink the screen
from anywhere between 3.5 to 4.5 inches
just by swiping outwards on the home
button in either direction me UI also
offers one of the most robust steam
engines available on any Android skin
there's hundreds of various different
themes to choose from so you're bound to
find at least a few that suits your
taste and these themes alter pretty much
every part of the OS from the system UI
lock screen icons wallpapers and even
the default applications like the dialer
and messaging apps as great of a phone
as the me Note pro maybe the unfortunate
part is its price and availability the
phone is currently only available in
China
$29.99 RMB which is roughly 480 US
dollars but if you're in the US or any
other part of the world you'll most
likely be looking at a hefty premium to
import the device and without a wider
range of LTE support other flagship
devices like the g4 and s6 will be a
more viable option that can offer a more
than comparable experience xiaomi says
that the me note pro is the best
smartphone in the world to date and
while that statement can certainly be
subjective the extremely impressive
hardware both inside and out and great
user experience makes it tough to argue
otherwise it's just a shame that more
people won't be able to get their hands
on it
