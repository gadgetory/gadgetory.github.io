weekly my name is Jason this is where we
cover the week's Android news now you
might think that the Christmas week was
a slow news week when it comes to
android but on the contrary we found
some interesting leaks regarding the
galaxy notepro BAM LG wearables oh yeah
and trolls no not that type of trolling
I'm talking patent trolls and because
when it comes to patent trolls users or
the only losers I'm a little hot under
the collar so today is all gonna be
about a bully beatdown oh sorry sorry
alright let's go back to the basics you
all know but a company called Google but
do you know but a company called rock
star not that type of company rock star
isn't even a real company so much as a
consortium of companies led by Apple
Microsoft and blackberry to name a few
and what they've done is bought a host
of patents by a now defunct company
called nortel and Rockstar hires a team
of engineers to take those patents and
search for other successful tech
products by other successful companies
to see if possibly their patents are
being infringed upon now their patents
don't really need to be infringed upon
but if there's a possible open
interpretation that they might they can
then sue those companies for you know
patent infringement ah but it gets worse
you see rockstar doesn't make any
products with these patents they don't
work the patents as was originally
intended when patent law was formed what
they do do is use it as a form of
corporate bullying and it's nasty let me
just give you a short example from these
court documents one of their titles of
these patents that they're suing for is
called a navigational tool for graphical
user interface so how many devices do
you use every day that has some sort of
navigational tool for graphical user
interface a lot a lot now I'm not going
into the detail of the actual patent
itself but it just gives you an example
of the open general you know patents
that are being given out I mean you
could argue this camera I'm shooting on
has a tool for national you know
graphical user interface are they
infringing on rockstars patents I mean
it's crazy it's crazy and they use this
as an offensive corporate tool so for
example last year or two years ago Apple
countersued Samsung to try and stop them
from selling that the galaxy s4 in the
u.s. is just it's crazy it is totally
opposing the whole original purpose for
patent law was that you know if you
could create something innovative that
people truly wanted you should be
granted on my knob
for a few short years so you can reap
the benefits of your great idea of your
innovation but then I could make a
competitor's product based on your
innovation I just have to pay you a
license for it so you win I win and the
consumer wins right now no one wins
except for the lawyers who charge
millions of dollars to fight these
fruitless legal battles so you remember
how last week I spent time cautioning
you about the importance of backing up
your irreplaceable files yeah so you'd
think I'd know better by now but I get
distracted because I like to blow stuff
up or more specifically just pone my
teenage boys all right writing next
week's show looks done looks good dad
it's your time to get pwned on cod yeah
she did it now but then i remembered
that before i went to play i forgot to
backup my hours of hard work and i lost
it dad wake up dad see if you have a way
to back up your most important data
online automatically you won't have to
suffer the way I did it's okay yes it
wasn't pretty but whether you have
multiple computers at home or at work
Carbonite has an affordable plan for you
to do just that automatically backup
your most important data online so you
don't have to now I can hook you up with
a free trial no credit card required if
you go to carbonite.com with the offer
code android you get two bonus months if
you decide to buy moving on to some
happier news with the Samsung Galaxy
Note pro but warning this is just a
rumor nothing has yet been officially
announced we have learned of a 12.2 inch
Galaxy Note pro android tablet
reportedly being demoed in South Korea
just a few days ago with the device
expected to be unveiled as early as next
month at CES 2014 as far as specs and
features the tablet is said to have a
2560 x 1600 resolution LC display 2.4
gigahertz earth 3 gigabytes of ram and a
whopping 9500 milliamp hour battery and
of course running android 4.4 kitkat now
these rumors turned out to be true that
would mean that this tablet would have
the biggest battery out of
any of the Samsung tablets thus far so
why should any of us really care about a
12 point 2 inch tablet well for many
years now people have been throwing
around that term post-pc era that hasn't
fully transpired really i mean the vast
majority of you are probably still
watching this on a laptop or desktop
right now so I believe this is Samsung's
attempt to begin to close that gap
especially if they can couple this
heavy-duty tablet hardware with office
like software pro software like
something that can be used for office
and power users so you and I can begin
to think about finally doing away with
our laptop once and for all now on to LG
wearable devices now numerous reports
have come out that LG is not just
working on a new LG g3 but two new
wearable devices the first one is called
G arch which is some sort of SmartWatch
device and the second is called G health
which is some sort of fitness tracker
will be looking forward to more news in
the coming year thanks for watching
