brought to you by full sail university
welcome back to android weekly my name
is jason this is where we cover the
week's Android news like how a young man
somehow got his hands on the new HTC One
we have a video to prove it and galaxy
s4 users will be very happy to know
they're getting KitKat Google's
text-to-speech upgrade means that the
voice will sound smoother and more
natural good for me because if I have to
continue to suffer google mouse
harassment at least she'll sound more
human while doing it geez they want your
autograph I doubt that they think your
grew yeah so the Android world was a
flutter this past week with the release
of a leaked video showing the supposed
HTC m8 or rather the new HTC One it was
shot by a young man who somehow got his
hands on this flagship device before its
launch and although he seems like an
excited young man with a new toy he
clearly did not understand the legal
implications of the leak Jeff Gordon and
HTC executives sent the young man an
ominous tweet saying it's not gonna be a
good week for you my friend but if the
leaked video is real it shows that HTC
has made some changes to their flagship
device it appears from the video that
HTC made several changes to the camera
app and the cameras quality he received
a high rating 8.7 from our young
reviewer beats audio and the popular
dual speaker setup remain on the HTC One
2014 and it also appears that there is
an SD card slot although this could just
be a feature included in the prototype
moving on to news about paranoid android
4.0 the team behind paranoid android
recently announced that it was killing
the halo multitasking system but it
turns out the team had larger plans for
phandroid android almost everything in
the rom is being redesigned to fit the
team's vision of what makes a great rom
based on stock android one of those
added features is pi and it will be
updated to fit the same aesthetic as the
Google now launcher that means it will
have easier access to Google now with a
swipe to the left most home screen now
the ultimate goal of version four point
oh is to attract more people to the ROM
and not just the same law who are
comfortable with command line operations
so one of the questions that comes up
very frequently is
hey Jase I want to learn how to code on
Android well that is good good good
because there is certainly a shortage of
skilled software developers out there
the concern is is that if you try and
teach yourself which some people do with
success but it is the most frustrating
painful route and those who do succeed
often have their first app looking
something like this that's why I was
genuinely excited to have full sail
university join us because they help
deal with this very challenged in this
degree you'll learn both the programming
and business side of mobile development
so that you can develop and market an
application from start to finish you'll
explore advanced programming languages
visual frameworks usability principles
and app deployment for both iOS and
Android students also receive a macbook
pro with all the industry tools don't
move now if you're serious about
competing in this rapidly growing
industry and not just talk about it
visit Full Sail edu /a authority to
learn more about this online degree
program now moving on to the bodacious
claim that the Oppo find 7 will have a
rumored 50 megapixel camera 50 perfect
for those of us android users who want
to point our camera to the sky to help
find water on Mars according to a post
on Weibo the OPA find seven will have a
50 megapixel camera apparently oppa has
already posted a sample photo to prove
it with a massive crop factor the Oppo
find 7 is scheduled for an official
announcement on March 19th so we are
right on track for leaks and teasers
Oppo has already teased a 5.5 inch 2600
x 1440 display and leaks have suggested
it will have 3 gigabytes of ram and a
snapdragon 800 processor not a bad phone
at all now what was believed that there
would only be a 13 megapixel camera but
now we believe where we wonder if opal
has seriously stepped up the specs to
outdo any of the competition thanks for
watching a droid army my name is Jason
you should know that we have been
sending out those t-shirts to our
Android QA winners thanks to Kyle here
for sharing his photo with us looking
good Kyle the rest of you please share
your photos with us I will only share
them publicly it with your permission of
course but my question for the rest
is surrounding the whole new HTC One
what do you guys think of that phone I
mean it looks fantastic if the specs are
accurate I think it's possibly a great
phone I'm really looking forward to how
HTC Sense six works on the phone the
build quality looks fantastic I'm a
little torn because I am looking to buy
a new phone in the next few weeks what
should I get you know toss between the
nexus 5 the Moto X and now maybe the HTC
One but it's five inches and I would
prefer something a little smaller let me
know in the comments below what you
think I should see you next week on
Android Q&amp;amp;A</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
