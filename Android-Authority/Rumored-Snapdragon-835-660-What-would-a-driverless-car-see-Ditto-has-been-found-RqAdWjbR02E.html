would a driverless car see the world
around it well we know how a Tesla sees
the world being human we can't exactly
understand how a car sees anything but
we do have visualizations that try to
emulate the complex computations the car
is making but how does the vehicle
actually decide what objects to avoid
and how does it stand track over long
stretches of the road Tesla has just
released a new demo video showing us
just that in the video here a
self-driving Tesla cruises through
various environments spotting objects
along the roadside and registering them
into different categories the various
cameras on the vehicle are rigged up to
show the object that it is tracking in
real time and it's actually quite
incredible how accurately attracts
things in real time from cars to people
to Road lines the vehicle sets different
colored boxes around these objects to
know what to watch out for
very cool love that stuff and if you
want to learn more you should go to our
sister site charged dot IO now let's
talk snapdragons specifically the
alleged 835 and 660 because we have
rumoured specs that have leaked an image
obtained by Chinese tech site and jcn
might have revealed the specs for
Qualcomm's next generation mobile
processor the Snapdragon 835 Qualcomm
announced the Snapdragon 835 previously
thought to be called the Snapdragon 830
last week but didn't delve into details
concerning its hardware now the finer
details may be out in the open the image
which also refers to a Snapdragon 660
was reposted by gizmo China and suggests
that the Snapdragon 835 will be based on
a revised cryo 200 CPU architecture
featuring an octa-core design with four
large and four small course clock speeds
are currently unknown and an adrenal 540
GPU and the company's x16 LTE modem for
comparison this year's flagship 14
nanometer Snapdragon 820 features a
quad-core
Kairo CPU and Adreno 530 GPU and X
12 LTE modem okay so about a week and a
half ago I caused a better an uproar in
the comments because I suggested that
not many of you were playing Pokemon go
anymore
well apparently lots of you were playing
I hear you loud and clear you also said
that I was click baiting because I
suggested in the title that I didn't
suggest in the title but you believed
that I suggested in the title that I was
click baiting by saying that I was going
to tell you how and where you could find
ditto in Pokemon go well I didn't
suggest that in a title the article just
talked about how that ditto may actually
be in the game and you can still find it
this from the game's CEO but now we know
that ditto has been found been seen and
captured and we know a little more at
long last the elusive ditto has appeared
in Pokemon go the only non legendary
Pokemon of the original 151 that hadn't
yet made an appearance can now be
captured and for those of you familiar
with Pokemon may have anticipated
ditto hides in plain sight did it was
known for taking on the form of other
Pokemon and thus you won't see it in its
natural form in the wild instead you may
find that after catching a Pokemon
reportedly common Pokemon lycra Tadas a
cutscene will play to reveal that you in
fact have caught ditto
reports also suggest that ditto can
still be caught using lures and incense
as well as other Pokemon mmm so dear
there you go
let me know in the comments below if you
have caught ditto actually don't don't I
really don't care about Pokemon go
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
