the galaxy s7 this year something that
people really missed last year with the
galaxy s6 that's why the galaxy s6
active appealed so much to people it
even came with a beefier battery too
with Samsung's next smartphone in its
active line how can I differentiate
itself enough given that water
resistance is back already with the s7
don't worry there's more than meets the
eye with this one hey guys John be here
with Android Authority and this is our
hands-on look at the Samsung Galaxy s7
active alright so the most
distinguishable difference here is that
it's more rugged nature that shouldn't
surprise anyone it's not premium by the
imagination
see that it's mostly dominated by the
same textured rear pattern that we've
seen before
accompanied by those soft touch matte
bumpers around the sides of the phone to
absorb shock it doesn't have the same
fragile nosov the galaxy s7 now the best
part about this one is that it's able to
withstand most drops
and boy can endure them like no other in
addition to that it's constructed so
that's protected from extreme
temperatures dust low pressure high
altitude and yes full submersion
underwater it's actually a little bit
better than the s7 you can submerge it
deeper underwater up to five feet for 30
minutes while it's not the prettiest
thing you can understand the reasoning
behind its particular design much like
the other previous phones in the line
yes it's technically bulkier and heavier
making it a bit tougher to manipulate
with one hand but all this is necessary
in giving that indestructible nature the
same display in the s7 is present here
with the s7 active so that's a 5.1 inch
1445 2560 Super AMOLED panel it's
detailed sharp produces some very
iridescent colors and offers exceptional
wide angles everything about it seems to
be on the same levels the galaxy s7
including the new always-on display
feature what differ though is that the
s7 active has a shatter resistant screen
it holds up over other screens but we're
happy to notice that it's visibility and
clarity isn't subdued or greatly
impacted given that Samsung's AMOLED
screens have shown their superiority in
terms of color accuracy and brightness
potency the resistance aspect of the
split is icing on the cake one of the
notable additions to the phone is the
fingerprint sensor which is a first for
the active line it's flight between two
other rather large sized physical
buttons the back and quick menu keys
there's also a mammoth 4,000 milliamp
hour battery that's stuffed inside
that's one of the largest if not the
largest capacities they've been able to
cram into its smartphones so that should
help in giving it more longevity than
the s7 additionally you'll find Wireless
and rapid charging as well the phone is
powered by a quad-core 2.1 5 gigahertz
Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chipset coupled
with 4 gigabytes of RAM
and the Adreno 530 GPU it feels not
being fast and given that it's almost
unchanged from the galaxy s7 the SM
inactive should perform nicely when it
comes to graphics processing storage
amounts to 32 gigabytes with our
particular unit but it can be
supplemented with the available microSD
card slot the s7 active borrows the s7 s
camera so that's the same 12 megapixel
sensor with an F 1.7 aperture lens
you also have phase detection autofocus
o is and an LED flash the only other
thing worth mentioning here is how there
are few manual controls available with
video recording when you use the pro
mode which is something we haven't seen
before in a galaxy smartphone so let me
interpret adjust parameters like the
shutter speed white balance and focus
all on the fly frankly speaking there's
not a whole lot different with a
TouchWiz experience here with the s7
active which is running top of android
6.0.1 marshmallow the usual visuals are
all there so there's nothing really out
of the ordinary
it's great for power users just because
you have features like true multitasking
with multi window you have the one
handed mode for easier on handling and
all the other sorted smart gestures with
the experience we've talked about some
the s7 actives benefits but it all comes
down to price it will have to fork over
a good $100 more to pick it up over the
standard s7 through 18t so that's almost
$800 for the s7 active versus only $700
for the s7 naturally there are reasons
why it's priced higher like you
mentioned ready sure the look of the
phone won't appeal to everyone but if
utility is on your list the galaxy s7
active will fit the bill so that's about
it with the Samsung Galaxy s7 active if
