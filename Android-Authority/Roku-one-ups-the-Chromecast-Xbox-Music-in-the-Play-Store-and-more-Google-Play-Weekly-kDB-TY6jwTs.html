handy the Android authority app guy and
welcome to Google Play weekly episode 5
we have a lot to talk about this week
Xbox music gets released
Foursquare lets you look at menus and
Roku says up yours to the chromecast
without further ado let's get started
the first thing we'll talk about this
week is Google Play Music Google Play
Music is already a premium music
streaming service that lets you upload
twenty thousand of your own songs and if
you pay for it play any song in the
Google Play Store with this latest
update you can now listen to radio
stations based on music genre it is a
fairly easy feature to access once you
pay for Google Music you simply go into
the app go under radio and then select
the genre tab you have roughly two dozen
genres to choose from including rock pop
and classical it even includes my
favorite genre which is ska music inside
each genre are a set of sub genres which
only increases your options
Foursquare received a sizeable update
this week and it actually adds to the
functionality the social media network
is already based on location but now you
have another way to interact with that
location you can now view over 43
million menus from 500,000 restaurants
it's been seamlessly integrated into
Foursquare seemingly ever-changing
interface when you view a location that
has a menu the menu option will appear
using it you can browse items and see if
any of them sound good to you this is
not only good for places you're at but a
good way to see if there's anything good
on the menu where you're going a new
scare story has been circulating around
the internet the last few days it was
started by Symantec makers of the
popular Norton AntiVirus Symantec stated
that in the month of August over 1,000
fraudulent applications were submitted
to the Google Play Store
according to reports Symantec says these
apps were downloaded about 8,500 times
but could have been as high as 10,000
before you lose your shorts and download
another three anti-virus apps keep in
mind that as long as you pay attention
to what's going on and downloaded from
trusted app developers this will
probably never happen to you
Microsoft is showing signs that they are
finally seeing the light because they
have released their first fully
functioning application to the Google
Play Store
it is Xbox music and it does compete
favorably on many levels with many
competitors it has a decent number of
songs at a decent price point and it's
definitely worth checking into
it's
early release so they haven't made it
compatible with every device just yet
for instance I couldn't get it on my HTC
one if you do pick it up you'll have 30
days to try it out for free but then you
have to pay $9.99 a month or $99.90 a
year for service if you're in the market
for a new streaming service a 30 day
trial is more than enough of a reason to
try it out
since the chromecast came out life has
been a little difficult for set-top
boxes the chromecast doesn't have all
the functionality of a set-top box but
it does have most of the functionality
needed to replace it entirely
Roku has come out with an update that
adds a feature and it's the only feature
that the chromecast doesn't have with
the update you can now stream local
content directly from your Android
device for many who keep up with such
development you cannot do that on a
chromecast for now it's compatible with
pretty much all Roku devices but only a
handful of Android devices including the
galaxy s3 and s4 the Nexus 7 2012 model
the HTC One and the Nexus 4 is who wants
to see some trending apps this week as
usual if you want to check any of these
apps out the links are in the video
description first up is a fun little
time waster called stickman downhill in
this game you use tilts braking and
acceleration to propel your way over
obstacles and through levels it's simple
easy and quick to play and has google
game support for leaderboards and
achievements also it's free really
there's no reason not to try this one
out if you're looking for something that
has some functionality our only app this
week with that is touch your pro it
comes from the same people who brought
you go launcher what this app does is
use a floating point that you can tap
you then have access to some favorite
apps whether toggles and a variety of
other settings it's a great way to
reduce home screen clutter without
losing functionality our second time
waster game on the list this week is
impossible lines this simple and
challenging game makes you move a green
dot to the finish without running into
any of the lines on the screen the
difficulty increases as the levels get
more difficult because when you start
moving the obstacles disappear and you
must use your memory to find your way
through simple Rockets is definitely our
favorite trending game this week the
premise of the game is pretty simple you
build rockets and then fly them around
to obtain certain challenges or you can
make them fly turn them around and make
them blow up it allows people to be
creative which is nice and it's
genuinely fun to play last up this week
is another game called toast time in
this little 8-bit game you are a toaster
that shoots
toasted bad guys to defend a clock you
can bounce around by shooting toast at
the ground and get upgraded toast by
shooting crates it's more fun than you
should reasonably be able to have with
toasts
