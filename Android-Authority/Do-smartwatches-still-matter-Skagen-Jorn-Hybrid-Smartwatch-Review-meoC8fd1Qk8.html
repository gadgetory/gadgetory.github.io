celebrating my birthday I decided to
treat myself I went over to a retailer
that happened to have a hybrid
SmartWatch that I had my eyes on and I
tried it on a couple of days later I was
compelled to actually buy it so the
question remains why would I move away
from the different full smartwatches
like we have in Android wear or Tizen or
of course with the pebble which I've
worn for a long time now to an analogue
watch that basically has a few neat
tricks well it's time to find out
because it's Joshua Carl what's going on
everybody and this is my review of the
Scoggin yarn hybrid SmartWatch now in
reviewing this particular watch I also
want to ponder the question do
smartwatches still matter and the reason
why I want to ponder this is because
with this watch I realized that a lot of
what smartwatches bring to the table I
actually don't really need in my daily
life anymore outfitted with the slim yet
sleek body the Smart Watch comes with a
light leather band that gives it a nice
mixture of style it's casual enough to
wear within normal clothing but just
fancy enough to fit right in with a
button-down or even a suit part of the
reason for that kind of style is the
fact that the hybrid SmartWatch has an
analogue face that is simple and doesn't
overwhelm with too much information and
of course it doesn't have a touchscreen
which kind of leads me to my first
thought about smartwatches I think we
went a little bit too far too fast
remember when Android wear was
originally announced we had the LG G
watch and the Samsung gear live now the
Samsung gear live tried to inject a
little bit of style but the LG G watch I
think was a great precursor to what
smartwatches have become now basically a
whole different screen this time just on
your wrist unfortunately with it came
all of the possibilities and all of the
pitfalls the fact remains that
smartwatches take up the same amount of
attention that you would otherwise
dedicate to your phone unfortunately
that gave people the ability to read
whole messages or notifications swiping
or dialing them up little by little
that's literally an amount of time that
you would have spent on your phone and
arguably it would have been easier to
read it not on your wrist so the Scoggin
yarn sells the time and then a few other
pieces of information when pressing one
of the three buttons on the side yeah
this is a little bit like the pebble
that I used to love then had to
unfortunately set aside now but there
are going to be programmable functions
for each button the list is a bit
extensive music and volume control
our shutter button via bluetooth telling
the date showing a secondary time zone
and showing step counts on the top left
of the watch is an area that shows 0 to
100 which is the percentage of 1 step
goals this is also programmable in the
Scoggin connected app and when the
button is pressed both watch arms come
together to 0 and then move to what your
actual percentage is as for the actual
fitness tracking the urine is a little
bit too liberal with its counts but
overall it gets the job done
this movement of the arms is undeniably
cool and it hasn't gotten old yet and it
makes you remember what smartwatches
were kind of supposed to be at first
remember all the spy watches for movies
like James Bond they were all really
good looking timepieces that had hidden
features now compare that to something
that is all screen all the time and
obviously is run on a bunch of
applications those make those features
less hidden and of course a little bit
less cooler notifications are supposed
to be the crux of the SmartWatch
experience but unfortunately that is
where the Scoggin yarn falls short much
like with other hybrid smartwatches
notifications are programmed to a
specific portion of the watch and in
this case it is 4 different colors on
the left side you program the
notifications in the connected app and
then when the notifications come through
a vibration will tell you that it is
coming and then the arms point at the
specific color based upon what you
programmed it takes a little bit of
memory but overall it's not that hard to
get used to my main problem with this
notification method especially with this
watch is that the vibration is just too
weak because these bodies have to be a
little bit smaller to fit note the
analogue style the vibration motors end
up smaller as well and thus weaker that
means that notifications and alarm
functions which aren't even included
with the Scogin yarn are simply useless
to me but with that in mind and after a
few days with the yarn I realized I
don't miss having notifications going
off on my wrist all the time we're
always inundated with a lot of
information in our connected world and
I'm usually in front of a computer or
looking at my phone fairly often to
begin with so it's not like I'll miss
out on an email or a message for very
long and unlike my pebble or any Android
wear watch I'm not being nudged to look
at my wrist practically every five
minutes and battery life forget about it
really you basically can because the
yarn and other hybrid smartwatches use
coin batteries that can last for months
on
compare that to my pebble that worked
for up to a week and pretty much any
other SmartWatch that can go for no more
than a couple of days without dying or
needing a charge now obviously with a
hybrid SmartWatch you won't be able to
change the watch face and you lose all
of the different applications in the
wear store but again I realize that
every day I don't need those kinds of
features in my life especially on my
wrist and also the watch looks good
enough that I don't mind keeping the
same watch face if it means that I can
get really good battery life so do
smartwatches still matter that's
entirely up to you so I want to know
what you think in the comments below I
am but one example of the kind of path
you can take when converting from a full
SmartWatch there are plenty of other
ways to go Finnish trackers or maybe you
just want to go straight back to analog
but I think it's important to know why
you would want to make the jump for me I
didn't know how I really felt about the
different facets of a SmartWatch until I
no longer had them in my daily life give
it a try for yourself and you might find
yourself pleasantly surprised and so
there you have it the Scoggin Yorn
hybrid SmartWatch we're not really
giving a score to this SmartWatch
because it is kind of in a fringe
category but I wanted to use it as a way
to pose the question to you do you guys
think that smartwatches as we know them
today still matter well you can talk
about Android wear smartwatches Tizen
watches even the pebble if you're still
rocking it and you can let us know what
you wear in the comments below and if
you don't wear any smartwatches or if
you actually we're a hybrid SmartWatch
let us know also in the comments below
and tell us why keep it tuned to android
authority for even more videos like this
and also for more about smartwatches
maybe a couple of hybrids in the future
but definitely more about Android wear
2.0 and beyond and you can keep it tuned
here for all of the great releases
coming this year because we are your
source for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
