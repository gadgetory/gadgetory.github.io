Android authority now we're waiting for
the new Galaxy phones to be announced
the s9 very very soon and of course in
previous years the phones have had two
types of processes in them some of them
had Qualcomm Snapdragon processors in
and some had processes from Samsung the
excellence range and true to form
Samsung have just announced a new
processor the Exynos 9 8 10 I keep
wanting to say it's not 8 9 10 but it's
t9 810 and so in today's video we're
gonna look at what is the Exynos 9 8 10
so if you want to know please let me
explain
so the first thing to note is the new X
not 9 8 10 is in direct competition with
the Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 now it is a
octa-core processor it's a 64-bit
octa-core processor and the 4 power
efficiency cores are the based on the
cortex a 55 design and that's exactly
the same as the Snapdragon 805 but when
it comes to the for high-performance
cause we have here some significant
differences Qualcomm have gone with the
cryo which is based on the cortex a 75
where a Samsung are now at their third
generation or custom CPU design so the
previous external chips had the m1 and
then the m2 and now we're at the m3 now
this key thing about the m3 first of all
is its clocked 2.9 gigahertz as its
maximum clock frequency but more
astoundingly samsung are claiming it has
double the single thread performance
than the m2 now that's quite an amazing
statement by Samsung and we really are
looking forward to seeing this chip in
some devices so we can check that out
but if it's true it means that the
Exynos 9 8 10 has got performance
parameters similar to close - not yet
beating but very similar to very close
to the Apple a11 Bionic now according to
my calculations if what Samsung is
saying is true we should be seeing
Geekbench scores for single threaded
operations of around three thousand nine
Android and multi-core scores are up
over 9000 as I say those are a huge leap
compared to what we had in the last
generation and moving on from the CPU we
go to the GPU and this has got the
latest are Mali Jeep unit that's the G
72 now the previous external chip had a
20 core GP unit this one has now got an
18 chord G unit but yet it actually has
a 20% greater performance than the
previous generation and that's because
the G 72 is a greater performing
processor than the G 71 a graphics
processor and they've gone from 24 down
to 18 but still managed to bump up that
GPU performance so again that will be
really interesting to see when we have
this in real chips other things to
notice are that it's built using a 10
nanometer fabrication process and it
also uses low-power ddr4 Ram now when it
comes to multimedia the new excel chip
can do 4k and 120 frames per second both
recording and playback and also it
supports h.265 h.264 and the vp9 codecs
now when it's using h.265 it can also
record using 10-bit color which of
course is very important for HDR setups
couple of other things to mention it can
support dual cameras on the back up to
16 megapixels or a 24 megapixel single
camera on the back it also supports
things like blue 2 5
it's got advanced image stabilization
built into the chip itself and of course
it's got the latest and greatest LTE
modem which is a 1.2 gigabits per second
LTE modem if of course your carrier
support such a thing so how does it
compared to the snapdragon 845 well for
example it's got greater features like
it's got the 120 frames per second
recording in 4k now the Qualcomm does
not have that
now last year Samsung disabled that
feature in the Exynos variant of their
phones so there was parity across all of
its devices now that will might probably
happen again this year because the
Qualcomm doesn't support 120 frames
in 4k but the bigger problem for Samsung
is this performance if the performance
is as great as they are claiming then
there's going to be quite a performance
difference between the cold conversion
of the handset and the excellence
versions of the handsets now Samsung
I've got two ways to play this one is
just to say well that's it that's the
variant you get in your region because
of modems because of you know the
regulations because of marketing that's
the variation you get and that's the
speed you have to deal with or they
could peg down the performance of the
Exynos version so that it's not so much
greater than the Snapdragon 805 version
we'll have to wait and see what Samsung
do so I'm really looking forward to
seeing this chip in devices and
comparing it to devices that got this
Snapdragon 845 it's certainly going to
be an exciting year in terms of process
of performance and processor
capabilities during this year and the
handsets that we're going to see I'm
going to sim from Andhra thority and I
