authority what's going on everybody and
you guys asked for it so here we are
delivering this is your drop test on the
Sony Xperia z2 now I'm just going to go
ahead and get right into the drop test
I'm actually really fond of this phone
it's going to hurt me a lot to do this
drop test I use this quite a bit and it
was my daily driver for a little while
so having to drop it well I think it
makes me a little bit sad but you know
how it goes already we're going to be
dropping this phone onto its back onto
its side on its face and before I got
into it I wanted to show you the actual
phone itself this is a perfectly working
phone I have taken pretty good care of
it since I first got it turning on the
screen you'll see that it comes on right
there I'll chomp the brightness so it
looks a little bit better for you and
essentially we're just going to just
drop this phone and here we go this is
the first test on the Sony Xperia z2
dropping it on to its back so here we go
you
so there you go aside from the flaps
coming off we really don't have much
structural damage to the phone at all if
any I really don't see anything here
there is one scuff right here from where
it bounced one another one over here and
a little bit of a feel down here just a
small scratch but really nothing that
you can actually truly tell is actually
there
much like the Sony Xperia z1 from last
season it looks like this one is going
to hold up pretty well and it looks like
it's still fully operational thus far
alright so here comes the next test
we're gonna be driving it right on to
its bottom right here and now the 4k
recording on the phone is actually
turned on this time because I forgot to
do it last time so here we go
all right well again structurally it
looks like things still look pretty good
you'll see a little bit of a scuff right
here on the bottom right where it landed
and it did bounce around a little bit so
you got a little scuff over here on the
side and it looks like everything still
looks pretty nice but there's one thing
that did happen and it happened to the
screen let me I have the camera on right
now so I can really illustrate for you
and it's down here on the bottom as you
can see already we have some dead pixels
right there so it looks like yeah no
matter what I do it's there oh there are
going to be there you can see the dark
right there it's still it's still there
the screen is still very responsive
however it's just that the smash that
happened right here looks like it
created these dead pixels over here so
you'll see it they almost look purple in
color there as you can see and yep
they're just a blemish that you're just
going to be seeing there from now on
if I kind of press down there it's
everything still works just fine there
which is really nice but yeah those are
the dead pixels there well here comes
the moment of truth the final one
dropping it right onto its screen I'll
just turn on the camera of the Xperia z2
so you can see that perspective and it's
recording so let's go all right just a
slight sidestep and
coming from her here all right whoo nice
flat drop nice flat drop whoo nice flat
drop
man I got to tell you I'm really happy
right now because aside from again the
flaps popping out you really don't have
any structural damage whatsoever this
screen is still fully operational those
dead pixels from the second test are
still there of course but aside from
that everything seems to be hunky-dory
when it comes to this Sony Xperia z2 I'm
going through the entire thing
let me just feel over on the sides a
little bit now if you remember in my
review I did mention that there's a
little bit of a lip that comes up from
these silver frames that is around the
sides but it looks like it might have
helped a little bit because it did fall
pretty flat but it looks like the impact
was not felt by the brunt of the screen
and thus we don't have any cracks across
the entire board there's really nothing
to complain about in terms of the
aesthetic of the phone still just a
couple of scuffs and those dead pixels
and all in all we still have a very
attractive device so as far as this drop
test goes the Sony Xperia z2 has passed
with flying colors
and so there you have it for this drop
test on the Sony Xperia z2 unlike the
Xperia z1 of last season this phone
despite still coming out looking very
great out of the box is also still very
functional it has pretty much everything
that you could need out of it nothing is
not working on the phone and that is
different from the z1 of last year which
even though it looked great after our
drop test it wasn't operational anymore
so the z2 passes with flying colors you
only have the dead pixels on the bottom
left a couple of scuffs around the frame
but that's about it this this is still a
phone that you could use on the daily
and still have a great time with it I
think that is a plus a huge win for the
Sony Xperia z2 so keep it tuned to
