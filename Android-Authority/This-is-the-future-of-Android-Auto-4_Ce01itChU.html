Authority and I wanted to take a minute
to talk about the new Android auto
features that Google is showing off at
Google i/o 2018 so the biggest thing to
announce here is that Android auto and
Google assistant are really now just
baked right into the car so you no
longer need to use your phone to use
features like maps and Spotify and all
those different things theoretically you
could have Spotify running you could
have maps running because as has its own
LTE chip now it's really up to the car
manufacturer whether they want to charge
you for this LTE connectivity but it's
just a concept that's showing like
what's possible when you can completely
just put Android auto in your car now
for example you could ask the assistant
to turn up your AC you could ask the
assistant to roll down your car windows
they really want the assistant to be
more baked into the car experience the
shooting car manufacturers like Android
OEMs so the manufacturers really get to
dictate what parts of Android Watteau
they want to have functionality in the
car google showed me a Dodge Ram 1500
concept which they outfitted themselves
which really just showed off a lot of
the different features I'm using Android
auto as the brains of the car so this
new version of auto is running on top of
Android PE and that really gives it some
new functionality it's now gonna have
support for the full Google Play Store
so it's really up to those app
developers whether they want to develop
apps that take advantage of the bigger
real estate in Android auto you can even
switch users so if you're logged into
your Spotify account and your spouse or
someone else is sharing the car with you
it also has a Spotify account they can
have a user account so that when they
get in the car to drive they just pick
their user account and it's already
logged into their Spotify to their
Google Maps and just to the Google
account in general now Volvo is the
first manufacturer that has committed to
using this new version of Android auto
and we'll probably see that hit the
market in the next few years our
manufacturers are going to put their own
version of Android auto in their cars so
think of it as if you have a red car
with a red interior you can have a red
background in Android auto if it's Volvo
you can have a little Volvo accents on
it it's really up to the manufacturer
how they want it to look but it's going
to use Android auto as the core brain
and the main features of
so your phone's not necessary anymore
but you can still connect it to the car
which gives you access to sending
messages to other people to playing
things directly off your phone so you
can still use Android auto like you used
to in a wireless sense but you're not
gonna actually need it if you just want
to use it for navigation and other
things like music almost the only one
that's actually said that they're gonna
roll this out in the next few years but
a lot more manufacturers are probably
going to be taking advantage of Android
auto in the near future what features do
you want to see present in your car via
Android auto let us know in the comment
