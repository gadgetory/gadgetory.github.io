brought to you by domain.com so this
past week saw more leaks surrounding the
LG g4 and it's getting me pretty excited
because these lakes are directly from LG
and they are working hard to
differentiate proving that we all reap
the fruit that we so so LG has made it
official April twenty-eighth will be the
big day where they announce the LG g4
and they gave us some details on this
new phone let's start with the camera
the g4 will pack a 16 megapixel sensor
up from the g3's 13 megapixel offering
along with the world's quote widest
aperture camera developed for a
smartphone it's f 1.8 aperture means
that the g4s camera will be able to take
an eighty percent more light than its
predecessor the g3 which given how good
the g3's camera was it makes us pretty
excited there are a number of benefits
to this wider aperture the main one
being the increased detail picked up in
low-light conditions thanks to the extra
light that it's received through the
camera module now let's talk the g4s new
you x ux four-point-oh boasts two new
main features a manual mode for the
handsets camera and improvements for its
smart notice application as you can see
here in the image LG's latest UI is
indeed a more vibrant flattened version
of its previous software with material
design inspired pastel colors dictating
the look and regarding the UX CEO jr.
Chow said this LG UX four-point-oh
offers simpler faster and more intuitive
ways to use the g4 with both new and
improved features that intelligently
accommodate each individual user now for
you HTC fans who long for a fingerprint
scanner you want to look at the HTC One
m9 plus last week HTC introduce the
newest member of the one family the m9
plus a larger m9 look-alike with a
couple of key differentiating features
the One m9 plus features a 5.2 inch quad
HD LCD display that's 2560 x 1440 and
not 5.5 inches as some rumors have
suggested
makes an HTC second quad HD device after
the 5.5 inch 19 plus which was released
just last week and technically superior
to the full HD m9 inside the m9 plus
features a 64-bit MediaTek Helio x10
processor with eight cortex a53 cores
running at up to 2.2 gigahertz and
integrated LTE as well as three
gigabytes of RAM now design wise the m9
plus is very similar to the one m9
featuring the same two tone silver
golden paint job and similar styling
however it will be easy to spot the m9
plus out thanks to the two distinctive
elements the fingerprint scanner on the
front and the dual camera on the back
the fingerprint sensor is touched based
not swiping though it's positioning and
especially at Samsung style appearance
is a bit questionable the duo camera on
the back is comprised of a 20 megapixel
main shooter along with a secondary
depth sensor just like the last years
and eight also like on the m8 the main
camera is rounded which arguably looks
better than the square style on the m9
the front shoot remains a 4 megapixel
ultrapixel camera now no word yet from
HTC about pricing and availability but
some believe that the HTC m9 plus might
be exclusive to China now with all the
hoopla surrounding the s6 edge bend test
and drop test Samsung has now provided
us with an in boxing the team at Samsung
tomorrow seems bent on taking the jobs
of US tech bloggers and youtubers by
releasing a sort of reverse tear down or
unboxing video showing how the six edge
can be assembled by hand to be clear
this isn't a full assembly guide the
operations are sped up and some steps
are missing completely like the crucial
gluing that adheres the display to the
battery with that said it's a great look
at what goes inside and a reminder about
the huge amount of complex work that
goes into fabricating our beloved
devices for a more technical look into
the innards of the s6 edge see the
ifixit teardown now good news for those
of you who have an iphone but have your
eye on an android wear SmartWatch the
verge is now suggesting that Google is
close to finish
Android wear app that would be
compatible with an iphone at this stage
of development Android wear on iphone
supports notifications and Google now
including cards and voice actions but by
its release it's also expected to bring
advanced integration with Google's own
applications including the ability to
reply to a message now Apple may or may
not approve such an app in the App Store
but a rejection by Apple isn't likely to
deter third-party developers who have
already successfully sort of got android
we're working on the iphone and an
official support from google would only
make the process easier I was just
thunder struck with a new domain name

domain.com you immediately get the power
to control what people find when they
search for you online and no domain name

brother's an Android Josh Joe and the
Texan G Kevin lon and Chris Barry and
Ashley Taylor all working super hard to
your source for all things Android
mmm so you stayed for this all right
think of this as a public service
announcement late last night i was up
surfing the web trying to figure out how
to grow my hair and i came upon a
lifehacker article written by our own
joe hindy where he loves the many
virtues of what he calls the king of
fruit durian fruit it's healthy he says
it tastes great he says what he forgot
to say is it smells like a steaming hot
pile of horse shoot think I'm
exaggerating this is real people trying
to eat during fruit horrible why would
Joe Hindy do this because he's trying to
kill you and me with fruit if you would
like to see justice be done and see Joe
Hindy eat the fruit please join me in
