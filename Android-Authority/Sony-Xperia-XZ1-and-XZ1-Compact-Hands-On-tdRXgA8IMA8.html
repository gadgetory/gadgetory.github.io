xperia x es + XE premium but in typical
Sony fashion Sony is ready to deliver us
some new high-end flagships but this
time around in a large and compact size
let's take a look at them and see what
they're like this is the sony xperia x z
1 and x z one compact if you've used
Sony phones in the past or have paid any
attention to Sony's mobile products at
all you'll know that their design hasn't
changed much over the last however many
years and that story for the most part
is still the same with the XZ 1 and X Z
one compact whether you see this as a
good or bad thing is totally up to you
but it is starting to look a little
dated especially in comparison to
everything else we're seeing this year
from other OEMs you still have thick
bezels with large top and bottom Chin's
on both devices but at least Sony's made
good use of the large top and bottom
bezels by putting front-facing speakers
on them Sony's front-facing speakers
have historically been pretty weak but
sony says there's a new smart amp now
that delivers 50% more sound pressure so
hopefully these speakers will sound a
lot better even though the xz1 compact
is basically the smaller version of the
XZ 1 there are some differences in the
design and build materials between these
two the XZ 1 has an all-metal body and
Sony's loop design that gives you
rounded sides and a slightly rounded top
and bottom that makes the phone look a
little less square and feel more
comfortable to hold the XC 1 compact is
a little more squareness design and the
body is made mostly out of plastic but
it does have some metal plates on the
top and bottom
despite the material differences it
still feels just as sturdy as the XC 1
and as the name suggests the more
compact size makes it pretty easy to use
in one hand the best part about the XZ 1
compact is that you're not sacrificing
any power because for the most part the
guts between the XZ 1 and X E 1 compact
is exactly the same they're both powered
by the Snapdragon 835 4 gigabytes of RAM
and feature a 2700 milliamp hour battery
ip68 water and dust resistance microSD
card slots for additional storage and a
fingerprint sensor embedded in the power
button but just like previous Sony
phones this feature won't make its way
onto US models for the displays the XE
one has a 5.2 inch 1080p display whereas
the XZ 1 compact has a 720p 4.6 inch
screen but there
both utilizing Sony's triluminos display
technology so aside from the resolution
you shouldn't see much of a difference
between the two in terms of color and
overall quality where these two devices
start to get interesting is on the back
they both come with a 19 megapixel
camera that Sony is dubbing motion I
this means the camera is capable of
capturing unexpected motion a lot easier
and can even capture unexpected emotions
such as a child smiling and it does this
by capturing photos a couple seconds
before the actual photo is taken you
still have all the other Sony camera
features that you might expect like
predictive hybrid autofocus 5 axis image
stabilization and super slow motion but
the real kicker to the camera this year
is its 3d scanning capabilities which is
pretty wild for a smartphone you can map
a 3d image of pretty much anything from
people to food and from the short demo
that I saw it looked really impressive
these 3d images can be used for
augmented reality custom wallpapers
gaming avatars and even be 3d printed
the software is also worth mentioning
they're both running Android of course
but you might be surprised to know that
both the X C 1 and X C 1 compact will be
shipping with Google's brand spanking
new OS Android 8.0 Oreo it's a little
hard to tell with Sony's somewhat dated
UI skins sitting on top of it but it's
awesome to have the latest version of
Android right out of the box the big
question is will Sony be able to keep
these phones updated in a timely manner
that's not something we'll know the
answer to till several months down the
road but for now we can enjoy that the
XZ 1 and X II one compact have the most
up-to-date software from Google and all
its Oreo goodness so that wraps up this
quick hands-on look of the sony xz1 and
xz1 compact
what do you guys think of Sony's new
pair of flagship smartphones are they
more of the same or has Sony done enough
this time around to make them different
