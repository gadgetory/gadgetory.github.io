Jason this week we find out about
Samsung Galaxy s5 possible release date
and some sad news regarding cyanogenmod
and how we are all getting scroogled
will at least according to Microsoft you
see the tech giant has been ratcheting
up their anti-google campaign as of late
not just with a commercial but with
anti-google merchandise such as t-shirts
and hoodies and what was mother google's
official response like this Microsoft's
latest venture comes as no surprise
competition in the wearable space is
really heating up now Microsoft you can
say you've been screwed now I know the
some of you said you were amazed by the
room at galaxy s5 specs some of you said
I was probably just all hype and
marketing don't get your hopes up while
others said just the sound of those
specs made you aroused my friend that
was an overshare TM of course android
authority has been trying to dig deep
and sort that out and what we found is
that we may not have to wait as long as
we thought to see if those rumors are
true according dt news the galaxy s5
will hit production lines in 2014 up to
three months earlier than expected and
lots in March or April again earlier
than expected now this isn't the first
time we've heard that Samsung might be
interested in launching the Galaxy S
model sooner than anticipated perhaps in
order to make up for the slower galaxy
s4 sales last week we shared with you
the news that cyanogenmod arguably the
most popular custom rom out there was
added to the google play store this
allowed even mainstream users the power
to customize their mobile OS the way
they wanted how they wanted it yes I
know many of you were just giddy with
excitement oh my goodness itself yes but
sadly I must tell you that cyanogenmod
has been removed from the google play
store because as Google States it
encourages users to avoid their warranty
oh my koi I swear you say that again
I'll give you such a pouch yes I feel
your pain I do and many other Android
enthusiasts are up in arms about it too
but you should know that this isn't much
of a conspiracy because Google has been
consistent about this and it's not a
first-time event
google has been consistent in its
banning of apps that allow users to root
the device and void the warranty the
easy route app was banned three years
ago as was the Thunderbolt root and rage
against the cage app since then dear
friends this story has exploded a bit
beyond to where it needs to you see
Android is open source it's not open
season there are limits to how far that
open source can go Google will limit the
access to any developer who threatens
Google's dominance within the Android
ecosystem it's not a conspiracy it's
just a business decision now be sure to
check out our own Android whisperer Joe
Hindy who goes into the subject in a
little bit more detail he may have lost
his hair but he has not lost his Android
mojo moving on to screw billing in
Microsoft's commercial a Chromebook
owner comes in looking to sell their
device for some extra cash to go to
Hollywood Rick from Pawn Stars quickly
informed the Hollywood wannabe that
without Wi-Fi the Google powered laptop
is quote not a real laptop nevermind the
fact that there's a growing number of
offline apps Rick then goes on to
explain that this Chromebook is just
another way for Google to steal your
data and sell ads he concludes that he
can't buy the laptop because he does not
want to get scroogled scroogled who knew
so where to begin where to begin I mean
Microsoft has made up of a lot of smart
people they are smarter than me and they
must know what i know and i know that
microsoft's future is not in my mother's
generation my mother's generation may be
fooled by this misleading half-truth
ridden ad and not by a Chromebook but
the next generation the generation why
those Millennials they're much smarter
than that and they only want devices
that are connected the Chromebook
identifies the things that they really
really want so it's hard to not look at
Microsoft is really desperate in this
commercial and yes Google does mine our
data and sell it for relevant ads I get
that but I'd rather do that than pay for
those services directly especially
because Google does provide some means
to manage how that data is used I can
basically turn it on or off right now in
my
google account so pretty lady some might
say you didn't get scroogled you got
micro dick thanks for watching Android
peeps I always have lots of fun chatting
with you here if you have any questions
for this Wednesday's Android Q&amp;amp;A please
put them in the comments below and I
will be sure to get to them I do read
all your comments take care and listen
here buckaroos if there's any more nasty
comments regarding Jace I swear to God I
will scratch your eyes out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
