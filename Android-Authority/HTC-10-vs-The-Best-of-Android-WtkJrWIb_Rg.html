Transportation National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration you drive you text
you pay to find out just how much the
HGC is all hype we have a spec showdown
while other manufacturers were
relatively quick to hop on the quad HD
resolution train HTC has kept at 1080p
resolution for all its previous
flagships this all changes with the HTC
10 though as the manufacturer moves up
to competing in qHD super LCD display
that will offer a little extra sharpness
to match the sexiness of the s7 and the
LG g5 add 5 to 5.5 inches the difference
between 1080p and qHD is not massive but
it's not a minor con that can be held
against HTC s latest flagship anymore
the more telling question will be to see
how this resolution upgrade and packs
the performance of battery life which
we'll find out when we get our full
review
fortunately HTC managed to pack in a
suitable size battery the handset
features a three thousand milliamp hour
cell which stacks up well against the
galaxy s7 and s7 edges three thousand
and thirty six hundred milli amp hour
sizes it's also slightly larger than LG
g5 s 2,800 milliamp hour and Xperia X's
performances of twenty seven hundred
million power unlike last year most of
this year's flagship smartphones have
settled on a single processor the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 there's still
some exceptions though the Samsung
Galaxy s7 offers the company's own
Exynos 88-90 system on a chip in many
regions outside the US the new Huawei p9
also ops to use its own in-house kuren
955 processor which is much more like
the octa-core processors that dominate
last year's field there's also not much
to tell between the handsets in terms of
RAM or memory options although the
xperia x performance is a little behind
with just three gigabytes of RAM
performance should be very similar if
not virtually identical across all these
handsets
although the lower resolution of the
sony xperia x and Huawei's p9s displays
might lend them an edge in terms of
gaming situations UI optimizations may
also make some
minor differences Samsung has stripped
back TouchWiz a little why Sony and HTC
have typically offered slightly more
lightweight default launchers smartphone
camera technology remains a big selling
point this year as all manufacturers in
our list are touting notable
improvements over their previous
generation flagships HTC has long used
its so-called
ultra pixel terminology to describe its
larger light-collecting sensors but
there's a surprising similarity between
the image sensors found in the HTC 10
and the galaxy s7 this time around both
handsets boast a 12 megapixel main
camera with similar apertures and pixel
sizes for additional light capture the
galaxy s7 s camera is proven to be a
real winner so there's a lot to be
excited about with this similar SPECT
HTC 10 however the HTC 10 does not
feature the fast auto focusing subpixels
found in the s7 although you will find a
laser autofocus module on the HTC
handset a feature that LG had for a
while now and one that Huawei has just
adopted with the p9 the HTC 10 doesn't
boast an IP rating for dust or water
resistance so it's either the xperia x
performance or the galaxy s7 if you're
looking to take your smartphone for a
quick dunk speaking of more unique
features the galaxy s7 and LG 5 feature
always-on display technology which can
help save battery life when glancing at
your phone to simply check the time or
see if you have a new notification while
the Huawei p9 is the only option if you
want a force touch display audio remains
a key selling point for the HTC flagship
series and the HTC 10 boasts HiFi I do
read across the board we'll have to see
how the phone stacks up against the g5
however the 10 doesn't feature
front-facing speakers anymore boom sound
does return but there's one speaker on
the front top and one on the bottom
making it a more familiar setup to other
phones on the market the inclusion of a
dedicated subwoofer is an intriguing
design choice but we're skeptical about
how much of a difference it will make
due to the limited speaker size the LG
g5 in the agency 10 boasts Qualcomm's
quick-charge 3.0 technology while the
other phones on the market settled for
last year's 2.0 version the 3.0 upgrade
doesn't
make a notable difference in charge time
but it is more efficient and might mean
that your phone doesn't heat up as much
during charging so after reading a lot
of the comments my sense is that most of
you are really excited about the g5 so
now that you've seen the HTC 10 have
they stolen some of LG's thunder let me
know what you think in the comments
below
all right let's admit it we all know it
we've all texted while driving what you
may not know is that thousands of people
a year die from distracted related
crashes like texting while driving and
law enforcement right across the u.s.
have really upped their game and they've
initiated an intensive campaign whereby
they're searching for those of us
texting while driving and if they find
you they will write a ticket so be smart
be safe don't text while driving
remember you drive you text you pay for
