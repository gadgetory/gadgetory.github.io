Android Authority hey guys it's crystal
or from Android authority and his Josh
regard from Android authority what's
going on everybody and welcome to kind
of a special way that we're looking at
three of the main flagships that have
come out this year thus far we're taking
a look at the LG g5 the Samsung Galaxy
s7 and the HTC 10 now since we have
those three particular phones to talk
about we didn't really want to do a
bunch of vs. we thought we would get
together and just discuss them and this
will be what we call your triple threat
versus and we're going to discuss these
phones at length now the thing that I do
need to make sure you guys all know is
that if you want the more my new details
like the spec sheets or even more
opinions on these particular phones you
can always find the full reviews here at
the YouTube channel or you can head over
to Android or decom for the full written
reviews on all three of these devices
and of course we have all of the best
coverage for each and every one of these
devices including this Triple Threat vs.
so without any further ado we are going
to get right into it we'll go section by
section and we are going to talk about
particular phones that we picked or
maybe not so much picked but we're the
ones that are going to be giving
information on a particular phone and I
think we'll start off InDesign with lawn
over there with the probably the most
different phone of this year probably
the g5 the LG g5 has a brand new design
it's made entirely of metal now but it
also has what LG is calling a micro guys
encoding which basically is just sort of
their marketing lingo for it means the
phone has been painted and covered in a
primer so it doesn't feel quite like a
true metal phone you don't get that same
cold feel that you'd get with other
phones out there that are just bare
aluminum now the new thing about the g5
is that it has a modular design so that
means that the bottom is actually
removable and you can get access to the
battery and you can actually still
remove and swap out different batteries
so that hasn't changed even though the
design has this also means that you have
a bunch of different what LG likes to
call friends there because they're not
actually all modules here so there's
only a couple that are module
and the rest are actually either a
Bluetooth peripheral or connected by USB
so you have the the camera grip and then
you also have the Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen
high-five deck and the camera grip will
give you physical controls and dials
over controlling the camera and then you
have the hi-fi DAC which will give you
better quality audio and that's
basically what the LG g5 is all about in
terms of design alright so going from
the g5 I guess we'll go ahead and pop
over to crystal for the Samsung Galaxy
s7 and yes we are going to talk about
the s7 edge as well yeah so with the s7
and the s7 edge we see what we're used
to the glass backing metal frame nothing
too new um but as always a solid solid
design slightly thicker this year
because we're housing a bigger battery
and we have the slightly curved edges on
the back like what we saw in the note 5
and of course with the s7 edge we have
the curved display on the front which is
mostly there for it to look cool but
there are some added features of that
two edge panels which we'll get to later
alright so pretty standard affair from
Samsung Galaxy s7 and s7 edge this year
which brings us to the HTC 10 which will
be the phone that I'm talking about I
have it right here
so the HTC 10 brings back the metal
design that HTC has always been known
for and this time around they've taken
it and made it just that little bit
bigger if you imagine HTC One m8 they
just sort of added a little bit on the
edges around here to create this
silhouetted look so this chamfered edge
provides a little bit of a subtle
aesthetic that I think makes the phone
look really nice that said however you
have the metal construction that when
you're handling in one hand it's not
that hard to grip because the 5.2 inch
screen is not too big especially for
those that of us that like smaller
phones but even then the metal
construction is really premium it feels
really nice even if it does slip around
quite a bit now the main change is of
course going to be on the front of which
you don't have the boom sound speakers
the dual front-facing speakers I should
say you have one on the top there with a
woofer on the bottom of the phone which
will then add more to the let's say
lower mids but definitely the lows when
it comes to audio overall the HTC 10
does feel a lot like the kind of phone
that HTC should have been making up
until now especially with this very
stealthy grey this dark grey in black it
just looks really nice in
in terms of design if you're looking for
a metal phone this just might be the one
that you're looking for at least for me
I do think it's a great metal device but
that brings us over to display and
display should be a pretty easy one to
talk about here especially considering
that the HTC ten has a quad HD display
now but as we have discussed on a number
of different occasions all three of us
here on the YouTube side AMOLED screens
tend to be the ones that we're always
picking the most right and I guess we
can sort of go through a couple reasons
why yeah well with AMOLED we have
individual pixels being wet versus one
big backlight which I think in my
opinion gives like the more immersive
experience when you're looking at videos
there's going to text things just like
pop out at you more and also the colors
are just more punchy in your face and
something that I think most people like
with family more and also you get other
features like you could add night clocks
and I clocks look better and certain
apps have dark themes which are cool to
some battery saving too but overall it
just you get the more immersive and
engulfing experience when looking at an
AMOLED display now if there's one thing
that the HTC 10 is lacking I'm going to
go and turn off the screen right here
it doesn't have an always-on display but
if you were to compare the samsung
galaxy s7 and the LG g5 lawn always-on
display on the g5 kind of lacking a
little bit don't you think yeah so the
LG g5 does have an always-on display but
it's a little bit lacking in comparison
to the galaxy s7 s because it's not
quite as bright and that's just
basically due to the nature of the LCD
panel and it just it drains a little bit
more battery if they had to crank the
brightness all the way up so they
basically had to just keep it dim in
order to save battery you can still see
it when you're indoors but when you're
outdoors and it's a sunny day you can
pretty much kind of forget about it
you're not going to be able to see the
information that is showing and it's
also a little bit limited and what it
can do it can show you the clock and it
can show you a message of whatever you
want it to say and that's really about
it and also give you notifications of a
variety of different apps even
third-party apps which is probably the
only leg up it has over the Samsung
version but otherwise it's kind of a
kind of a ho-hum feature on the g5 yeah
and in the HTC 10 it is a what they call
a Super LCD 5 right here and it does
provide some pretty good saturation if
we're going to talk about AMOLED
displays and just how high the
saturation is well HTC is trying to go
for the NTSC standard now with that in
mind I don't think that personally I
don't think that the HTC 10 screen is
really a slouch at all it does have
really good coloration even if it
doesn't quite stand up to the AMOLED and
in that regard probably the g5 might be
kind of doubling back just a little bit
in this ranking so far when it comes to
display but the differences kind of stop
in this upcoming section which is
performance now it's pretty easy for us
to talk about performance here because
every single one of these flagship
phones have exactly the same type of
specifications that you would expect and
lawn what are those so basically you're
looking at a Snapdragon 820 processor
Adreno 530 and 4 gigabytes of RAM across
the board on all of these devices so you
can pretty much expect fast performance
on all these phones and it's really just
going to come down to the software
optimization as to where you'll see any
differences but otherwise they're pretty
much all going to run pretty much
identical yeah and we can pretty much go
down the line as well as to say have we
had any problems with these phones I
would say no lawn will probably say no
and crystal on the Samsung Galaxy s7
have you had any issues with performance
thus far it's a very smooth experience
overall like we're used to but I would
say one thing I mean the briefing screen
is still there which you could disable
the lag is a lot less apparent this year
than last year so it's much worse this
years a lot more improved and that's
pretty much the only complaint when it
comes to performance all right and that
brings us to hardware which might be one
of the most exciting portions of this
particular Triple Threat vs. because
every single one of these phones at
least in my estimation has something to
really offer and I'll start off with the
HTC 10 now we have the HTC 10 here with
obviously the boomsound speakers and
that has always been an offering by HTC
but this year it's a little bit
different because on the bottom here if
they've taken out one of the speakers in
order to make a fingerprint scanner fit
there which does work pretty well you
just have to hold on to that capacitive
home button keep your finger there and
it will unlock and wake simultaneously
nice and quick but that also means that
boom sound now has a front facing
speaker on
the top of the device and then on the
bottom there is a woofer on the bottom
that helps with the low ends in the
audio now that's not really to say that
these speakers are incredibly loud
especially not when compared to previous
HTC one devices or even the Nexus 6p now
but it still provides a nice rich sound
if you're going to be sharing your audio
with everybody just using the phone you
might find it just that little bit
quieter than you would want it to be but
it's really when you plug in headphones
on here that really make it awesome and
that's because boom sound has an amp and
a deck a nice 24 bit DAC rather
installed on the phone that will allow
for some really nice sound stages in a
good pair of headphones so when it comes
to the audio or the music listening
experience the HTC 10 is really pretty
much the ACE player in these if I if I
would say so myself from there you do
have a microSD card slot which has been
an offering before but it is one of
those features that is coming back a lot
this year after that it's not a
waterproof device it is splash proof but
it's certification is not as high as
that of the galaxy s7 but overall you
get a really solid device with USB
type-c on the bottom and quick charge
3.0 so with being able to charge up the
battery pretty quickly which we'll talk
about in a bit you have overall a very
good and solid device with a wonderful
audio experience alright well we talked
about the HTC 10 just now how about the
galaxy s7 and the s7 edge over there so
with the galaxy s7 and s7 edge we have
the physical home button that doubles as
a fingerprint scanner and it's fast you
do have to actually press on the button
for it to unlock but it is super fast
it's not really a big big shouldn't be a
big issue moving along we have the
microUSB charging port on the bottom and
then we have the speaker on the bottom
and it's pretty poor placement and it's
also not the best speaker quality
suffers a little bit kind of tinny but
that's because the phone is
water-resistant we have a protective
coating inside which is a big thing with
hardware here on the s7 and the last
thing would be we have the micro SD card
slot on the top that holds up to 200
gigs alright and after the galaxy s7 of
course our last phone number three the
LG g5 / Woodlawn alright so with the LG
g5 you have 32 gigabytes of internal
storage and you also
have a microSD card slot that allows up
to an additional 200 gigabytes of
additional storage for storing all of
your extra media and then along the
bottom here you have a USB type-c port
which also accepts fast charging which
is nice and the speaker is also on the
bottom of the phone here and it's
obviously not the best placement in the
world but it is a pretty decent sounding
speaker for a single speaker definitely
a little bit better than the galaxy s7
on the back side you have the power
button still mounted on the rear which
also doubles as a fingerprint scanner
and the fingerprint scanner works quite
well it's actually really fast
definitely one of the fastest
fingerprint scanners that I've ever used
it takes only a few taps to set up and
you actually don't have to press the
power button in order for it to actually
register your fingerprint one thing
you'll notice is that the volume rockers
are actually no longer on the back here
either they've been moved back to the
side on a more traditional location
which is perfectly fine by me but
depending on who you are you may or may
not like that change alright and because
the bottom portion can be removed of
course we have replaceable batteries
after all the battery has to be snapped
out and put into other modules but we'll
go ahead and pop in to the battery life
here what's the capacity in the g5 lawn
and that battery what has been the
battery life for you so far
yeah so the capacity on the g5 is a
twenty eight hundred milli ampere hour
battery which is the smallest of the
bunch out of these three phones but the
benefit here is that you actually can
still remove it and swap it out for
another one and for me battery life has
actually been pretty good it gets me
through a full day perfectly fine the
screen on time numbers aren't amazing
but for me what really matters is how it
performs in regular everyday use and for
me up with my usage with just browsing
the web checking social media watching
YouTube and playing some games and
things like that it last me through a
full day pretty much every single day
yeah I would say the same thing for the
HTC 10 as a 3000 milliamp hour battery
which seems like pretty much what you
would want in a phone these days but
with that in mind it gets through a full
day pretty much as much as you would
need it to and screen on time for me has
been around for hours on average which
is pretty good especially for someone
like me that has the screen on for
things like GPS I'm listening to
using all the time so for a somewhat
above average user like myself four
hours of screen on time has been
perfectly fine but that's where we get
to the Galaxy s7 and the s7 edge which
has a big battery and how is battery
life been for you crystal yeah well as
we know much better than last year's at
six we have a bigger battery so we have
3000 milliamp hours on the s7 and 2600 I
believe on the s7 edge and I with
moderate use I get through a full day
easily I would say about four hours on
the s7 and four and a half hours like
five hours on the s7 edge
yeah and across the board we have fast
charging so even if you do find yourself
in single digits on your battery life
you can always pop it in for just a
little bit and get that power back all
right which brings us to the cameras now
this is always a hotly debated topic
especially when it comes to these three
flagships every single year and in one
case we do have a camera that is hoping
to improve on what has been lackluster
over the last couple of years we have a
camera experience in both the Samsung
and LG camps that have provided some
pretty good experiences thus far and
we'll see how they are this year we'll
start off with the Samsung Galaxy s7 and
the s7 edge though what are the specs
and sort of the details when it comes to
both cameras on this phone well we have
a 12 megapixel rear shooter and the five
megapixel front shooter with the
wide-angle and these cameras are super
super reliable cameras whether you're
taking a picture daylight or low-light
you can always be confident in knowing
that you're going to take a good shot we
will talk about the LG g5 coming up next
so cameras on this which i think is a
very very fun prospect for you alright
so the camera on the LG g5 is a 16
megapixel F 1.8 aperture lens so they
didn't go the route of Samsung or HTC
with the fewer megapixels they decided
to stay with 16 but the interesting
thing about the g5 s camera this year is
that there's actually two lenses here so
you actually have a secondary 8
megapixel sensor and the 8 megapixel
sensor is a wide-angle lens which allows
you to take these really awesome looking
incredible looking wide-angle shots and
it's just a lot of fun to use probably
my favorite feature of the g5 actually
as far as the front camera goes you have
in 8 megapixel sensors so you're going
to get
pretty decent looking selfies with that
it's really nothing too special but it
should get the job done as far as your
front-facing camera goes all right which
brings us the HTC ten now the last
couple of years HTC has had kind of a
rough go of it when it comes to the two
cameras especially when you're talking
about the rear camera they've won
they've gone from ultra pixel to the
more conventional cameras but this year
much like Samsung Galaxy s7 did we have
the ultra pixels coming back there the
larger pixels but there are less of them
so 12 megapixels similar to the s7 is
what you get in the HTC 10 that said you
also have a 5 megapixel camera up front
that has optical image stabilization
built in now like I said every single
one of these phones does have kind of a
killer feature not really killer but
let's say a feature that you can really
kind of be happy about and I personally
think that the OIS on the front-facing
camera is a very nice addition but the
other really great addition is the great
audio recording high res audio can be
recorded no matter which camera you're
using so if you're a bit of a vlogger or
if you're really looking towards video
as what you're going to do with these
phones then you will be able to do that
with the HTC 10 from there you have the
12 megapixel shots that are done in the
HTC camera app and in the app it has
been somewhat streamlined very easy to
use a lot of the modes are over on the
left side so for the most part you could
just use one hand in order to get a shot
off and the speed of the camera app is
pretty good as well it's manual mode
leaves a little bit to be desired not
necessarily in terms of how many things
you can change but the fact that all of
those sliders cover up if you have all
those sliders open at one so you can
cover up the entire viewfinder which is
a little bit annoying but from there we
have given you some information about
these different cameras then well now
we're going to talk about the picture
quality because we took pictures with
all three of these phones in a bunch of
different situations and it's these
pictures that were going to use to give
our opinions on what we think might be a
better camera so lawn actually had a lot
of really pertinent things to say about
this comparison yes so we all sort of
had a chance to take a look at all these
photos I think we sort of came to sort
of the same consensus and took away a
few themes if you will from all these
camera samples the first thing that we
noticed right away is that the HTC 10
sort of over exposes a lot with their
images and also it lacked the images
lack a lot of color and contrast
in comparison to the g5 and the s7 they
just look a little bit muted and a
little bit washed out another thing that
we noticed is that the s7 has pretty
good dynamic range and if you compare to
something like the g5 you can definitely
see how much better it is in the shadows
whereas on the g5 the g5 tends to really
sort of crush those areas and you sort
of lose a lot of detail and you'll sort
of see that in some of these car images
especially if you look in the darker
grill areas of the car you can see those
details on the galaxy s7 whereas on the
g5 they're really dark and it sort of
just looks more like a black hole
instead of an actual grill so if you had
this kind of experience crystal with the
s7 and the s7 edge do you believe that
it is the most reliable camera let's use
that word oh definitely for sure the
most hands-down of the three I would say
reliable you did like I said before I
always be confident knowing that that
shot that you take will be a decent shot
with a g5 I noticed that since it has a
doesn't have that larger pixel size at
night you I believe it decreases the
shutter speed to account for more light
into the shot and because of that you
get almost blurry images like hazy not
as focused sharp images at night well
with the HTC 10 I do agree with
everything that one said we did talk
about this for a bit so the picture
quality is actually pretty much on par
on the HTC 10 it just doesn't really
excel in any one particular place except
for audio which again like I said if
video is going to be the thing the audio
is so good I just released a camera
feature focus on and you can hear me
actually vlogging on the HTC 10 in the
audio sounds amazing
from there however there is a little bit
of a lack of saturation and a little bit
of a lack of sharpness but that is also
something you see in the galaxy s7 from
time to time because it has less pixel
on megapixels and they are larger pixels
of course but at least with the s7
they've leveraged that for better
autofocus whereas HTC has sort of just
kept two laser autofocus for what it
uses for focusing systems but the HTC
ten by any means is not the worst camera
out there it's just not also the best
one so that should pretty much do it for
the camera section we can move on to our
final section before we give you our
full opinions on these phones we'll talk
about the software now we have three
different
versions of Android here and I think
everyone has a lot of opinions no matter
which one you get I'm going to start off
though we have the HTC ten with a very
Google esque sense on here so there's no
more sense versions or anything like
that it's just Android with HTC Sense
and if you're used to since in the past
you get a very familiar looking
interface here with the app drawer that
is a paginated scroll going up and down
rather than side-to-side and then of
course you have blinkfeed over on the
side now blinkfeed to me has always been
my favorite news aggregation second home
screen experience and I've always
enjoyed it more than briefing or
anything that LG has put out for their
second home screens that they've changed
it up a few times but ultimately what I
love the most about sense is that
everything just sort of no pun intended
makes sense everything is exactly where
you would want it to be there's not
really any flourishes it's not trying
too hard to look like eye candy it's a
very functional version of Android and
because it has a darker tone about it it
doesn't look too cartoony in pretty much
any portion of it and it just feels like
function is king in this version of
Android but that would bring us over if
we're going to look at the two spectrums
I guess we can go over to the galaxy s7
and see how TouchWiz is this year well
TouchWiz I believe just gets better
every year and this year it is better
you have more of a tone down color
scheme you don't have like that neon
green blue that we saw last year you
have more of a like blue grayish color
scheme which I prefer but of course you
can always change that in the theme
store too or get a new home launcher and
then of course the icons I would say are
a bit cartoony like and I see this with
the g5 too but once again you can always
change that with the home launcher as
far as features that we get with soft
areas we have multitasking which is
always a good feature and edge panels on
s7 edge you get shortcuts to contacts
emails bunch of stuff you have a bunch
of widgets pretty much but I said this
before and I really think the purpose of
that curved edge just for the design
aspect to make it look cool but then
edge panel is always good if you
remember that it's there it's always
good to make the phone experience that
look faster and a lot easier to use
which
is over to the LG g5 and the return of
the LG in this case is called the UX
it's not the UI anymore the LG u X so
with LG g5 you have Android 6.0
marshmallow like the rest of these
devices but you're dealing with LG's
custom interface on top and it's still
not the best looking interface but it's
probably the best that it's ever looked
so it's a little bit cartoony still as
far as the icons go and some of the
animations are also a little bit
cartoony but it's a little bit cleaner
as far as the color scheme goes and a
lot of these software features that LG
used to shove in your face like the
smart bulletin and the qslide are
actually a little bit more hidden now
but they are still there if you actually
want to use them now the biggest change
with LG's interface is time around is
that there is no app drawer by default
so all of your icons and all your
applications will be sitting on your
home screens and your only real form of
organization is through folders but you
do have the option to bring that app
drawer back via a third-party launcher
like Google now apex or Nova or if you
really want to stick to LG software LG
did release their LG home 4.0 launcher
in the smart world app if you want to
download that one alright so we have a
lot of different ends of the spectrum
here with these three phones but before
I even get into any of our opinions I
want to just remind everybody that to
find even more details about all of
these phones make sure you check out our
full reviews here on Android authority
comm and the YouTube channel so you can
see everything that you need to know
specifically about these three devices
which brings us to what we're here for
and that is our final section which one
of these phones would you pick so I'm
going to go ahead and have everybody say
what phone that they would pick and I
want you guys to explain why I want to
start off with lawn over there so even
though I'm speaking about the LG g5 and
even though it is a pretty solid smart
phone I'm going to have to give it to
the s7 more specifically the galaxy s7
edge mostly because I feel like they
really refined that particular design
they took a risk with that design last
year and this year they really sort of
made it a little bit better and it sort
of is paying off for them now it's got a
bigger display a bigger battery the edge
functionality is actually a little
more useful now so a lot of the changes
that they made this year to the s7 edge
have only improved this particular
smartphone and it's a really fantastic
smartphone from Samsung yeah I think I
would
for the most part agree the galaxy s7 if
you take it for all that it is it is
pretty much the most reliable the most
well rounded phone but I also will have
to admit that when it comes to having a
lot of fun on smartphones I do agree
that the camera is the number one
feature that I'm always looking for
until HTC came out with the audio boom
sound cap has a capabilities of the HTC
10 if there's one thing I do far more
than use the camera its listen to music
and as I listen to music on the boom
sound amp and the 24 bit DAC on here
with my audio Technica's I just have
such a good experience with it I just
have so much fun with it that I have to
say that if I had to pick one phone
solely for a daily driver considering
that I already have a way of filming and
taking pictures and whatnot with a great
design and just a super-fun audio
experience and a decent enough camera
which I will emphasize it's not the best
one but it's a decent enough camera I do
have to give it to the HTC 10 I mean
everybody is going to have a Samsung
Galaxy s7 that's obvious I viewed I used
one as a daily driver for quite a while
but with the HTC 10 you're probably
gonna be walking around and not too many
other people have it and then that is
where you get people asking wow what
phone is that because that's what the
HTC One the m7 DMA that's what those
phones used to do and I think that the
10 is still capable of doing that and it
happens to be a pretty solid phone all
around underneath that surface anyway I
think it's going to be 2 out of 3 here
for the galaxy s7 and since crystal is
the one who gave us the info on the
galaxy s7 I guess you can explain to us
why well yeah I'm I'd have to go with
the galaxy s7 as well just because like
you said I'm big on camera and I take a
lot of pictures and I want an all-around
just reliable camera even though all
these phones are great and I know all
cameras are great here especially the g5
being a super-fun camera and I think in
some areas the g5 is better than s7 but
the s7 all-around is a reliable
experience then with HTC 10 like I said
haven't used it I know it's also a good
camera but yeah I'd have to go with the
s7 just because of that reliability and
being
knowing that I'm going to take a good
shot no matter what and that really is
the most important thing to me well
unless there's anything else that's left
I think that should pretty much do it
for this Triple Threat vs. we wanted to
get three of our YouTube creators here
to talk to you about the three flagships
that have been coming this year and they
are the top three phones and we wanted
to bring you a comparison among all
three of them in a sort of more casual
more easily digestible format so
hopefully you guys enjoyed that let us
know if you did in the comments below
and drop us some likes on this video if
you did enjoy this version of the vs.
format from there we might do these a
little bit more but again you can always
see our content for all of these phones
at Android or decom and of course here
at the YouTube channel if you haven't
already make sure you guys subscribe
that should pretty much do it for this
vs. video so altogether guys we are your
source remember that we are your source
for all things Android Android
