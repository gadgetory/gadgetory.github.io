Android Authority and today's video is
going to be all about me and I know a
lot of you guys have been wondering who
exactly it is that I am what am I doing
here on Android authority of stuff like
that I've seen it in the comments
section so today I'm going to try to
answer that question and on top of
answering that question I'm going to
give you five facts about me to give you
guys the chance to know me a little bit
better both inside the world of tech and
outside of it as well so with that being
said let's go ahead and get started
all right so starting off with FAQ
number one and this is probably going to
be the most obvious fact of them all and
that is my love for technology and my
passion for it and my love for
technology extends beyond smartphones
and tablets I also love other things
like cameras computers cars a huge fan
of cars I don't drive the fanciest car
in the world I have a Scion tC that I've
done some stuff to so it's not the
fanciest thing in the world but I do
love that car and I've loved working on
it I don't really do a whole lot of to
it anymore because it kind of got a
little bit expensive but I'll show you
guys what it looks like or what it used
to look like anyways it looks a little
bit different now but just to give you
guys a general idea of what my car looks
like and what I've done to it so I
really love technology and that is
essentially what got me here to Android
authority one day I just decided to
reach out to them on a whim I didn't
really think too much about it I just
you know shot them an email saying hey I
really love technology I love talking
about it and I also have experience with
making videos so it's not like I just
you know randomly start making videos on
a whim I have made videos before in the
past I have my own personal channel that
I make videos for and that essentially
sort of served as a resume if you will
as far as reaching out to the guys here
Android Authority letting them know
you know my love for technology and my
experience with making videos etc
so I reached out to them didn't really
hear back for a few weeks but I didn't
really think about it at all I just you
know I just kind of forgot about it to
be honest with you but I eventually
heard back and we after that it was
pretty much history from that point on
we just sort of talked about all the
different details and my particular role
on the Android authority team and Here I
am now making videos for you guys
getting to do what I love getting to
talk about technology for a living so
it's pretty awesome and I've been having
a good time doing it hopefully you guys
have been enjoying it as well but
hopefully that answers your question as
to where it is that I came from what am
i doing on android authoritative fact
number one moving along to fact number
two and fact number two is as much as I
love technology and as passionate as I
am about it it's actually not my number
one passion my number one passion is
actually dancing I am actually a b-boy
or breakdancer if you want to call it
that I also do hip hop choreography as
well and I've done some other styles
outside of my comfort zone like ballroom
ballroom is actually a lot of fun if you
like partner stuff so I thoroughly enjoy
that but I've been dancing for a while
now I'm 27 about to be 28 my birthday is
on June 1st if you really must know so
it is coming up but I've been dancing
ever since I was 16 or 17 so it's been a
while now I didn't start dancing without
when I was a kid or anything like that
but still a pretty long time and the
reason why I started dancing was because
in high school I never really fit in and
everybody sort of you know had their own
thing they either played football or
baseball or something like that and I
wanted a way to sort of identify myself
so I started dancing and I always a hat
I always had a fascination with dancing
every time I saw somebody do any sort of
breakdancing in a video or something
like that
I always thought it was really cool so
one day I figured why not give it
try so I decided to go on YouTube and
just look up a bunch of tutorials on how
to dance
most specifically breakdancing and this
is back in the day when YouTube was like
still in like 240p 360p all that stuff
but there was actually quite a handful
of breakdancing tutorials on YouTube and
just tutorials on how to dance in
general so I just started watching these
tutorial videos and started teaching
myself and once I actually started
learning of different moves I realized
that I thoroughly enjoyed dancing and
that was really when I started to fall
in love with dancing and I've been doing
it ever since it's become a huge passion
of mine and a very big part of my life a
very influential part of my life and
it's it's Who I am as a person I just
love to dance and I will continue to
keep on dancing for as long as I am able
to I don't have any videos of me dancing
but I do have some photos which I will
post up so you guys can sort of see me
in action but dancing has become a very
big part of my life and it's what I like
to do when I'm feeling stressed out and
I just want to get away from the rest of
the world everybody sort of has that one
thing whether it's playing the guitar
singing or reading a book whatever it is
that you do to sort of get away from
everything dancing is what I like to do
and again I will continue to do it for
as long as I am able to so next up is
FAQ number three and that is this guy
right here which I shamefully admit I
have not framed up yet but fact number
three is I have an accounting degree so
I did go to college and I did graduate I
went to the University of Missouri
Kansas City which is known as UMKC not
to be confused with University of
Missouri which is known as mu they are
affiliated schools but completely
different schools altogether mu is
probably going to be the school that
you're going to be more familiar with
but UMKC is where I went for five years
and the reason why I chose accounting
was because I was really good at math so
I figured why not go for accounting but
once I took a few courses I realized
there was not quite as much math in
all as I had hoped and there was more
comprehensive and analytical thinking
but I stuck with anyways and I graduated
with the degree I graduated in December
of 2009 so it's been a while since I
graduated and although I'm not currently
using my degree right now I'm still very
proud of the fact that I went to college
and that I actually graduated so to me
that is an accomplishment in and of
itself but yeah that is fact number
three I have in accounting degree so I
mentioned that I went to the University
of missouri-kansas city
and in fact number four is I'm actually
a Kansas City native as well I've lived
here my entire life I was born and
raised here in Kansas City and Kansas
City isn't the biggest city in the
entire world it's a little bit bigger
than a city like st. Louis but
definitely a lot smaller than a city
like Chicago and something a lot of
people don't really know about Kansas
City is that it actually sits on the
border of Kansas and Missouri so there's
actually a Kansas City Kansas in a
Kansas City Missouri but most of the
time when people hear Kansas City they
tend to just think of Kansas but it's
actually on the Missouri side as well
which is the side that I happen to live
on and being from Kansas City I am
naturally a Kansas City Chiefs fan I
love the Kansas City Chiefs I don't
really care about the Royals too much
most because I don't really like
baseball all that much but I am a huge
fan of the Chiefs I love the Chiefs and
yes it is tough being a Chiefs fan
because they don't have that many great
seasons but I'd like to support my
hometown team and I love them win or
lose but Kansas City is also known for
their barbecue so if you've ever been
here you'll know that there's a ton of
barbecue places around here and it's
also the city of fountains so there's
also a crap-ton of fountains as well but
the thing that I love most about Kansas
City is that it's a big enough City that
there's always something fun to do but
it's not so big that traffic is terrible
or anything like that
okay so we're finally here on to fact
number five and I actually couldn't
think of a fifth back so I decided to
just switch it up a bit and give you
guys a bunch of smaller facts about me
so my favorite superhero is this guy
right here spider-man that's my favorite
superhero
my second favorite super
hero is this guy right here Iron Man and
the Iron Man 3 movie sucked by the way
this movie wasn't too bad though
but yeah spider-man and Iron Man are my
two top favorite superheroes
I love Marvel in general Marvel I'm a
huge Marvel nerd huge Marvel geek I
remember as a kid I watched all of the
90s cartoons so spider-man Iron Man
x-men The Hulk Fantastic Four whatever
it was you name it I watched it so I'm
really big Marvel geek
DC's all right I like Batman but other
than that I don't really care for DC too
much one of the most influential artists
or celebrities whatever you want to call
him in my life is actually Michael
Jackson I'm a huge huge Michael Jackson
fan I remember as a kid I was very
obsessed with his music and his dancing
I watched him all the time on TV and I
always wanted to learn how to moonwalk
and I eventually did learn how to do it
it took me a few years
oddly enough but I still think Michael
Jackson does the best moonwalk ever and
he was also one of the reasons why I
wanted to learn how to dance I thought
he was a fantastic dancer and he always
had a way of making some of the most
simplistic moves look like the biggest
moves in the world and that was what I
thought was so special about a guy like
him besides his music and I know a lot
of people say a lot of bad things about
him but you can't deny that he's a great
artist and a great dancer and I was
actually very sad in the day that he
passed away because I'm such a huge fan
and he was so influential to me and the
things that I do with my life so huge
fan of Michael Jackson my first
cellphone ever was the Motorola V 300
and back in the day that phone was
pretty awesome
I remember being obsessed with it
because you could actually get real mp3
ringtones on it so actually real songs
versus just you know the generic
ringtones like the hello moto and all
that stuff so I remember being obsessed
with that phone and my first smartphone
ever was the mytouch 3G slide also
happens to him
first Android phone ever and if you
remember that phone or if you had that
phone that phone was a pain in the butt
to root it took hours to root it but
phones nowadays are so easy to root
because there's all these different
one-click methods and auto routes and
all that stuff so it's not really that
big of a deal now but back in the day
that phone was really hard to root and
that sort of jump-started my interest
into Android and once I got the mytouch
3G slide I sort of started jumping from
phone to phone after that because I
became so obsessed with having the
latest and greatest phone if you're a
UFC Fan if you like MMA my favorite
fighter is lyoto machida he's not really
all that good anymore but I still love
them anyways got to support that guy I
think he's pretty awesome as far as
music goes I pretty much listen to a
little bit of everything so I'm not
really picky with my music but lately
I've been on a high-energy kick so a lot
of dubstep a lot of electronica type
stuff big fan of artists like Calvin
Harris Avicii Steve Aoki Bassnectar
deadmau5 of anyone else you can think of
I've probably listened to them a big fan
of high-energy type music especially for
dancing I think it's great for that sort
of stuff but I think that is really all
that I can think of right now I don't
really have much else to say so I'm
going to end this video right here
hopefully you guys did enjoy it and hope
you guys learned a little bit about me
both inside the world of technology and
outside of it as well but thank you so
much for watching guys give it a thumbs
up if you did enjoy it
and as always keep it locked on Android

things Android

Vegas if you've ever been to Vegas
