handy the Android authority app guy and
welcome back to a very special edition
of Google Play weekly Android KitKat 4.4
was released yesterday so take a guess
what we're going to talk about this week
without further delay let's get started
the first thing we'll talk about today
is projects felt projects felt is
essentially Google's project to optimize
Android to work on older hardware by
streamlining every major component
google has reduced memory used to allow
the OS to run on Hardware with as little
as 512 megabytes of memory
this combined with project butter shows
that Google wants a quick and responsive
interface even on older hardware some
have even begun circulating the
speculation that Google is using this as
a means to end fragmentation since
pretty much all but the oldest Android
devices have at least 512 megabytes of
memory that covers pretty much everyone
it's also been reported that KitKat can
work on wearable gadgets like
smartwatches and Google glass Android
KitKat will have even better performance
in multitasking abilities than jellybean
they have upgraded their surface flinger
from OpenGL ES 1.0 to 2.0 which will
improve performance color calibration
and according to reports support for
more advanced special effects this
includes new transitions for app
developers to make their apps look even
more buttery with the aforementioned
memory optimizations this also
translates to better multitasking along
with the under the hood changes google
has also tweaked the UI new transparent
effects called immersive mode allow app
devs to cover up things like soft keys
and the status bar by making them
translucent they should solve a lot of
problems with the soft keys and status
bar taking up precious real estate also
much of the Tron blue has been removed
in favor of the off-white that we've
seen in the leaks with transparent UI
leaks this makes Android look a whole
lot brighter and that can be an
improvement for a lot of people ok now
that we have the big stuff out of the
way let's take a look at some of the
more individual features hang type there
are a bunch of them like the Moto X
Google now will always be listening just
say ok Google to open the app and search
for what you need you will not be able
to do this with the screen off like the
Moto X but once the screen is on it
should work just fine you can also
access Google now by swiping to the
right from the main home screen they
have added smarter calling which is
actually quite nice with this KitKat
will prioritize your favorite contacts
and lets you search for nearby
establishments so you can call them the
caller ID has also been
improved and the dialer will now try to
get Google Maps info on numbers that
call you that aren't in your contacts
list one of the bests new features of
KitKat will be improved NFC payments
days of requiring a secure element to
make NFC payments are coming to an end
and people will be able to use the tap
to pay feature in Google Wallet
regardless of the carrier this is done
using host card emulation that
effectively bypasses that obnoxious
secure element requirement good by Isis
you had a good run just kidding
improved printing is coming to Android
4.4 the premise for this one is simple
you can use your handset to print from
any printer that it can gain access to
according to Google it'll be any printer
connected to Google Cloud Print HPE
printers and pretty much any other
printer that has an Android app imagine
being able to sign in to your cloud
storage and accessing all the files from
one interface
guess what KitKat says yes you can with
KitKat you'll be able to access cloud
storage right along with your internal
storage whenever you need to so you
don't need to open up various apps just
to get to the files you need KitKat will
also come with the power to control your
television specifically built in support
for infrared sensors will be included so
now any OEM that wants to include an
infrared sensor can and it will work
also Wi-Fi tunnel the direct link setup
will allow KitKat to stream media to
devices that are on the same Wi-Fi
network KitKat also brings a lot of
audio and video improvements they
include Wi-Fi certified miracast support
resolution switching and apps support
for common encryption audio tunneling to
DSP to conserve battery when the screen
is off audio monitoring a loudness
enhancer for spoken content system-wide
closed captioning and enhanced music and
movie controls on the lockscreen some
new built-in functionality includes a
built-in screen recorder so you can
record video of what's happening on your
screen also built-in is a new step
detector and step counter for you
fitness buffs out there these are pretty
much self-explanatory included now our
new Bluetooth profiles that will add
support for a number of new features
including setting absolute volume on the
system from a Bluetooth device improved
keyboard joystick and mouse support and
message exchanges with nearby devices
the last two things we'll talk about our
security features and location features
app sandbox security has been improved
using security enhanced linux and
they've also included two new
cryptographic algorithms for location
features the quick settings now have two
options for high accuracy mode and
battery saving mode that will adjust
your system settings accordingly all in
all despite only going from 4.3 to 4.4
kitkat is a gigantic step forward from
jelly bean and after a couple of years
of incremental updates it's great to see
Google finally taking that big next step
forward once again i'm joe handy the
