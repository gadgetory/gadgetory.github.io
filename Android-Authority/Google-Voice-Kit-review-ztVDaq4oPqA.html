now it's been such lovely weather here I
thought I'd come out from the studio and
do my Knicks video here about the Google
Voice get out in my garden now if you
remember I did a video a little while
back about how you take a Raspberry Pi
and use the software from Google which
they have for their voice get a modify
it to use a normal speaker and a normal
USB microphone and how you could
therefore get a kind of a your own
homemade digital assistant now once I
made that video Google very kindly
contacted me and they sent me a proper
Google Voice kit now these were really
hard to get hold of - thank you very
much Google if you have a look inside
the box here here you have all the bits
the speaker the big button on the top
okay and all the other bits and I'm
going to give you this we assemble this
together and we're going to see what
else if you I know all about the Google
Voice kit please let me explain so there
are several stages to getting the boys
keep working first we need to actually
assemble the hardware then you need to
install the software then you need to
configure Google's cloud services and
then finally you need to test it now
assembling the hardware is fairly
straightforward Google give a whole
bunch of instructions over at the Google
Voice website if you get stuck at all
just look at the photographs and just
check to see that you're doing the right
thing I wouldn't consider myself a
hardware expert but I managed to get
this together fairly simply now the
software for the Google Voice kit is
provided by Google itself now all of the
links and all the actual details are
step by step because you're going to
find in the article that accompanies
this video that's over on the under
authority comm website I really
recommend you following the steps there
but in broad strokes what you need to do
is you need to download that image and
write it on to an SD card and then boot
your Raspberry Pi with of course a mouse
keyboard and monitor connected to it and
once your Roger PI boots up you will see
the fairly standard Raspberry Pi desktop
but you'll notice that the wallpaper
has been replaced by Google and while
you're now on your Raspberry Pi you're
going to need to configure access to
secure shell you do that by going to the
menu and then finding the Radford PI
configuration program so two interfaces
and then make sure that SSH is enabled
and you also need to make sure that your
network is configured go up to the Wi-Fi
sign up on the top right hand corner by
the clock and configure it your Wi-Fi
network now the reason we have your
Raspberry Pi kicks to the Internet is
because a lot of these heavy lifting is
done using Google's cloud services so to
get this Google assistant working on the
Raspberry Pi you're going to need to
connect to and configure a cloud
services account over at Google now all
the details on how you do this are found
in this article and also Google have
published them on the voice kit website
and again there are links over at the
article for that basically what you need
to is go over there you log in you
create a new project you enable the
Google assistant API for that project
you need to create some credentials for
logging in so that it knows that your
raspberry pi is authorized to log into
your account and you do that by creating
some oo-oo credentials and you then
download the JSON file which has those
credentials in and you put them on your
raspberry pi renaming the file to
assistant Jason and once you've done
that it should work with the Google's
Google's cloud services and now that you
put it all together hardware software
cloud services the only thing left to do
is to test it how many kilometers in a
mile or mile equals one point six zero
nine kilometers who is the CEO of Google
the CEO at Google is sundar Pichai
please sing me a song I'm singing you a
song because Tom some wit and salt make
you happy this is a song for you how
many ounces in a kilogram one kilogram
equals thirty five point two seven four
ounces and so there we have it the
Google Voice kit it's a great device if
you
to just play around with Google's voice
recognition services build your own
things just using a Raspberry Pi which
is really easy to get hold of if you
want to do prototyping maybe you're
actually building a proper product then
all this is just a great way of getting
into digital assistants and into voice
recognizing so really a thumbs up to
Google for making this accessible to
everybody from amateur to professional
and go Sims from Andrew authority and I
hope you enjoyed this video please do
give it a thumbs up also don't forget to
subscribe to and royalties YouTube
channel hit a notification bell and also
go with to Android 40 calm because we
are your source for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
