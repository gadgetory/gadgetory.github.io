Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to another episode of
Android apps weekly okay folks let's
jump right into some headlines first up
Google now allows developers from 12 new
countries to sell Android apps in the
Google Play Store most of those
countries are in South and Central
America along with a few others pebble
smartwatches have gained the ability to
use Android wear apps and notifications
this makes them a great alternative to
Android wear devices and even better if
you already own one Chris Cox chief
product officer at Facebook has
announced the company has officially
begun working on applications for VR we
have no idea what they'll be or what
they'll do but it's interesting
nevertheless Google helpouts released an
announcement earlier this week that says
they will be shutting down on April
twentieth 2015 this came to the surprise
of no one because no one really used the
platform xposed framework is officially
out for lollipop and root users can
officially rejoice however it is an
early build and there are some pretty
serious bugs so the inexperience should
probably wait a little bit until it gets
more stable for more headlines app
updates and a police news don't forget
to subscribe to our newsletter I curate
it myself every single week and will
never send you any spam or
ridiculousness just app news app
releases and updates straight your email
every Friday now let's take a look at
the apps that made a big splash this
last week VLC media player is releasing
an update soon to version 3.1 with it
will come some big changes the biggest
of which will be chromecast support that
means very soon chromecast users will
have a very powerful media player in
their arsenal the update isn't out yet
but it should be coming sometime soon
Monkey King escape is a new infinite
runner out of Ubisoft that features some
colorful graphics fun cartoons and of
course the always addictive infinite
runner style it's fairly run-of-the-mill
when compared to others but it's still a
great game for kids and adults who love
animals pushbullet received a huge
update this last week now on top of text
messages you can also respond to
facebook messenger whatsapp and Google
Hangouts messages on your computer this
is the update that a lot of people have
been waiting for and it really helps
augment an already strong set of
features from pushbullet draw slasher
was a popular game on the PS vita
console last week its salt an official
Android release it's an action-adventure
hack and slash game where you swipe the
screen to slash up the bad guys it's a
paid game but there are no in-app
purchases which is quite refreshing do
button by ifttt is a new application
from the same great minds that brought
us you guessed it ifttt this allows you
to create a button that does pretty much
whatever you want it to do when you
press it simply create a recipe and then
whenever you tap the button your device
will do the things you want it to do
it's also totally free once again I'm
