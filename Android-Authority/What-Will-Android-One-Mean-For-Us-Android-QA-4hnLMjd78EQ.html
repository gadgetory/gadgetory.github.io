to you by citrix gotoassist
the number one global market leader in
remote support welcome back to Android
Q&amp;amp;A you ask the questions I answer them
my name is Jase and allow me to share
with you a mind-blowing number the
amount of smartphone users in India
alone is expected to exceed more than
104 million people in this year alone
that's double from last year just think
about that 104 million in just one year
and if those aren't staggering enough
Android one is the plan to reach the
remaining 5 billion people on the planet
who don't already have a smartphone so
what is Android 1 and what does it mean
for you let's talk about that that's
right Android 1 just launched this past
week in India and if it goes as well as
Google hopes maybe the next person
sitting in this chair is going to be
some University student from Pune named
Bhavan I can hear it now we love you mr.
J's but India's dating over you see
Android 1 is trying to tackle three
challenges hardware software and
connectivity these are the three big
reasons why it's hard for people in
countries such as India Indonesia and
Philippines to get their hands on a
high-quality smartphone first is the
hardware itself even entry-level
smartphones still remain out of reach
for many bear in mind that in some of
these countries the average monthly
income is around $250 u.s. secondly many
people in these countries do not have
access to the latest Android updates and
finally even where 3G and 4G networks
are available not enough people have
phones that can support data and even
when they can those data plans are
expensive so how does Android plan on
tackling these challenges by working
closely with phone and silicon chip
makers to share reference designs and
select components Android is trying to
make it easier for partners to build
phones that are not just great to use
but also affordable they have high
quality front-facing and rear-facing
cameras they're also trying to add
features that will be especially
important for people in India like dual
SIM cards and a replaceable battery and
build
fmm radio now the burning question that
many of you will have is how fast can I
get my Android updates
well according to Google's blog to help
ensure a consistent experience Android
one devices will receive the latest
versions of Android directly from Google
so you get the latest features
up-to-date security patches and peace of
mind knowing that your stuff is always
backed up it also means Android one
devices will be some of the first to
receive the Android L release later this
year now getting down to the bottom line
just how much will these Android one
devices cost the carbon Android one
Sparkle V or Sparkle 5 is now on sale
for six thousand four hundred ninety
nine rupees or approximately one hundred
and sixteen dollars and the spice
Android one dream you know is for seven
thousand four hundred ninety nine rupees
or a hundred and thirty five dollars and
as of Monday afternoon the Micromax
Android one canvas a1 is being sold on
Amazon and is currently sold out now
before we talk about what this means for
androids hardware partners like Samsung
that already create entry-level phones
we got to thank our sponsor go to assist

got to wonder how hardware partners like
samsung are going to respond to android
1 because that is clearly a direct
competitor the two most popular phones
in india are Samsung entry-level phones
but let's be honest they suck they're
not very good at all
so what is Samsung going to do are they
going to use Android 1 and their devices
are they going to
redesign TouchWiz so it's fast and
snappy I don't know but this was
Google's response to that very concern
on Google's blog they stated for our
hardware partners they'll be able to
create customized experiences and
differentiate their devices without
having to change the core software so
we'll see but I don't think Samsung is
going to be happy so what do you guys
think do you have high hopes for Android
one if any of you have purchased one of
the Android one devices I'd love to hear
about it in the comments below tell me
what you think you can connect with me

ninja Kevin lawn and Chris all working
