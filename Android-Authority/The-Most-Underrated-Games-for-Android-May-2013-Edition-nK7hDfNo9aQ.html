handy the Android authority app guy do
you like games I know I do but sometimes
it's hard to find a good game that isn't
already mega popular after the intro
we'll show you a few of the most
underrated games for Android first on
our list is attack of the Wall Street
Titan this goofy little game focuses
around those nasty people who work at
Wall Street commonly known as the 1% and
put you in a position where you can lay
the smackdown on them without getting
into any real trouble here's how the
game works an on hacks the Wall Street
Titan and gives you control of it you
then use it to pound on annoying police
officers and rich people who are trying
to accost protesters and such it's
really easy to play but it can get
annoying if you don't first turn off the
pop-ups that explain what every single
powerup does Cardinal Quest is
old-school how old-school is it you can
see the checkerboard tiles on the map
which is something you don't see often
since the days of the SNES it's a
dungeon crawling RPG with fantastically
simple controls and an easygoing
attitude simply put all you need to do
is tap tap in whatever direction you
want to move in and tap whatever
direction you want to attack and boom
that's the whole game you can access
your inventory and a map to help things
along but this games biggest strength is
how simple it is to play edge extent it
is all about shapes namely cubes and how
you use them to move around levels and
puzzles to reach the end if you're
looking for something complex and
time-consuming look elsewhere friends as
this is definitely one of those games
you play a round or two while you're on
the crapper you slide your finger across
the screen and it moves the cube
accordingly you can climb some walls
avoid traps trigger events and even ride
on the shoulders of a giant polygon
robot
despite the simple controls there are
parts where it gets rather complicated
especially if you're a perfectionist
when oil rush was announced it was a
game that many people looked forward to
since it was released it's kind of
fallen off the media radar and that
makes us sad pandas unlike the last item
on our list if you want something
complex and time-consuming then oil rush
is more your speed it's a real-time
strategy game and thus plays like a real
time strategy game you collect resources
you build an upgrade your stuff and
attack your enemies the graphics in this
game are gorgeous one of the best in all
of Android now for the bad news it's
only compatible with Snapdragon
processors sorry X and O's and
fans fans of games like temple run will
get a kick out of our next game called
one epic night this is because the
mechanics and gameplay are pretty much
identical one epic night is a runner
game that's pretty great if you love
Temple Run but really want to play
something that isn't Temple Run you can
switch lanes jump slide collect items
and use items in one epic night item use
includes things like swords and shields
which can be used to defeat enemies and
break traps you can also collect coins
which then can be used to purchase
power-ups last on our list is pixel
towers this game focuses around the
ability to place a block in the exact
same place over and over and over again
for all eternity there is only one thing
to control and that's when the blocks
drop so if you hate complicated controls
you'll probably love this it's
definitely a fun game that's only fun
for about 10 or 15 minutes at a time
like when you're waiting in line for
that thing that you like it can get
pretty difficult as well especially when
things speed up a little bit it's so
simple that I've literally run out of
things to say about it except that it
can be fun if you take a look at our
leaderboard you can see how all these
underrated games compare to one another
once again you guys rated these not us
and there is no bias on our parts if you
want to check these games out we put the
app links in the video description of
course there are thousands upon
thousands of great games in the Google
Play Store that don't get the attention
they probably deserve so if there's an
underrated game you want to talk about
there's a comment section below that we
encourage you to use once again I'm Joe
