less than two weeks and this is what I
want to see people requested it and the
rumours attested the one plus three is
said to bring back NFC the Chinese
startup decided to get rid of the NFC
chip from last year's flagship
apparently due to lack of use now let's
talk about improving that camera 1 plus
had a bad camera year in 2015 so we're
hoping things will look better literally
the one plus ax had a very inconsistent
camera while the one plus 2's camera app
struggled more than we would have liked
so what will be in store for one plus is
3 camera for now all we know is that it
will have a 16 megapixel main shooter of
course that doesn't tell us very much
other than the fact that they did some
changes to the camera technology last
year's flagship had a 13 megapixel
sensor but of course those megapixels
don't really mean that much we're also
hoping for quicker software updates
despite the fact that Android
marshmallow has been available to OEMs
for seven months now the oneplus 2 is
still running lollipop the company
promised marshmallow would come to the
device by the end of March but now we're
in June and the software is still in
beta now it can be a little bit
forgiving here because software updates
are huge undertakings even for big
manufacturers and we understand that one
plus is still a small start-up now who
wants fast charging despite having a
processor that supports quick charge 2.0
1 plus 2 never took advantage of this in
fact none of one pluses products have
ever come with quick charge support
which is unfortunate it's becoming a
somewhat frustrating things for users as
devices tend to come with large
batteries the oneplus one had a three
thousand one hundred million power
battery weather 1 plus two had a 3300
billion power battery it takes a while
to charge those without some help now
let's talk about that operating system
one of the most interesting parts of one
plus was it software it was launched
running cyanogen the deal between one
plus and the rom developer then ended
and now the chinese startup is using its
own oxygen OS now we know that many of
you love cyanogen and we're very sad to
see this change happen but having
another UI is not really the problem
after all oxygen OS
is a clean and simple interface that's
very close to stock Android the problem
is that despite its light nature oxygen
OS just has so many bugs so what do you
guys want to see in the one plus three
let me know in the comments below I'll
be sure to read them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
