high marks for a nice offering in the
flagship zenfone 2 but now AT&amp;amp;T has been
able to procure a entry level version of
the phone made for prepaid go phone
customers with such a lower price point
in matching specifications how does this
budget-minded zenfone fare it's Josh
with a car from Android authority what's
going on everybody
and this is the assuit then phone 2e
despite a smaller size the zenfone 2e
retains much of the design language
started by its flagship brethren the
power button is up top which might feel
a little weird to season two Android
users who are used to having it on the
side but considering the smaller overall
size of the 2e it isn't really that hard
to reach the vine rocker is on the back
not quite akin to the way LG does it but
the index finger still lands easily on
the buttons and though the rocker feels
a little squishier than we would have
liked there have been no issues with
input throughout usage even the front
buttons are all capacitive with a small
brushed area underneath them providing a
little extra texture to the phone's look
a really nice feature of this phone is
the inclusion of a replaceable back
cover though this edition originally
came in why it's simply popping off the
backing and replacing it with the black
cover was easy and underneath the cover
is where the slots for SIM and microSD
cards can be put though we never found
the 5.5 inch zenfone 2 to be too
cumbersome with its screen shedding half
an inch obviously helps the 2e in the
handling department the curve on the
back of the phone also helps as it sits
really well and helps angle the phone
for side-to-side operations it's
probably best to call these n phone 2e a
pretty Spartan device because aside from
the button layout you don't really get
too many bells and whistles on this
phone otherwise for a go phone however
you still get some of the good looks
that the design language of a Seuss's
best phones can provide with the smaller
display comes a smaller resolution but
for the very casual user the zenfone 2e
should suffice
this 5-inch display comes in at 720p
resolution lower than the full HD
performer of the original but it makes
sense considering the price of this go
phone 294 pixels per inch lower the
amount of sharpness for text reading but
it isn't the worst performer that we've
seen that said we definitely noticed a
change in overall quality and this
screen compared to full and quad HD
screens but it's nothing to fault this
budget device over viewing angles happen
to be pretty good and the general color
temperature tends to be on the warmer
side but this can be changed with a
built-in screen color mode selector
where modes can be selected or the user
can customize the temperature text
noticeably loses a bit of sharpness with
the drop in resolution making this a
simply decent performer in the scope of
the total market colors remains pretty
good and brightness benefits from the
IPS construction making media
consumption still enjoyable for the user
that isn't really looking for the most
clarity or the highest resolution so as
a budget go phone having 720p resolution
in its screen is pretty standard making
the zenfone 2e the kind of performer
that the frugal user expects and the
same can be said for performance made
possible by the Intel Atom Z 2560 a big
step down from the Intel processor that
was found in the original zenfone 2 this
dual core processor pumping 1.6
gigahertz is backed by power VR graphics
and 1 gigabytes of RAM though the
processor package will bear some of the
blame for the performance it's clear
that even casual users will find some
frustration with mainly the 1 gigabyte
of RAM of which can be used are pretty
easily
causing slowdown even in the home
screens there is a measure of stutter
observed and then there are delays
loading most applications it shouldn't
be expected that intensive apps like
high-end games would work all that well
on here but even for a
middle-of-the-road game like combo
croute to crash consistently is a bit
disheartening and for that reason we
don't really see the zenfone 2e working
on a very consistent basis for the
casual gamer for games that are any
higher than let's say candy crush simple
point-and-click games for the most parts
honestly you can try the games that you
want on this phone but your mileage may
simply vary so it's not surprising that
app cleaners are prominently shown in
the recent apps screen and in the
notification drop-down they are there to
show you that there are some limits to
what this phone's processing power can
handle and the same can be said for the
internal storage of which there is a sub
standard 8 gigabytes after installing a
couple of games and then streaming some
music on Spotify and filling up the
cache with them the space was already
used up luckily a micro SD card slot is
available with expansion of up to 64
gigabytes possible so media and
especially pictures can be put on there
for better keeping
connections and phone call quality are
obviously dependent on the AT&amp;amp;T network
phone calls came in quite clear and we
experienced no drops in the 4G LTE
network managed to be pretty reliable no
matter where I went in my part of
Southern California and nearly all
connections are found here with the
exception of NFC the rear-facing speaker
is a pretty standard fare with somewhat
tinny noise that doesn't get too loud
and lacks in mostly the lower middle to
lower ends and finally in the battery
2500 milliamp hours in the unit performs
just about as well as it should on a
typical day
it isn't a particularly large battery
but with the lower resolution in the
screen and the lower specifications
especially when compared to even other
phones in its price brackets you could
pretty much get more than a day's worth
from the zenfone 2e especially if you
use the optimized power modes the
following Geekbench battery test was
used in the optimized power saving mode
which is the default and seemed to do a
pretty good job of keeping the on screen
time from tumbling down but with heavier
usage for things like GPS tracking and
also music streaming I had to reach for
an external battery before the end of
the day so it's not a terrible performer
but the user will have to cater usage to
make the phone last longer for them and
in camera and eight megapixel shooter
provides some extra modes you might not
expect from an entry-level smartphone
HDR a miniature mode and even a smart
removal mode are all available video
modes include time-lapse at 1080p
resolution and for selfies 2 megapixel
pictures are possible in the
front-facing camera though the dedicated
selfie mode was pretty great to use
using user defined face detection the
rear facing camera will snap three
photos based on how many faces it finds
this was a pretty good mode to use and
it would be good for anyone that wants a
better selfie from this phone
unfortunately picture quality all around
is expectedly very low as proportional
to the very low price point as they can
get sharpness was really low only made
much worse when zooming in and colors
are quite muted with brighter parts of
pictures typically getting blown out HDR
does tend to be a better choice in most
situations as it lowers exposure a bit
on those blown out areas but more
importantly adds a healthy amount of
saturation Zahl colors what probably
hurts the experience most is the slower
speed of capture as a solid delay from
shutter button
the file is always observed not to
mention the slower shutter speed that
often adds blur to the already lower
sharpness photos and video showed these
same problems especially blowing out
highlights and in showcasing that
shutter speed that results in higher
stutter throughout for capturing the
moment the zenfone 2e camera tries to be
a good companion but quality remains
proportional to the low price that this
phone comes at and finally in software
the Zen UI brings a generally
oversaturated interface to this
budget-minded device providing a lot of
features that the casual user might not
really take advantage of there are the
different customization apps like the
screen color Tweaker and a bunch of
tools including even a do it later
tasking camp customizations continue
with plenty of options for the home
screens including even icon packs
different animations for scrolling and
smart grouping of applications and the
app screens all of this is on top of
Android 5.0.1 lollipop build so material
design elements are given a much more
colorful and somewhat cartoony feel this
can also be somewhat due to the 720p
display which can make items look a
little more bloated than usually found
on high resolution screens but what
strikes us most about the Zen UI is that
it tries to provide a lot of options no
matter where you are on the interface
but with lower specifications and only
one gigabyte of RAM it might not make as
much sense because it can only really
run so much before slowing down as we
keep saying the highly casual user will
probably find the zenfone 2e as a decent
overall performer but going the extra
mile is really not what this budget
GoPhone was made for at a grade two one
1999 the price is definitely the rub for
the zenfone 2e making this one of the
easiest entry points into the world of
Android not too many smart phones come
at such a low price points as commonly
considered budget phones include things
like the Moto G in the Moto e the Moto G
of which is usually about $50 more out
of pocket which is why it's pretty easy
to just consider the zenfone 2e as let's
say a starter smartphone for the casual
user looking to get into smartphones for
very little money it's pretty easy to
criticize a soos for not really going
the extra mile in the zenfone 2e even
when you compare it to its other
original zenfone 2 and if you look at it
in comparison to the entire smartphone
market but really that's not the point
of the zenfone 2e rather these zenfone 2
is for the user that needs the cheapest
way to experience a smartphone without
breaking the bank they just have to
temper their expectations for usage on
the daily it might be for the super
casual gamer the occasional media
streamer and the user that needs are
straight-up cellphone with some
smartphone capabilities so this is one
of the cheapest ways to get to all of
those places but really you get what you
pay for as always thank you guys very
much for watching and I hope you enjoyed
this review of the Ascend phone - it is
a go phone under the AT&amp;amp;T carrier here
in the US and as such it is coming in at
a $120 price point which makes it one of
the easiest entry points into the
Android smartphone world is it a great
phone when you especially when you
compare it to the rest of the market
probably not I don't really give it very
high marks in any one particular
category but then again when considering
this super casual user who is actually
going to just use this phone for calls
texting and maybe the occasional media
consumption then this phone could be a
decent performer on the daily but there
are some other devices that might be
even better than this one that you can
get for an unlocked price that's not too
far off from the go phone price of this
so keep it tuned to Android authority
for even more about the rest of the
devices especially budget ones we have
plenty of reviews here at the Android
authority channel for you to take a look

bit of money then take a look at all of
