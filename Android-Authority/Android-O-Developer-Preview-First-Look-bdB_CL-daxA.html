hindi from android authority comm and
google just flipped our world upside
down with their developer preview
release of android Oh so let's take a
look alright folks so let's start with
the visual tweaks on the surface not
much is different the home screens app
drawer Google now the quick settings and
toggles and all that jazz is pretty much
about the same I have a nexus 5 so I
don't have the pixel launcher I imagine
those are the pixel probably do
nevertheless it looks like Android oh is
going to be the fourth version of
Android in the material design era
things are not as they seem though the
notifications look the same but they now
include a new features you'll be able to
silence notifications for an individual
application for 15 30 or 60 minutes
unlike the Do Not Disturb mode which
silences everything with a few
exceptions
this one only silences notifications for
that one app the biggest changes come
into settings and oh boy did they change
a whole bunch the front page of the
Settings app is far more simplified than
prior versions of Android a lot of the
settings such as the keyboard developer
options and others now rest inside one
of these new categories similarly things
like the lockscreen and the security
have been bundled together to save space
there is one notable exception to this
new rule originally Bluetooth and NFC
choose to live in the network settings
now these have their own little section
called connected devices and the cast
option is now also there unlike a nougat
there is no side drawer that pops out
anymore but these system search does
still work also the developer options
and the system UI tuner are still
accessible the exact same way as they've
always been
they just now show up under the system
section instead of right there on the
main settings menu things look a lot
different but most of it still works the
same way it's just a matter of finding
your way around now let's move on to
some of the new features ok these are
things that you should be able to sink
your teeth into right now unfortunately
there is a lot more plan than there is
actually available but we'll quickly
glance over the stuff that you can play
with right this very second oh and just
real quick before we get into the rest
of the stuff here we're just going to
mention really quick the status bar now
shows more things it's not really a big
deal at all but it's there and it's my
job to mention it like most of the
features and testing a lot of what
you'll find is in the system UI tuner
and the developer options for starters
you'll be able to define shortcuts on
the lockscreen yourself that means you
can have it open to your phone in your
camera like it used to do or something
like your favorite game and the gallery
app or whatever the choice is completely
yours also when the system UI tuner is
the ability to change the layout of the
navigation keys you can add buttons and
actually move the buttons to the left or
the right side or even compress them in
the center if you want to I'm no expert
but I'm going to wager a guess here and
say that this is for larger devices to
make one-handed use a little easier I
could be wrong though in the developer
settings you'll be able to access all of
the new Bluetooth codecs at Android Oh
will support they include a PTX aptX HD
and Sony's LD HD you can configure
little things like sampling rain and
some other stuff although most of it is
for the LD AC it doesn't matter which
one you use because it all sounds better
than the crap we have right now you'll
also be able to access native support
for homescreen badges for those who
don't know those are the little numbers
by the icons that show you if there's
something in the app for you they're
accessible in the application section of
the settings menu ok folks this one's
just a little bit complicated Android au
has changed how you install things from
unknown sources previously you could
just take a box in the settings and then
you're good to go
now you have to manually give permission
to the application you downloaded the
apk from in order to do it for example
if you download an apk over Google
Chrome you'll have to grant Google
Chrome permission before you can install
the file it's a little thing but it
definitely helps with security there are
a couple of things that I was unable to
test myself apparently there is the
option to change your device theme the
option rests under the display settings
but as you can see here my Nexus 5x just
doesn't have it this is most likely for
pixel owners to check out and right now
it's essentially just a light theme and
a dark theme like we've seen in years
past oh and applications now have
something called notification channels
for instance Facebook could have a
notification channel for just likes and
then a notification channel for just
comment if it wants to you can now
control those however applications
actually don't use this yet so you
really can't play with it finally we
will now mourn the passing of a feature
that has been removed you can no longer
add the battery percentage to the icon
and that acts
it kind of sucks because I've always
used it just like Android nougat some of
the best stuff is chilling out under the
hood I'm going to round all these up
really quick because they're either
there and you can't see them or they
have been announced and not yet added
hold on to your seats because this is
going to go quick the big new feature is
a new method of controlling background
processes without getting too far into
it applications won't have nearly the
freedom that they used to have when
running in the background applications
will have to rely on the job scheduler
to get things done instead of doing
their own thing you hear that Facebook
recess is over you battery sucking
bastard Android Oh we'll also have
adaptive icons that's really just fancy
talk for many different icons so it can
be shown as a square or a circle or
triangle or whatever without looking
messed up picture-in-picture is a
feature that showed up on select Android
devices in Android nougat starting an o
every device will be able to use it
however application developers will have
to be the ones that add support before
it can be used Android o will also
feature better support for hardware
keyboards finally there is a new
autofill API that will let password
manager applications more easily fill in
things like the email or password when
logging into apps in other words
LastPass is going to work a lot better
it will also support a wider color gamut
it was noted that this is not native HDR
support but rather just more colors
active delivers will now be able to use
whatever font they want in their
application instead of whatever the
phone says this is either going to rock
or it's royally going to suck
you'll also find support for
neighborhood aware network mode on Wi-Fi
this will let your device communicate
with nearby Wi-Fi devices without
actually being connected to a Wi-Fi
network webview multiprocessing is now
officially a thing in Android oh don't
worry about it though because you'll
probably never actually use it finally
it was reported that there have been
many optimizations made to the Android
runtime or art essentially apps will run
faster and better okay it's time to
throw in the towel and call it a video
there have been maybe one or two small
things that I forgot but that's ok
because my buddy is over Android
Authority comm are doing a whole series
on Android called diving into Android oh
I have that linked up in the video
description below and you should totally
check it out if you want to learn more
about any of these features I am going
to address one final question that I
know I'm going to get asked is it okay
to use this
a daily driver hell no the Google
developers have expressly stated that
this is nowhere near stable enough to be
run as a daily driver
additionally if you're on the Android
beta like me Google is going to try like
hell to get you to roll back to Android
seven point one point two where we all
apparently belong unless you're
tech-savvy and don't mind a bunch of
problems we don't recommend this one
just yet and that about does it for this
one folks don't forget to subscribe and
ring the bell to get the latest android
news to review videos as soon as we
release them check out that diving into
android o series because they worked a
hell of a lot harder on that then I did
on this video as always thank you for
watching everybody and have a wonderful
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
