authority and the galaxy s7 and s7 edge
have been out on the market for quite
some time now and if you're still having
a hard time making a decision on which
one to buy we're going to put these two
phones head-to-head and help you decide
this is the Samsung Galaxy s7 versus the
s7 edge alright so before we get into
this comparison I just want to quickly
throw out a disclaimer I'm gonna
approach this one a little bit
differently than your usual comparison
so because they share so many
similarities and a few differences I'm
gonna break this into two categories I'm
going to talk about the similarities and
then I'm going to talk about the
differences between these two phones so
let's go ahead and start with the
similarities so a lot of the
similarities between these two phones
will lie within the actual hardware and
internal specs so they're both being
powered by the Snapdragon 820 Adreno 530
and 4 gigabytes of RAM they also both
have micro SD card expansion which is a
feature that Samsung brought back this
year so if you love expandable storage
you have that option again with the s7
and s7 edge another feature that Samsung
brought back is water and dust
resistance II so they're both IP 68
which means you can dunk them in a
toilet I use them in the middle of a
rainstorm and they should be perfectly
fine they also both have fingerprint
sensors embedded in the home button up
front and the fingerprint sensor works
extremely well it's very fast very
accurate so you really shouldn't have
any problems at all with this
fingerprint sensor another feature that
these two phones share is on the back
and that is the camera so it's a new and
improved 12 megapixel sensor with f 1.7
aperture and optical image stabilization
it's also utilizing dual pixel auto
focusing technology which creates for
really fast auto focusing and it is by
far the fastest auto focusing system
I've ever used on any smartphone it is
seriously that
fast as far as actual image quality goes
if you don't already know the s7 takes
absolutely incredible looking images and
pretty much all lighting conditions yes
it does have the tendency to over
sharpen a little bit but for the most
part the images do look really really
good and it's not really going to matter
whether you're a hardcore smartphone
photographer or just the casual user
you're gonna be able to get some really
good looking shots with this camera now
let's go ahead and talk about what makes
these phones different and some of these
differences are naturally going to have
some similarities as well but I went
ahead and categorize them as differences
and you'll sort of understand why as I
go through and talk about them so the
first difference that I want to talk
about is the design so they're both made
of glass and metal which means they're
very high quality very solid feeling
smartphones but this also means that
they're slippery in the hand and also
fingerprint magnets and that's sort of
to be expected when you're dealing with
a phone that is predominantly made of
glass now the biggest difference here is
the actual size of these two phones and
the slight design difference with the s7
edge the s7 edge is a slightly bigger
phone than the s7 due to the bigger
display so if you want a phone that's
easier to use in one hand you're going
to want to gravitate towards the regular
s7 but if you want a phone with a bigger
display and that curved edge glass then
you're gonna want to lean more towards
the s7 edge both of them do feel very
comfortable in the hand but again the s7
is the easier phone to operate if you
care about one-handed usability now that
brings me to my next topic and that is
the display so the s7 has a 5.1 inch
screen whereas the s7 Edge has a 5.5
inch screen both are quad HD and both
are Super AMOLED so you're getting those
vibrant saturated colors those inky deep
blacks and those high contrast ratios
the main difference here is the extra
screen real estate that you get on the
s7 edge which means you're going to get
a much better viewing experience when it
comes to things like YouTube watching
movies and playing games the s7 edge
also has that curved glass which brings
some extra functionality but I'll talk a
little bit more about that when I talk
about the software the next big
difference between these two phones is
in battery life so the s7
as a 3000 milliamp hour battery whereas
the s7 Edge has a 3600 milliamp hour
battery and if you want a battery life
warrior you're going to want to go with
the s7 edge it easily lasts a full day
and sometimes a day and a half depending
on how you use it now the regular s7
gets pretty good battery life too but
just keep in mind it's not going to be
anywhere near as good or lasts anywhere
near as long as the s7 edge naturally
because it has a smaller battery now
both of these phones do have wireless
charging and fast charging so you can
take advantage of those features on
either one of these phones but if you
really want the best battery life
possible and battery life is of utmost
importance to you then you're going to
want to go with the s7 edge alright so
let's talk a little bit about the
software and again I'm not going to dive
too deep into all this because if you
want to know more about these two phones
you can check out the individual reviews
which will be linked down below but
they're both running on Android 6.0
marshmallow with Samsung's TouchWiz or
whatever Samsung is calling their
interface these days so the overall
experience between these two phones is
going to be pretty much identical for
the most part you have a lot of the same
features like multi window and palm
swipe to capture and all the other
motion gesture features and then you
have a lot of the same applications like
s voice and s planner and then the icons
look extremely cartoony and bright but
you do have the option to theme them
with Samsung's theme store and change it
to whatever you want it to look like or
even make it look a little bit more like
stock Android now where these two phones
differ in the software is in the edge
features that you get with the s7 edge
so you have things like the apps edge
the people edge the task edge and the
variety of different edge panels that
can show you information such as stocks
sports scores and the weather and I will
admit that these features do take a
little bit of getting used to but once
you do make that adjustment and get used
to them they can actually be pretty
useful the final difference and probably
the biggest difference between these two
phones is the price so the s7 edge cost
an extra hundred dollars would be
regular s7 and you're basically going to
have to ask yourself if those extra
features like a bigger display the
bigger battery and the
functionality is worth that extra
hundred dollars and for some people it
totally will be worth it and for some
people it may not be worth that at all
and for some people the price may not
even really be a factor they just want
the regular s7 because it's a little bit
smaller and it fits better in the hand
so there's a lot of different factors
that come into play when it comes to
picking between the s7 and s7 edge and
it all comes down to what you really
want out of a smartphone but hopefully
this video helped you make a decision
between these two phones and hopefully
