forthcoming with its software updates
but the company has taken a different
approach with marshmallow by opening the
public beta for customers to test after
a few days with the update what's new
and how does it impact on the galaxy s6
i'm neuro for android authority and
you're watching our galaxy s6
marshmallow run-through so let's get
right into it like most phones
I found the galaxy s6 to be great at
launch before it began to slow and show
signs of struggling and lag after just a
few months the biggest difference with
the marshmallow update has to be the
performance with the handset appearing
to be much smoother then it was running
lollipop our launch naturally though the
fonts may change after a while of use
the initial experience is definitely
positive throughout the update Samsung
seems to have made an attempt to adopt
material design with varying degrees of
success while the flatter icons and a
consistent UI language between
third-party Google and Samsung Apps are
definitely impressive there are some
changes that quite garish and completely
unnecessary
as a longtime Galaxy user the two
biggest changes are also my pet hates
with this update the first is that the
UI is now overly white even things like
the notification menu which were
absolutely fine on lollipop the second
is that Samsung has brought back the
dreaded squirrels and the white
background to the icons on the home
screen reminds me of only versions of
Huawei's Mui it's completely unnecessary
and to be honest it looks downright ugly
the notification menu has also had some
welcome improvements not least with
Samson allowing you to swipe down to
access all the quick settings you can
also scroll the initial quick settings
bar like you could in lollipop so this
should appease most users at the bottom
of the notification drop-down is a
shortcut to notification settings where
you can now turn off or turn on
notifications for individual apps it's
not all great though as you can't remove
quick connect and the wasted space does
get quite annoying the marshmallow
update also signals a closer partnership
between Google and Samsung
and this has likely been one of the
factors behind the updated UX one of the
biggest new features in the update is
now on tap which works to bring
information to your fingertips that is
related to whatever's on the display at
the time from first use now on tap
certainly works well enough and it's
nice to see that Samsung hasn't tried to
replace it with some creation of its own
like it has done with other Google
services the camera has also been
updated in marshmallow and finally you
can now shoot in wolf format using a
Galaxy S six in the latest android 5.1.1
update the raw option was greyed out so
it's good to see that something is
finally enabled a feature that many
people have asked for alongside the
changes in the camera the marshmallow
update also brings with it doze mode
which is meant to offer significant
standby time improvements from the past
few days I can safely say that while it
does improve the standby time it's not
to the level of something like the Nexus
6p and you can probably expect two to
three stack based and buy time from a
single charge of the galaxy s6 and there
you have it guys a really quick
run-through of 10 features 7 good and 3
not-so-good
of Samsung's upcoming marshmallow update
for the galaxy s6 it's not perfect which
UX is after all but the positives do
outweigh their not-so-good bits and
overall the galaxy s6 is a better device
running marshmallow then it was running
lollipop what do you think of the
marshmallow update and do you want it on
your galaxy s6
