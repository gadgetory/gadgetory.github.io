handy the Android authority app guy HD
widgets version 4 was released recently
along with a new update to color form as
well as a new theme called Cairo in this
review we're gonna check them out ok so
what is HD widgets HD widgets is an
application that provides you with a
number of clock weather indicator toggle
and other widgets that you can adorn
your home screens with it's one of the
most popular and consistent widget
packages in the history of Android and
it's only getting better it provides a
number of widgets and various sizes that
you can customize a whole bunch with the
release of version 4 comes a lot of new
features most notable are a few new
widgets such as the 7 and 10 day
forecast widgets location-based widgets
single column widgets and a smart
weather stat widget that is now
available there is also a new interface
with sidebar navigation as well as an
hourly bar graph for your weather if you
choose to use it along with version 4
came an update to the color form add-on
it's mostly things to make it compatible
with HD widgets version 4 if you're not
familiar with color form it is a theme
pack that contains a lot more bright
colors to give you more options for your
widgets also new with the HD widgets
version 4.0 release is their new Cairo
theme this is a flat and minimal theme
to help augment the KitKat experience
you can apply the Cairo theme to over 60
widgets across HD widgets and with it
comes a huge array of colors and
potential options it was specifically
designed for the new widgets that came
with version 4 although it does work
with most of the widgets that are
already present as well in short HD
widgets version 4 is a huge step up from
what it used to be it has always been
arguably one of the best widget packs of
all time and with the version 4 released
the color form update and the Cairo
launch it's added hundreds of new
options and they all look really good
it's hard to judge the design of HD
widgets because you can make the widgets
look pretty much how you want them to
they come in a plethora of sizes from
one by one to gigantic tablet sizes if
you need those to use color form in
Cairo after you purchase them of course
you can use the button at the top to
access them most widgets have color form
and Kiro support color form has been
around for a while and it's nice to see
it get updated as well it definitely
adds some unique and very colorful
options for those who prefer their
experience to be a little bit brighter
Cairo packs a lot of that same
but with everything flattened out you
can give your widgets a more
sophisticated minimal look that works
really well with existing KitKat theme
elements the app that comes along with
the widgets has changed as well it used
to be a solid weather app that showed
you some good information and it was
clean with the update HD widget sees a
UI change that conforms better to the
Android design standard as it now
contains a pull up menu from the left
side for the most part it's essentially
rearranging the old information you can
still collect weather from weather bug
AccuWeather and Weather Underground but
it actually displays more weather data
than it used to you can get weather
alerts in the widgets now and there is
now a graph available that shows the
weather on an hourly basis we really
like that ok so here's what we liked
this update was huge longtime HD widget
fans have a lot of new stuff to look at
even without the add-ons new widgets new
functionality and improvements with
stuff like battery life and performance
are all included with the update color
form also got a huge update and allows
it to work with all new widgets from
version 4 Kairo XP got released and it's
a gorgeous themed set the flattened
minimal theme adds an element that HD
widgets was kind of missing for a long
time and people interested in a more
modern theme should definitely give it a
look among my favorite new features are
the UI changes the Android design
standard makes it easier to move around
and the added UI stuff like the one-hour
weather graph actually made me uninstall
my other weather app because I really
didn't need it anymore
the addition of location-based widgets
and smart weather widgets makes the
experience more in-depth than it used to
be something else I really liked is that
if you're not sure if you want to buy
the Kairo XP or the color form XP
add-ons there are free versions
available that you can use they have
fewer themes but it gives you a good
idea of what's what and lets you see how
they work
lastly using HD widgets you can make a
widget that fits with pretty much any
theme and that's always a good thing
one thing about using a custom launcher
or a custom ROM is finding stuff to put
on your homescreen that fits with the
new aesthetic with HD widgets you no
longer have that problem and here is the
bat with the update HD widgets is
compatible with android 4.0.3 and up
only if you are a longtime HD widgets
fan and you're one of those people who
have a version of Android that is older
than that it doesn't work anymore and
while I know there aren't many of those
people left it still sucks for those
people as with any release there are a
few bugs that people are report
every now and then someone has a widget
disappear but that's something that
happens with android kitkat and really
isn't HD widgets fault but since it is a
widget application it's something that
people who use HD widgets will have to
deal with there is a little lag on older
devices and a couple of other very minor
things that don't seem to be frequent
enough but it's still there overall if
you like widgets HD widgets is what you
want to get it has a bunch of sizes in a
bunch of colors and styles and they
perform a bunch of different tasks
personally I've been using HD widgets
for years and it's usually among the
first apps I installed when I get a new
phone if you've been watching my review
videos for a while you know I don't say
that very often
Kairo and color form do a phenomenal job
to augment an already solid experience
between those two themes and the stock
themes you should have no problems
finding exactly what kind of widget
you're looking for yes there is a
problem here and there but you can't
name an application that doesn't so in
the grand scheme of things HD widgets is
a serious win and if you're into widgets
you should definitely give this a shot
