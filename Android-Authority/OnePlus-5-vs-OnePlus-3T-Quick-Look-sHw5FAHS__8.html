we're getting the opportunity to see how
it fares against the competition even in
its own camp the one plus 3t is still a
solid phone especially in terms of
design and performance so how does the
new flagship compare against its
predecessor is it worth the upgrade
well it's Joshua for Gaara what's going
on everybody and this is a quick look at
the 1 + 5 vs. the 1 + 3 T both the 1 + 5
and a 3 T feature full metal unibody
construction and some design and
hardware elements remain the same the 1
+ 5 retains the popular alert slider
found on either of the 1 plus devices
and the fingerprint sensor remains on
the front moving around to the back
you'll notice that the 1 + 5 is actually
cleaner than its predecessor with
antenna lines that blend in and the
camera now of the dual sensor variety
move to the top left corner we do see
where the 1 + 5 may have gotten some
cues from its iOS competitor and also it
does look a little bit similar to the
recently announced opal or 11 regardless
of how you feel about that there's no
denying that this is a sleek smartphone
that looks and feels great in the hand
and of course the same was also true
about the 3 T in terms of size and
handling the 1 + 5 is only a hair
shorter thinner and narrower than the 3t
and handily experience it's pretty much
the same with both both devices come
with the 5.5 inch AMOLED display with a
full HD resolution and the more standard
16 to 9 aspect ratio 1080p more than
gets the job done but we will admit that
the jump to quad HD could have put it
even more on par with the competition
that said however a couple of features
on the oneplus 5 display are pretty nice
to use including the Reading Mode which
desaturates the display so that it makes
it easier to read things kind of like on
a Kindle where the oneplus 5 does stand
out against the competition is what lies
under the hood you get the Qualcomm
Snapdragon 830 5 + 6 or 8 gigabytes of
RAM which is more than what you get with
most current generation flagships you
can choose between 64 and 128 gigabyte
storage options but there's still no
room for microSD card support now as far
as battery goes the oneplus 5 comes with
a slightly smaller 3300 milliamp hour
battery compared to the 34 hundred
million power unit in the 3t but battery
life was pretty excellent with the
latter so the oneplus 5 should still be
a pretty good powerhouse thanks to its
power efficient Snapdragon 835
- 16 megapixel rear camera of the one
plus 3t proved to be a good and reliable
shooter but one plus is stepping up the
camera game further with the one plus
five getting a dual lens setup with 16
megapixel and 20 megapixel sensors that
also has a 2x telephoto zoom up front
both phones come with the same 16
megapixel front facing shooter that will
help you capture some high quality
selfies the main story here is that the
oneplus 5 brings zoom to the Android
masses and it is definitely a step up in
terms of capabilities from the 1 plus 3t
and on the software front both feature
the same software package especially if
you got the update for the 3t oxygen OS
based on Android nougat there are a few
new features they're doing on a 1+5
including the reading mode that we said
earlier but also there is an automatic
night mode expanded screen shots and a
do not disturb mode while gaming so that
gives you a quick look at the 1 plus 5
and the 1 plus 3 T mainly on paper
they're of course going to be some new
updates to the 1 plus 5 that might make
it enticing for you to upgrade from your
3t however the one plus 3t is still a
great phone and is still quite reliable
especially if you've kept yours in
pretty good shape
the oneplus 5 may not be as aggressively
priced as the 3t one it was released but
with the starting price of four hundred
and seventy nine dollars the oneplus 5
certainly gives you a lot for your money
you might be thinking that the oneplus 5
isn't a huge upgrade and that might be
true in a few different areas but if you
are in need of a camera upgrade then the
one plus 5 is definitely one to consider
for obvious reasons keep it tuned to
andrew authority for even more about the
1 plus 5 we have stuff coming all week
and you can keep it tuned here for that
and even more because we are your source
