for the full review of the LG g5 we
thought we would take a look at it
against one of its main competitors so
as to give you guys a taste of what's to
come in the full review its charged with
regard from Android thority what's going
on everybody and this is the LG g5
versus the iPhone 6s now as has been the
case leading up to the full review which
is coming in a few days I will have to
tell you that this LG g5 is a
pre-production unit and as such some of
the stuff that you will hear in this
versus may change when the full retail
unit comes and even then we're just
going to be taking a look at a general
comparison between these two phones
design is of course a mainstay when it
comes to an Apple iPhone and the 6s
continues the tradition of having a
metal unibody and yet the 6s looks very
much like the original six you still get
all of the same bits and pieces all
around and if you get the 6s plus it is
obviously going to have a much larger
body but you still have the home button
up front with the silenced toggle over
in the corner and it is pretty easy to
use in one hand due to its smaller size
but LG was the one that really went for
a new design and this time around it
looks radically different from previous
phones like the g4 and the G flex line
this time around the curve is gone and
you have a subtle curve at the top of
the phone which is supposed to make it
easier to talk when you are on a call
but the rest of the phone still has
maybe just a couple of tropes from
previous devices like the back button
which is just a home button and
fingerprint reader now because the
volume rocker has been moved back to the
side the main thing you'll see however
is that there is a dual camera setup on
the back and of course when it comes to
the design of this mostly metal phone
you will be able to remove the bottom
portion in order to remove the battery
and add in new modules now we'll focus
on the modules in a little bit but the
main thing here is that at 5.3 inches in
that screen the LG g5 does still manage
to be for the most part pretty easy to
use in one hand speaking of that 5.3
inch display however it does come in a
quad HD resolution and it is an IPS
display much like the one that is found
on the iPhone 6s however it does come in
at 1334 by 750 resolution instead so
you're going to have a big drop-down in
res
lucien still the colors still look
pretty well good on both of these
devices even if the smaller size of the
iPhone 6s might make you go for the
slightly larger one but of course you do
have the 6s plus if you really need more
real estate for fun and work and in the
age-old battle of Android versus iOS one
of the first places to see the
differences is in performance the Apple
a9 rounds out to the package the
performance package of the iPhone 6s
powered by power VR graphics and 2
gigabytes of RAM now that is to Apple's
credit that they only have one main
device in order to provide what is
needed for the performance package to
perform well but on the other hand you
need to have a lot of power for most
flagship devices on Android and the
Snapdragon 820 backed by the adrenal 530
and 4 gigabytes of RAM are what the LG
g5 are able to boast that's not to say
that the LG UX 5.0 in this case of the
LG g5 isn't able to keep up with what is
mostly a smooth experience on the iPhone
on the contrary the phone is able to
really perform quite well thus far and
we don't expect there to be too many
changes in the performance and
smoothness of the g5 once we get our
hands and we do our full review of the
retail unit but it's in hardware that
things really tend to get a little bit
different here as the iPhone still has
the same unibody design that you would
expect as elegant as it is many of its
parts pretty much all of them really are
not removable or replaceable we'll start
off with storage as 16 32 and 128
gigabyte capacities are available for
the iPhone 6s and you're probably gonna
have to pay a lot of money in order to
get those higher capacities on the other
hand the 32 gigabytes worth of storage
inside of the g5 is user expandable so a
micro SD card is going to help you get
all the storage that you need the
fingerprint readers are also a little
bit different in the case of the iPhone
it is made much faster this time around
in the success to the point where when
you actually hit the home button it
already read your fingerprint and it
unlocks immediately on the other hand
the fingerprint reader on the g5 is a
little bit more like the 6p where you
don't necessarily have to hit that
button on the back to wake the phone and
then it will unlock you could just have
your finger on the back and it will wake
and unlock on its own but of course the
main story here is all about the modular
design
of the LG g5 now obviously that means
you are able to remove the battery and
as we've shown in a number of
demonstrations there's a small little
button on the bottom corner that allows
you to remove the whole bottom panel
it's at that point that you can snap off
the replaceable battery put another one
in if you need extra power or you can
put that into a number of different
modules that will extend the
capabilities of the LG g5 now we are
going to review modules like the cam
plus and also the hi-fi audio panel that
is available for the LG g5 but that will
be in our full review for now however we
will give LG a lot of credit for really
taking a push into what might be the
future of smartphones by creating a
modular design in the g5 and we're
excited to see how useful it becomes
with our full unit speaking of batteries
a twenty eight hundred million power
battery in the LG g5 has proven to be
pretty good so far but again this is our
pre-production unit and things could
change when the full retail unit is
reviewed as it is being reviewed right
now the iPhone on the other hand has a
1715 million power battery and the one
thing that we always give credit to
Apple for on the iPhone is great standby
time and when you're using it
well it does have the standard let's say
iPhone battery life in the fact that a
lot of people tend to ask if there is a
plug nearby by the end of the day it's
at this point that we get into the
cameras now the first thing we'll say is
that the iPhone has a 12 megapixel rear
camera and it does not have oh is oh is
is made just for the 6s plus camera and
it has no manual controls in the app
which is something you probably knew
already on the other hand Android has
really been trying to put manual
controls in a lot of cameras and the g5
is no exception you have a 16 megapixel
rear camera and the full manual pro mode
controls that are available but the main
edition in the g5 is a great wide-angle
135-degree eight megapixel camera that
proves to be incredibly fun now we're
not going to pixel peep a whole lot here
obviously because we don't have the full
retail unit for this particular
comparison but we wanted to give you
guys a number of examples between these
two phones of their camera quality and
you can pretty much judge for yourself
it will give you an idea of what the LG
g5 will be able to provide once you get
your hands on a full retail units but
ultimately we wanted to just highlight
the
fact that the wide-angle camera is
really fun to use and it has a wide wide
angle so that even if you don't want to
use the front-facing camera
the 8 megapixel front facing camera of
the g5 you can just turn the phone
around and you don't have to worry about
getting anything in your shot because it
will all be captured so it's obviously
going to be a bit of a change for any
Android user to use the g5 when it
doesn't have the app drawer but at the
very least it will be made available as
LG s said over the last few days as a
download that you can put on to the
phone if you really do need the app
drawer back that said however the LG UX
5.0 still has quite a few of the
different quirks and the different
features that make it the LG UI
including the qslide applications which
originally we thought would have gone by
the wayside because they're not in the
notification drop-down but in reality
they're actually just a bit hidden
normally it would be a bit of a
no-brainer but now that the app drawer
is not necessarily in the LG UX unless
you put it in there we will focus on the
fact that Android still remains one of
the most customizable OS is out there
and not to say that iOS 9 doesn't look
that great it just matters how you want
things to look on whichever phone you
end up choosing a main Edition in the
software of the LG g5 has to do with the
display the always-on display which is a
nice way of getting a quick look at what
notifications you have along with the
time and date without having to unlock
the phone it's not a bad way of
leveraging a feature of the display on
the g5 which is a little bit like 3d
touch does on the iPhone success and
speaking of 3d touch it is a new layer
onto the software that leverages the
pressure sensitivity of the display
which is really nice when you press hard
enough on an icon you will get extra
shortcuts so you don't have to actually
go through the application to do certain
tasks and then it will unlock a few
extra capabilities in other parts of the
OS ultimately 3d touch is not
necessarily a killer feature of the
iPhone and it's a feature that while we
think is good if it wasn't there we
probably wouldn't miss it a whole lot
the LG g5 is available now but make sure
you catch our full review so you can see
whether it is the phone that you want to
have among all the flagships this year
it is going to be available for the
regular price for flagships especially
with carriers but you will be able to
get bundles with different LG
friends or modules like the camp plus so
that might sweeten the pot a little bit
more the iPhone on the other hand is
still available across all major
carriers for the main prices but if
you're going to get it unlocked it does
carry a pretty penny especially for the
larger capacities so that should do it
for this quick look at the LG g5 and the
Apple iPhone again we do have the g5
pre-production unit for this particular
video but our full review will give you
more details on how we feel about the
phone and its various features including
the modules the iPhone 6s on the other
hand is of course going to be one of
those phones that we compare them to and
if you want a closer look at them we
will do a camera shootout between these
two and other Android phones in the
market as well so stay tuned for that
and our full review of the LG g5 coming
very very soon and you can stay tuned
