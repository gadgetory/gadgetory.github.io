android authority and I'm live here from
e3 2015 and earlier today we got to hang
out with e3 and check out a couple of
games and I got the chance to take a
look at minions paradise and this is a
builder's harvest type game so similar
to a game like farmville I hate to make
that particular reference but that's
really the only game that I can sort of
a sort of think of in terms of its
similarity so with minions paradise you
basically have a base or a piece of land
rather an island in this particular game
where you can build yourself up you can
build different things and you can also
accomplish a bunch of different classes
sort of grow your minions and expand
upon your world and it's a really
immersive game of the graphics on it
actually look really incredible and if
you love despicable me and you just love
minions you're going to totally enjoy
this game and there's actually a lot of
different complexities to this game as
you move further along and complete the
quest and just get more involved into
the game is really surprising how how
deep this game goes for a game that's
based on minions essentially so it was a
pretty awesome experience but again the
graphics really look amazing and it's a
very immersive game and I didn't really
expect for the game to be so involved as
it was there's just a lot of things that
you can do and the game's going to be
constantly updated so as you as you
complete the different quests and all
the different things in this game EA is
going to update the game and add a lot
more things to it so essentially the
game is going to virtually be endless in
a way if they continue to keep updating
this game there are in app purchases
that's just something to be aware the
game itself is free but if you want to
advance yourself more quickly or you
just don't want to wait to build certain
things or complete certain quests or
just wait for anything to happen in the
game in general you can speed things up
with the in-app purchases so it's very
similar to other games I have in-app
purchases like clash of clans for
example where you can use your coins or
your gems things that nature to further
advance yourself throughout the game but
essentially it's a really awesome game
and I think
many people will enjoy again especially
if they really love minions if they have
a fascination for them I know there's a
ton of people out there that do so it's
definitely worth checking out and it's
coming to android and iOS it's already
sort of in a limited release right now
but it will be available to pretty much
everyone later this year so make sure to
check that game out again we're coming
to you live here at e3 2015 stay tuned
for more of our coverage there's still
another day left so stick around for
that and as always thank you so much for
watching guys keep it tuned here to
android authority because we are your
source for all things android and e3
