what's going on everybody and here we
are with the LG stylist here at MWC 2016
this is the larger of the mid-range
devices and it actually kind of looks
like a throwback to the LG G pro series
and it also has a couple of elements
that are different from the current new
lineup of smartphones the LG g5 of
course did away with the back button
layout and you have it here in the outdo
stylus which in my opinion is kind of
nice to have because personally I really
like the rear facing buttons we'll go
ahead and get the specs out of the way
the stylus has a 1.2 gigahertz quad-core
processor with 1.5 gigabytes of RAM you
do get a micro SD card slot to bolster
the 16 gigabytes of on-board storage and
the 5.7 inch 720p display provides
pretty decent colors and output a 13
megapixel rear camera with an 8
megapixel front camera as for all the
imaging and a 3000 milliamp hour battery
it sounds about right for a 5.7 inch
display all things consider this is
actually a phone that feels kind of nice
in the hand you have a textured backing
and the 5.7 inch display does make it
feel a little bit meteor in the hand
however with this larger display we do
think it's a bit of a bummer that it
only comes in at 720p resolution but of
course the main crux of this experience
is the stylus itself now LG doesn't
always put out a stylus type experience
on its smartphones and with the LG
stylus you get it right here
a nice feature coming into this is one
you may have seen before on samsung
devices but LG's own version of what can
be considered a pen command menu is the
pen pop a mode that toggles a special
shortcut menu when the stylus is removed
and you get a look at a number of
different functions including ones that
can be user defined and it Paul pops in
from the side and it looks quite nice
but there's also the pen keeper which
notifies you when you're walking away
from your stylus that way it will detect
that the phone is in motion without the
pen installed now of course this LG
stylus is going to be a somewhat jump
forward from last year's g4 stylus but
an improved stylus experience and a
better out-of-the-box software that uses
Android 6.0 marshmallow yes without the
app drawer as this is another one of
those phones from LG that does not
the app drawer will be able to provide
enough to win the hearts of LG fans who
want a more affordable phone with a
stylus experience keep it tuned to
Android authority for even more from LG
as we take a look at the lineup of their
phones after the dust is settled from
there LG g5 announcement keep it tuned
to your for even more because we are
your source for all things m WC 2016</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
