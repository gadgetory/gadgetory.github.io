just keep pouring in and today I got
quite a few but this is the one you are
all probably waiting to see hey it's
Josh regard from Android authority
what's going on everybody
and it's time to unbox and give my first
impressions on the Samsung Galaxy Note 4
and voila the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and
all of its glory we have the Black
Edition right here but as I take out the
phone it already feels pretty premium I
mean obviously we have the metal all
around the brand-new metal that Samsung
has finally adopted for their particular
phones and here we are so I'm going to
put that aside for a second and take a
look at what is inside the box taking a
look inside this is a European edition
like you said like we said already and
with that we have European language that
looks like this is German for the for
the manual here's our micro USB charging
cord the battery some headphones which
look like they are of a pretty good
construction these are actual in-ear
earbuds IEMs it looks like it and yeah
they're better than your standard one so
we're going to put that right above here
the charger the adapter rather for the
micro USB charging cable and then of
course some extra pins for the actual
note stylus the S Pen and finally some
extra buds in case you need them for
these headphones but yeah that pretty
much does it for the unboxing this is
what you have inside of the box but of
course what we're all here to see is a
samsung galaxy note 4 there is the
backing this faux leather backing
originally introduced in the galaxy note
3 but this time we don't have the
stitching on the sides it just feels
like a nice premium phone already not
just not going away from the glossy
plastic certainly is something that
everyone is going to like but of course
we have this metal over on the sides in
the frame that's all
it already feels pretty nice even
without the battery in there so it feels
pretty light but here is the peeling of
the front and there you have it
get the battery back on get the back
cover back on there as well this power
back on and see what happens
hasn't really detected it or rather kind
of set up with that just yet there you
go it looks like everything is working
just fine have the 4G going already this
is my t-mobile SIM that I have on there
so like I pretty much expected already
it doesn't look like we're going to have
any issues when it comes to the type of
SIM that we put in there at least with
this version that I'm going to be
reviewing and with that we have
completed our setup I'm actually quite
happy that the SIM card didn't pose an
issue mames I'm obviously using an
American t-mobile card and it said
European SIM card only but it did not
give me any problems if I go over to the
internet right now and just head over to
Google right now actually we have right
there Google looks like it goes through
just fine and it works perfectly as far
as my initial impressions on you know we
are looking at the operating system
right now this is TouchWiz as updated as
it has been obviously this is the newest
version of TouchWiz we're working with
with the newest Galaxy Note device it
does look pretty nice things seem to be
a little bit more easy on the eyes and
they were before especially for those of
you who may not have like TouchWiz in
the past but we're going to see just
what happens when we take out that S Pen
and play around with some of the new
features that have been introduced in
here there have been quite a few and
you're going to see some videos on those
and they will all be scrutinized in the
full review as far as the aesthetic goes
this is definitely in my opinion what
the note line should have looked like in
the first place or rather this is
basically Samsung proving that they have
designed down when it comes to their
flagship device right here and they have
a down pat with the great faux leather
on the back that gives it a nice grip
but also a very executive look and then
of course this metal frame that goes all
the way around it ready feels really
nice you may have seen it already in the
samsung galaxy alpha but it returns here
in the galaxy note 4 and this is the one
that everyone is likely going to be
clamoring for we do also have as you can
see up there the heart rate monitor that
was originally introduced in the Samsung
Galaxy s5
but of course it now has some extra
functions like like performing as a
shutter button for you to use when
taking selfies all right now I will
address this particular issue with the
Samsung Galaxy s4 but I don't think it's
really even an issue at all everyone's
winning really blowing it up gap gate
that's pretty much what they're talking
about that there's a little gap from the
screen now we have the 2.5 D glass
that's here so it does have a bit of a
subtle curve to it but apparently
there's a gap right in between right
here and everyone's been shoving little
pieces of paper in it so I'm gonna do
the same thing I will show you if that
is actually the case it actually doesn't
go very deep in but nonetheless there
you go I have a piece of paper stuck in
there right now now yes there's a gap in
there and it ready has been revealed
that in the manual not only for the
Samsung Galaxy Note 4 but for the two
iterations before it that it has already
said in the manual there is going to be
this gap and a lot of friction and wear
and tear might cause it to expand a
little bit but it is a design an aspect
on here that pretty much is something
that they had to do for this particular
device ah does it take away from the
look of the actual device no not at all
you're going to see a close-up right
here that you the gap itself is not even
really that visible um if at all and
really if it is a way to put that panel
on there with the metal frame that goes
all the way around it then it makes
complete sense to me so honestly if the
gap on this gets any wider or if I see
something very glaring on there of
course I'm going to tell you guys about
it but as of right now I can stick a
piece of paper in there but that's about
it
it really doesn't detract from really
the usage or even the look most
importantly of the Samsung Galaxy Note 4
Adam this is definitely one of the most
anticipated phones of the year and if I
would argue so I would say that this is
definitely Samsung's flagship even more
so than the Galaxy S line but I'll get
into that in a couple of videos that are
coming very soon as I explore it the
Galaxy Note 4 and also I returned to the
galaxy s5 in order to see where it
stands now that this Note 4 is in
existence so keep it tuned here drop us
some legs on our videos and subscribe to

once you're done with all of that make
sure you head on over to android
