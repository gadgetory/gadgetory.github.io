not talking Kodiak and the bear I'm
talking Kodak the camera company just
pop in one of those tiny place bobs and
shoot dominant for many decades they
actually invented the digital camera
later to go bankrupt because they
couldn't innovate a new business model
surrounding the digital camera well they
have come up with a phone phone that's
going to be released this week well what
is left of the Kodak Company has tried
to innovate itself and come up with a
phone it's called the Kodak ACTRA and it
arrives just in time for Christmas
this bizarre device will go on sale
December 9th in Germany with other
markets to follow specs for the Kodak
extra include a heavy focus on
photography naturally with a 21
megapixel fast focused camera with PDAF
and oh is f 2.0 aperture and a dual LED
flash the front-facing camera also
sports PDAF and comes with a 13
megapixel camera and an F 2.2 aperture
it has a full manual mode a Super eight
VCR video filter and scene selection
hardware dial complete the picture but
the extra has an incredibly capable host
of competitors already crowding the
smartphone photography space other specs
include Android marshmallow right out of
the box a deco core Helio X 20 chipset
clocked at 2.3 gigahertz three gigabytes
of RAM and 32 gigabytes of expandable
storage a 3000 milliamp hour battery
with USB type-c and fast charging Kodak
also offers a fancy retro phone case but
for 69 euros I should call it a bloody
camera bag alright let's keep things
moving along to the alleged two leaks we
found on the samsung galaxy a5 2017
edition a few weeks ago we posted an
exclusive in collaboration with on lakes
for the upcoming 2017 version of the a5
now Samsung has not officially announced
anything but we did find some new photos
and a hands-on video this time around
the video and renders come
from a person named Neil Potgieter who
in the clip says he's doing a quote
review of the 2017 samsung galaxy a5
however since the phone hasn't been
announced yet let alone released this
review is likely a pre-production
prototype for the phone for example the
video shows the phone running on android
6.0 point 1 marshmallow but it's more
than possible that the final 2017 galaxy
a5 could have android 7.0 right out of
the box well everyone loves bezel estate
well let's talk about Nubia my drivers
has stumbled across a sleek-looking
Nubia concept for a bezel a smartphone
along with this modern trend the design
also takes inspiration from phones of
yesteryear featuring a slider design to
extend the compact form factor for calls
and selfies much like shammies phone and
the earlier Sharp Aquos crystal for that
matter the bezel is panel allows the
display to extend right to the edge of
the top and sides of the phone to
maximize the display the concepts
additional slide down mechanism used to
reveal the front-facing camera flash and
speaker certainly make the most of the
display and address the issue of the
front-facing camera placement that we
had with the me mix it also looks rather
cool the back of the phone is less
exciting but does show off a selection
of customizable cases including metal
wood and even leather options alright
before we go we gotta talk about
cyanogen ink for those of you who've
been following me for a while you'll
know that I have been covering cyanogen
for a while now specifically the CEO
Curt my cast her in his bombastic ways
he was the guy who famously said that he
was going to steal Android away from
Google that he was going to be the
bullet to Google's head crazy stuff and
he drew a lot of negative attention for
it also from me now we heard from Steve
Kondik the co-founder of cyanogen Inc
and he talked about the company's
failings
we started cyanogen Inc with the intent
to bring CyanogenMod to more people and
ship on devices right out of the box I
hired everyone I knew including a lot of
community folks moved everyone to
Seattle and we got
work we got the project in order after a
few years of technical debt and started
to have some successes with our first
devices and then things took a turn for
the worse unfortunately once we started
to see success my co-founder Kurt
Makassar apparently became unhappy with
running the business and not owning the
vision this is when the bullet to the
head and other misguided meteor nonsense
started and the bad business deals were
signed being second-in-command all I
could do was to try and stop it do
damage control and hope every day that
something new didn't happen now I should
say here that not all is necessarily
lost if you look in the link below
there's another link to this article
where Steve Condit actually pleads with
the community specifically the ROM
community and the mod community to ask
for feedback if he could raise money and
start again start over again fresh what
should he do differently he wants to
hear from the community so you want to
check that link out and contribute if
you can meet Jeremy shoemaker otherwise
known as shoe money and he became famous
for this photo where he showed off a
cheque that he made from Google Adsense
and he's become so good at making online
businesses that he made an announcement
that he does not start a new business
unless he can secure the business's name
in a.com now why is that exactly well no
domain name extension tells your story
with the same degree of trust as a calm
or dotnet domain name.com and dotnet
domain name extensions inject
credibility and your online presence and
who doesn't want to be credible and
