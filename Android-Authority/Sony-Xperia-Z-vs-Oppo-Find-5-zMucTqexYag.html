what's going on everybody and today I
have another blockbuster versus for you
this time pitting two of the best
performing 5-inch screen devices on the
market today
now a company called Appa might have
come out of left field with their first
big smartphone offering and it happened
to be one of the best while we're gonna
pit it against Sony's best with their
flagship device so let's see how they
stack up because this is the Sony Xperia
Z versus the Oppo find five let's start
it off by throwing up the scoreboard for
the Xperia Z alright here we have a
black slate look with a rectangular
fully flat design the Z is quite the
looker and all those flaps give it water
resistance and now for the Apple fine 5
that sleek white back is the contrast to
a large display and front both are
really attractive phones and get
numerous complements wherever they go so
we have a tie on design but when it
comes to feel it is the Xperia Z that
gets the point why because of that
button layouts having the big silver
button and volume rockers half way down
the right side makes them so much easier
to reach than the rather typical layout
of button opposite volume on the Oppo
fine 5 if you've been following our an
Xperia Z coverage then it's no secret
that the TFT 5-inch 1080p screen has
some poor viewing angles it becomes even
more apparent when you put it up against
the awesome IPS LCD performer of the
Apple fine 5 seriously look at how vivid
the screen of the fine 5 looks no matter
how you're glancing at it you'll get a
great experience with the Xperia Z when
looking dead on but it's obvious that
the Apple fine 5 has the advantage here
you're looking at the same processor
packages in either phone a 1.5 gigahertz
Snapdragon s4 pro processor with adreno
320 GPUs and 2 gigabytes of RAM while
they might carry the same performers
within the Xperia Z does routinely score
around 20,000 in antutu benchmark over
the average score of 18,000 for the fine
5 while these scores do put the Xperia Z
on top both are still admittedly very
snappy in practise and neither truly
feel slower than the other it is in the
hardware department though that the
Xperia Z makes some extra headway while
both phones can offer 16 or 32 gigabytes
of memory installed only the Xperia Z
makes it expandable with an SD card slot
also the Apple find five only comes with
HSDPA connectivity while LTE versions of
the Xperia Z are available quite simply
put the Z offers a little bit more here
all right so we're onto software both
have jellybean 4.1.2 installed with
their respective skins the Xperia U eye
looks very much like Ice Cream Sandwich
which gives it and a simplistic elegance
the Apple UI on the other hand looks a
lot more bloated but that isn't
necessarily a bad thing some people like
the me UI style blocks and blobby
widgets other than that everything looks
very bare-bones and doesn't ever really
exude extra functionality so I give the
Xperia UI the point here not just
because it is sleeker but because it
includes higher functioning apps like
the Walkman and even small apps for
quick multitasking again it just offers
more here and finally the cameras both
the Xperia Z and the fine 5 have 13
megapixel shooters though the sony exmor
RS sensor is a factor here nonetheless
the resulting picture quality is quite
comparable for both the Xperia Z ops for
a darker tone generally but the details
in both are still pretty well captured
once again however the Apple fine 5s
bare bones nature makes the camera
pretty simplistic the sony editions of
superior auto and various scene modes
puts the higher functioning Xperia Z on
top and finally we land on price the
Xperia Z might have an advantage when it
gets on a carrier as it can then get a
lowered price on contracts but when
fully unlocked the Apple fine 5 actually
has the lower price tag starting at 499
dollars compared to the generally over
$700 price of the Xperia Z and so there
you have it the Xperia Z is like a very
high functioning laptop made by a big
manufacturer while the Apple fine 5
feels more like a bare-bones but still
high-end notebook the Xperia Z does
offer a little bit more than the Apple
fine 5 though so it walks away in this
battle but the really really great
screen on top of the very good
specifications that rival the Xperia Z
make the fine 5 still a great contender
figure out what you really want from
these two handsets though and you really
can't go wrong with either choice and as
