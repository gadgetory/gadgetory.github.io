what's going on everybody and I'm here
with Jordan who is with otterbox he is a
Media Relations Specialist here and he's
going to be demoing a couple products
for us I wanted to take a look at a
product for the s4 as well as a product
for the HTC One but the cases for the
most part are pretty much the same only
made to fit different devices so we're
going to look at the s4 devices right i
mean products right now so Jordan what
he got for us so a couple of different
things number one being the defender
series this is our best selling case
line and something that we've got for a
wide variety of Android devices and just
a few of the basics to it built-in
screen protector full polycarbonate
shell all the way around the device and
then a silicone skin over the top of
that this is a version with realtree
camouflage as well this is available for
the galaxy s3 and I'm not sure if that
will happen for the s4 or not just come
to pens but you can get in a variety of
different colors and really the greatest
thing to it is the fact that it's pretty
quick and simple to put on really great
drop in shock protection keeps out dust
you've still got access to all of it if
the different ports like the headphone
jack and charging everything like that
so you get the same user experience with
the device but in a really really nice
rugged protection to go along with it
and then on top of that we've also got
the commuter series it's a very pocket
friendly case lightweight if you don't
need as much protection as the defender
series provides comes with a
self-adhering screen protector put on
yourself a silicone skin and then a
polycarbonate over the top so that
slides in and out of your pocket nicely
doesn't add a lot of bulk or weight to
the phone but still provides really good
drop in shock protection and of course
we're not going to be looking at it
right now but there are other cases for
even more protection associate ones were
say waterproofing and stuff like that
right yes exactly so we've got what's
called the armor series is our top of
the line we call it the toughest case
ever built really over-the-top sort of
protection for people who are out there
in the field go out and do really rugged
outdoor activities or maybe people who
are just really clumsy yeah I think over
the top was definitely the word that I
was thinking of when I was looking at
earlier so this is a kind of one thing I
wanted to ask was or one of the few
things I wanted to ask was so what as
far as the philosophies behind an
otterbox for a phone what do you usually
try to sort of be specific on when it
comes to protection of these
which costs a lot of money and yeah for
the most part can be pretty fragile too
yeah so it all really comes down to form
fit and function for us to go along with
the smartphone I mentioned it earlier
but we always want to make sure that you
had the exact same user experience with
the case on as you do without any case
you know these devices are made to be
really high-end they're really great
really fast really sensitive and we want
all of that to remain true we just want
to make sure that when you take it out
with you you can go do the things that
you would normally do in daily life and
not have to worry about it breaking and
I what we have been seeing here at CTI
at least are a lot of at least mid-range
phones that have the really ruggedized
body's already built in what sort of
what would it be sort of your response
to somebody who's thinking oh maybe I
should get a rugged phone rather than
another phone with an otterbox on top
well and so I think it really comes down
to what you're looking for in a device
if you're looking for something that
doesn't necessarily provide all the
features of say a galaxy s4 maybe that
mid-range phone is for you and maybe you
are able to just kind of sidestep the
case altogether and go with it I think
we're OtterBox really plays in is that
we've always tried to stay on the
cutting edge of technology and that
includes being in on those cutting edge
phones like the galaxy s4 the HTC One
and some of those other really really
hot devices that are out there right now
so it's really a matter of personal
preference but it's something we're at
the end of the day we feel that you're
not adding a whole lot to the phone but
you're getting a whole lot more out of
it all right well really good way to put
that up all right so I've been asking
everybody I've been interviewing this
question and I'm just going to segue
right into it a little bit off offbeat
it's not necessarily about OtterBox but
I'm just gonna ask you straight object
what phone are you rocking I'm rocking
an iphone 4s right now i am just way
behind the times always have been you
know it's one of those things where
every time i get really close to
upgrading and getting a new device
something else comes out and kind of
makes me want it so it's just a matter
of me really really indecisive yeah
exactly so if that's the case so we know
why you're on that because kind of just
missing the mark every now and then but
is there a phone out there that you
really want the one that I have not
played with a whole lot that I hear
really great things about I'm really
intrigued with is the HTC One so I've
been hearing that from everybody so far
yeah I've seen it one time here at the
show I haven't played with it outside of
that just couple of minutes a day
around with it but it's a really really
great device feels really good in the
hand and it's one of those words like I
can see myself maybe upgrading to it but
it's again it's making a decision and
sometimes I'm not the best at that well
I'm just a heads up to you from me HTC
actually has the stealth black edition
out and they have it on display here so
if you want to check it out it's a
really good song that's really good tip
then yeah alright great well that was
just a quick talk with jordyn here at
otter box and thank you so much right
absolutely alright it's josh a
archimandrite already coming to you live
