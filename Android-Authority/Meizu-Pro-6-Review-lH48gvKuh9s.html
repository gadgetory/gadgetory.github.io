our review of the meizu pro six the
first thing you think of when looking at
this phone is anything other than wow
that looks like an iPhone are you all
crazy well just like any other Mazie
phone the design has obviously been
heavily inspired by Apple but before you
blow this off is just another cheap
iPhone ripoff stick around to hear what
this phone is actually capable of
because surprisingly it's really good
and it has some creative ideas of its
own and even though we've seen this
design before it still looks and feels
very nice the pro six has a unibody
aluminum design and the metal here feels
very high quality there's no sharp
corners anywhere with the phone as a
sides curved to meet the back and the
front of the phone also has slight
curves on the sides where the display
ends to make the edges of the phone it
feels really nice we have some antenna
bands with a unique design at the top
and bottom of the back with an ever so
slightly
HTC 10s camera lens and then Dern eath
this is a funky 10 LED flash power and
volume buttons are on the right with
your speaker headphone jack and charging
ports at the bottom and yes this is the
most familiar design feature of the
phone but there's nothing to complain
about here
it's a beautiful bill that also feels
incredible in the hands with this
aluminum finish and unibody design as we
push that power button were greeted with
a very nice 5.2 inch Super AMOLED
display it's a 1080p screen and with
this screen size we're looking at a PPI
of 423 which is great and no it's not
the highest resolution but it doesn't
have that flicker effect on the eyes
while moving the phone at quick speeds
and the whites are really great on here
even when putting the phone down to its
lowest brightness settings a lot of
AMOLED displays start to get very warm
and pinkish here but the Mesa pro 6
performs very well delivering true
whites no matter where the brightness is
set with this being AMOLED black areas
of the screen or a true black which
makes other colored areas of the display
up here to pop a little more it gives
you a lot more depth there's also a lot
of
we features here to build right into the
software like eye protection we like
supposedly can be harmful to your eyes
especially when trying to sleep so
taking the screen to a more orange hue
can be done here you can also change
color temperature as well which is
similar but a lot more subtle and lastly
display modes to increase or decrease
the saturation of colors I was really
impressed with the display here and even
though you can make out the pixels while
being up close the 423 PPI is still more
than enough and it's very
energy-efficient but we're not quite
done here with a display or the iPhone
comparisons for that matter because the
meizu pro 6 has 3d touch yes actual 3d
touch what I'm doing here isn't a long
press the Mesa pro 6 is display is
pressure sensitive and this is a first
for an Android device they call it force
touch here although it has multiple
layers and works just like what we've
seen on the iPhone 6s and 6s plus in
fact all the uses for this feature are
ones that we've seen before but they're
actually very helpful they're mostly
used for shortcuts like on the home
screen a long press will rearrange icons
like what we've seen for years but a
forced press will display different
shortcuts like video mode or selfie mode
for the camera you can also customize
the amount of pressure needed in
settings we also have peek and pop
gestures just like on iOS where a touch
with a decent amount of pressure will
give you a preview of an image and as
you add pressure the preview will get
larger and larger until it pops to full
size the problem is pretty much all
Android apps are not able to support
this force press just yet so you'll be
stuck to using this feature on Macy's
home screen or their own apps like
gallery or mail etc and that's probably
going to be it for a while until Google
incorporates this new functionality into
their software on the bottom of the
display you'll find a single home button
and just like the pro 5 disk button
doubles as a fingerprint scanner and the
speed I wish this scanner performs
really shocked me it's one of the
fastest if not the fastest fingerprint
scanner I've used on an Android phone
you do have to push the button first to
turn on the display before the scanner
begins to read but once the screen is on
your finger only needs to tap the sander
for a brief moment and the phone will
unlock now it's not too fast where a
press of the home button will send you
past your notification screen but if the
screen is already
and your finger makes contact it'll
unlock instantly now you'll notice that
the pro six is display is on yet there
are no on-screen navigation buttons and
there's no capacitive navigation buttons
either so where is the back button and
multitasking button well the back button
is actually built into the home button a
simple tap will trigger a back command
it will definitely take some time
getting used to but one button doing it
all is a pretty cool idea and it's very
easy to get used to it as for the recent
apps button is not as practical but it's
still quite unique sliding from the
bottom of the screen and up will bring
up your recent apps with a very cool
animation as you slide up their app
you're on will slowly shrink as your
other recent apps come into frame it's
actually very clever and the animation
here just makes sense it can be kind of
annoying trying to actually trigger this
however going slowly will always work
but that can get frustrating if you're
someone who's constantly switching apps
the speaker sits at the bottom which
makes it very easy to cover up and the
sound will always be facing away from
you when watching videos but once again
this was another area where the meizu
pro 6 really shocked me this is one of
the best sounding bottom facing speakers
on an Android smartphone it gets very
loud and delivers very nice space and
it's very clear well not being tinny it
just sounds really great under the hood
we have a pretty powerful processor and
GPU combo along with 4 gigs of RAM you
have two storage sizes at 32 gigs or 64
gigs and unfortunately there's no
microSD card slot during the phone to
some benchmarks gave me some interesting
results with Geekbench giving the phone
a really high score in the six thousands
which is very impressive
however with antutu it didn't quite
reach 100k but still overall very
promising results as for real-world
usage the phone performs very well it
never really slowed up launching and
switching between apps is very snappy
and gaming is great too
although gaming isn't the smoothest
experience it's still very much playable
the meizu pro 6 packs a pretty small
2560 milliamp hour battery which is even
smaller than last generations you can
actually still get some pretty decent
battery life out of this thing thanks to
the lower res screen and the energy
efficient processor I was able to get
about 3 hours and 45 minutes
on average with moderate use for me
that's just enough to get me through an
entire day but once in a while I did
have to charge an hour before I call it
a day
but when you do have to charge USB
type-c is there which is very convenient
with this reversibility but just like
all meizu phones we have something that
will split a lot of Android users and
that's its software skin called fly meet
OS in the past I really didn't like it
but this year there have been many
improvements that make it easier to get
used to there still isn't an app drawer
so you'll have to resort to making lots
of folders you can easily install
third-party launcher like Nova or Google
now the pulldown menu is not divided
into two sections anymore which is great
to hear and your shortcuts and
notifications are all displayed in the
same place and if you need to access
more shortcuts just simply pull down
again there's finally a Settings icon in
the top right like all Android phones
something that was missing on previous
versions of fly me OS and fly me OS
bring some cool features to like a
gesture menu within settings that's
loaded with different gesture inputs
like double tap to wake notification
pulldown and eight letter gestures that
can trigger a launch of any app you
decide it's definitely a very heavily
skinned version of Android that lots of
users will have to get used to but just
because this different doesn't mean that
it's bad and the changes that meizu has
made are actually pretty clever so now
let's move on to the camera which is a
large 21 megapixel sensor with laser
autofocus the 10 LED dual tone flash and
no optical image stabilization photos
are kind of a mixed bag with that 21
megapixels you can really zoom and crop
in a good amount but pictures don't
appear very sharp and then you begin to
lose details it's also a pretty noisy
camera even in well-lit conditions and
often leads towards a warmer side of
things and some areas colors are very
lacking almost looking like some type of
filter was applied but other times while
in bright outdoors you can really get
some decent shots but that lack of color
is still very noticeable in high dynamic
range situations the pro 6 will struggle
but when HDR is turned on it helps but
then it helps almost too much giving a
very unrealistic look in low-light you
can see the usual weakness mid-range
smartphone cameras have you lose more
detail colors are even less colourful
and they're pretty dark and noisy here
HDR
can be pretty hit or miss sometimes
brightening the photo just enough but
sometimes frightening the shot way too
much bringing out details in the shadows
but at the same time blowing out the
details in the highlights and that
crazy-looking 10 LED dual tone flash
sounds awesome but it's not much
different than any other dual tone flash
you'll find on a smartphone it's
probably they're just for looks
the 5-megapixel selfie cam has a larger
pixel size in most in order to capture
more light but selfies are a little
below average in bright outdoors you get
a decent shot although it's quite soft
with some noise but if you're in
anything other than bright light your
selfie shots will come out very blurry
or lots of distracting noise you can
shoot up to 4k with the meizu pro 6 and
it looks pretty decent but at the same
time shaky with the lack of optical
image stabilization and it does struggle
to focus sometimes when moving so in the
end I was really impressed with this
phone yeah coming in I wasn't expecting
much because I knew the Mesa pro 6 was
going to try to implement features that
we've already seen before and I knew is
going to be running a heavily skinned
version of Android but I wasn't
expecting these familiar features to be
implemented so well and the tweaks that
meizu has made to their skin actually
have a creative purpose sure it's not
going to be everybody's cup of tea
but it's a very well-thought-out phone
in every area but what do you guys think
