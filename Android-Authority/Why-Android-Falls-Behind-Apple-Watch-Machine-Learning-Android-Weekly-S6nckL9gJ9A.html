brought to you by FreshBooks this
product has sold over a billion dollars
and that's billion with an a for Apple
so what's up with Android wear it's
official now Apple has a license to
print money in what might be the most
unprecedented financial return ever for
a new product category the company's
quarterly guidance report has numerous
analysts concluding that it may have
sold over a billion dollars worth of
Apple watch devices in the three months
that the wearable has been on sale
despite what some might call a success
the figure is ironically well below the
almost two billion dollars that some had
expected an issue that was likely
fostered by supply shortages or long
waits still this approximated figure
means that the wearable earned more
money than the ipad did or the original
iphone did when they first launched now
I know what some of you are thinking but
please stop hating on Apple and
challenge Samsung HTC Sony and all these
wonderful manufacturers you had two to
three year head start you had a head
start to put out a product out there and
use the marketing to capture people's
imagination normally when a product is
first in a category they dominate that
category they become first in the mind
of the user and that's where the real
battle is but you allowed Apple to come
from behind and kick you in the arse it
is not a battle of products I can hear
some of you thinking already the android
smart watches are better I have a couple
of them that are very very good but it's
not a battle of products it's a battle
of perception in the users mind and most
users think the iWatch is sexy let's
move on to some happy geek news you can
now play half life on your SmartWatch
sort of dave bennett has found a way to
run half life on his first generation LG
G watch while the beloved game
surprisingly actually boots and runs
it's not exactly the sort of experience
that will keep you entertained on the
bus ride home aside from trying to
control the game with your finger
covering the entire 1.6 inch screen the
framerate is rather hit and miss it can
go from 30 frames per second to to frame
per second slide show the game is also
prone to crashing which shouldn't be
surprise there's also only so much you
can do with a low-powered Snapdragon 400
system-on-a-chip and 512 megabytes of
RAM to get the game up and running
Bennet makes use of the SD lash app
which can be used to emulate old titles
that run on Valve's Source engine now
let's talk about something that gets me
all giddy and it's called machine
learning in brief machine learning is
about machine sharing data with other
machines making predictions and learning
to improve on them without being
explicitly programmed to do so right now
this topic of machine learning is abuzz
among geeks and there's a whole company
full of geeks that are really on the
forefront of this google the company has
invested heavily in developing software
models that can learn and applying them
to ever-growing mountains of data all of
google services benefit from this
approach gmail can accurately root out
spam voice recognition in android has
improved dramatically an image
recognition used in photos and maps is
growing more and more accurate this
could have a major impact on things like
translation when machines can process
mountains of data and process that data
and give us the context that we need to
understand that information Wow things
like translators will be obsolete we
won't even need to learn new languages
anymore I mean look at microsoft's
instant translator it's fantastic and
that's just the tip of the iceberg now
as wonderful as all our computer devices
are they still can only do what we tell
them to do imagine for a moment without
a bunch of Skynet fear if machines could
communicate with each other take that
information and decide on how best to
act on it in our best interests the sky
is the limit see right now we have to
tell our devices what to do what if they
didn't have to do that and we could just
live our life and they could give us the
information that we need when we need it
freaking cool you guys know I will
gladly pay for a product that heals a
pain point and few things can be more
painful than billing your clients but
freshbooks makes it simple painless easy
to use both for me and the client and I
like that FreshBooks is the super easy
to use invoicing software that lets you
create and send sharp-looking invoices
track your time and manage your expenses
all from the comfort of your smartphone
staying on top of your billable hours is
ridiculously simple just use the time
tracking feature and you'll know exactly
what work you did and what client you
did it for managing your expenses is
also as easy as taking a picture of your
receipts using the camera on your phone
FreshBooks pretty much does the rest to
get started go to FreshBooks com for
