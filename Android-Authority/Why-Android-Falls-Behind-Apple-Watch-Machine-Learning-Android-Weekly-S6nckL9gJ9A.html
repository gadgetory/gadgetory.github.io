brought to you by fresh books this
product has sold over a billion dollars
and that's billion with an A for Apple
so what's up with Android wear it's
official now Apple has a license to
print money in what might be the most
unprecedented financial return ever for
a new product category the company's
quarterly guidance report has numerous
analysts concluding that it may have
sold over a billion dollars worth of
Apple watch devices in the three months
that the wearable has been on sale
despite what some might call a success
the figure is ironically well below the
almost two billion dollars that some had
expected an issue that was likely
fostered by supply shortages or long
waits still this approximated figure
means that the wearable earned more
money than the iPad did or the original
iPhone did when they first launched now
I know what some of you are thinking but
please stop hating on Apple and
challenge Samsung HTC Sony and all these
wonderful manufacturers you had two to
three year head start you had a head
start to put out a product out there and
use the marketing to capture people's
imagination normally when a product is
first in a category they dominate that
category they become first in the mind
of the user and that's where the real
battle is but you allowed Apple to come
from behind and kick you in the arse it
is not a battle of products I can hear
some of you thinking already the Android
smartwatches are better I have a couple
of them that are very very good but it's
not a battle of products it's a battle
of perception in the users mind and most
users think the eye watch is sexy let's
move on to some happy geek news you can
now play half-life on your SmartWatch
sort of Dave Bennett has found a way to
run half-life on his first generation LG
G watch while the beloved game
surprisingly actually boots and runs
it's not exactly the sort of experience
that will keep you entertained on the
bus ride home aside from trying to
control the game with your finger
covering the entire 1.6 inch screen the
framerate is rather hit and miss it can
go from 30 frames per second to 2 frame
per second slideshow the game is also
prone to crashing which shouldn't
surprise there's also only so much you
can do with a low-powered Snapdragon 400
system-on-a-chip and 512 megabytes of
RAM to get the game up and running
Bennett makes use of the SD lash app
which can be used to emulate old titles
that run on valves Source engine now
let's talk about something that gets me
all giddy and it's called machine
learning in brief machine learning is
about machine sharing data with other
machines making predictions and learning
to improve on them without being
explicitly programmed to do so right now
this topic of machine learning is a buzz
among geeks and there's a whole company
full of geeks that are really on the
forefront of this Google the company has
invested heavily in developing software
models that can learn and applying them
to ever-growing mountains of data all of
Google's services benefit from this
approach Gmail can accurately root out
spam voice recognition in Android has
improved dramatically an image
recognition used in photos and maps is
growing more and more accurate this
could have a major impact on things like
translation when machines can process
mountains of data and process that data
and give us the context that we need to
understand that information Wow
things like translators will be obsolete
we won't even need to learn new
languages anymore I mean look at
Microsoft's instant translator it's
fantastic and that's just the tip of the
iceberg now as wonderful as all our
computer devices are they still can only
do what we tell them to do imagine for a
moment without a bunch of Skynet fear if
machines could communicate with each
other take that information and decide
on how best to act on it in our best
interests the sky is the limit see right
now we have to tell our devices what to
do what if they didn't have to do that
and we could just live our life and they
could give us the information that we
need when we need it
fricking cool you guys know I will
gladly pay for a product that heals a
pain point and few things can be more
painful than billing your clients but
freshbooks
makes it simple painless easy to use
both for me and the client and I like
that FreshBooks is the super easy to use
invoicing software that lets you create
and send sharp-looking invoices
track your time and manage your expenses
all from the comfort of your smartphone
staying on top of your billable hours is
ridiculously simple just use the time
tracking feature and you'll know exactly
what work you did and what client you
did it for managing your expenses is
also as easy as taking a picture of your
receipts using the camera on your phone
fresh books pretty much does the rest to
get started go to fresh books comm for
which slash Android and enter Android
authority and how did you hear about a
section thanks for watching Android army
my name is Jase love to connect with you
right here on Google+ and Twitter and I
will follow you in the comments below
don't forget about my brothers my
brethren and Android we're working super
hard to be your source for all things
