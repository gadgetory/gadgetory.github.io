I'm going to show you my USB adapter for
the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 now I just
got this in the mail for only $5 so it's
a good buy and it's a really functional
if you want to use a USB keyboard or
mouse on your Galaxy Tab as well as if
you want to use a USB flash drive now
anyways I'm just gonna open her up and
then show you how to connect this to
your samsung galaxy tab also demo device
so here we go first off you can see we
have our 16 pin Galaxy Tab connector and
a female USB on the other end so I will
just pop this end into my samsung galaxy
tab see it's a nice snug fit and the
Galaxy Tab does not recognize anything
as of now just I don't have a USB device
plugged in but I will plug in a flash
drive that is actually a USB receiver a
wireless receiver for my mouse you can
see that we have a USB device connected
that's what pops up on the screen so
anyways I've got my wireless mouse I
know this flipper to the on position
C is transmitting its data and now I've
got a nice little mouse on my Galaxy Tab
screen you know if you can see it but uh
go on the browser there and we've got it
on our google write another awesome
feature of our USB adapter is that we
can plug it right into our Galaxy Tab
keyboard dock and basically have a fully
functional computer unit you can see I
have my mouse on my screen here so we
can just do some very quick webpage
scrolling check out android authority
comm just see if it's basically working
like a computer would you have a fully
compatible workstation here we're
scrolling in our mouse and we can click
our article scroll down and scroll up
and we can even click and then type
and we get our Comment and there you go

Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
