in the smartphone world even as we speak
its latest advices have set the bar high
for everyone else including design now
they've come a long way just because for
a long time there they weren't even
thought of as great designers in order
to understand how they got to whether
that now we have to look back so here's
the history of Samsung's Android designs
it wasn't until 2009 when we saw
Samsung's first Android phone which was
a good few months after HTC's t-mobile
g1 Samsung's response was with the
Samsung GTI 7500 or the first Samsung
Galaxy without the S of course it was an
all-plastic affair with several physical
buttons which took design cues from its
touch screen feature phones later on in
2009 the u.s. finally saw its first
Samsung Android phone with the behold -
again it didn't stray far with its
design with its all plastic casing they
did however change things up with the
Samsung moment because it was a
landscape QWERTY slider which some
thought to be response to the t-mobile
g1 in the spring of 2010 the company
announced its first real Android
contender with the Samsung Galaxy S or
the GTI 9000 motorola was coming off the
success of the Droid and HTC with the
hero the Galaxy S was a totally
transformed phone adopting any thinner
chassis however it was still made out of
plastic but undeniably better-looking
than its previous efforts funny things
that it drew comparisons with the iPhone
for the US launch of the Galaxy S we saw
a slew of variants catering to each
carrier AT&amp;amp;T Samsung Captivate was
unique looking for its carbon fiber
pattern rear cover Sprint's ambiguously
named Epic 4G featured a slide-out
landscape QWERTY keyboard and a t-mobile
and Verizon versions were pretty
faithful to the originals design with a
vibrant and fascinate respectively the
Samsung continuum was another Galaxy S
variant but it's remembered by its then
different secondary tech on display that
secondary display is widely considered
as the precursor to today's edge
panel in the Samsung Galaxy edge devices
but back then it was seen more as a
novelty ending the year Samsung was
commissioned to make the second Nexus
the Google Nexus S to be exact you think
that it would been treated to an
original design but that didn't turn out
like that it was yet another Galaxy S
look-alike with its glossy all plastic
construction it was a far cry in design
compared to the Nexus One instead it
introduced a curved glass that covered
the display staying on track the Galaxy
S 2 arrived in early 2011 fashioning
together the skinniest chassis in a
phone at the time besides that it pretty
much lay true to the all plastic design
DNA that Samsung has been exhausting but
it was a bit more rectangular looking
and wider something big shook things up
around the middle of 2011 the original
Samsung Galaxy Note introduced us to the
term phablet it was a totally new
segment since it bridged a smartphone
and compact tablet into one singular
device the design was notable for its
sheer size basically a super-sized
looking version of the galaxy s2 it also
reintroduced and popularized the stylus
with its pressure-sensitive as pen after
the subdued tone of the Nexus S the
previous year my name was shot that
Google reached out to Samsung again to
make the next Nexus this time though
they deliver the goods with the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus it was a totally different
looking phone boasting a cleaner finish
by not having any sort of capacitive or
physical buttons on its facade its most
important design attribute was the
so-called hyper skin finish found on the
back of the phone it definitely gave the
phone a significantly grippier feel and
overall the design was a step forward
things got better for Samsung with the
Galaxy s3 it forged a new design that
brought on several tweaks to
differentiate itself from its
predecessor the rounded corners of the
s3 gave it a friendlier look one that
was noted for being inspired by nature
you see that in chassis with its pebble
S shape underneath it although it was
still polycarbonate plastic but with a
hyper glazed finish that made it look
last year the Samsung Galaxy Note 2
featured a
a 5.5 inch screen a step up over its
predecessor and it followed the galaxy
s3s design with its narrower home button
slightly rounded edges and a good old
polycarbonate for its chassis the
Samsung Galaxy s4 came roaring onto the
scene in 2013 cementing Samsung's status
as the elite smartphone maker in the
world from design aspect there really
wasn't much to be fired about since it
looked very much like ps3 instead its
most remarkable for the amount of
features they were able to cram into the
phone like the hand waving air view
gestures the IR blaster and the eye
tracking movement for vertical scrolling
within the web browser at a corporate
all though the phone's design was still
underwhelming if the note was deemed too
big for you then the galaxy mega was
clearly not something you would have
gone after the phone itself was
obnoxiously large with its massive 6.3
inch display its overall design however
borrowed heavily from the galaxy s4
another interesting design came with the
samsung galaxy s4 zoom it was a phone
camera hybrid because of the 16
megapixel one over 2.3 3-inch BSI sensor
with 10 times optical zoom that was
stuffed into its body it looked like a
chunkier s4 because of that camera now
always the one to go bigger the Samsung
Galaxy Note 3 of things with its 5.7
inch 1080p Super AMOLED display
interestingly they gave it a
sophisticated look by outlining the rear
faux leather cover with a stitched
pattern it's subtle but one that's
different from the norm from Samsung
foundationally the bone was still mostly
plastic but tweaks give the note 3 that
business esque
look and feel another major design
change came with the announcement of the
galaxy s5 the biggest addition to design
was the introduction of a
water-resistant construction giving it
that ip67 certification yes it was still
constructed primarily out of plastic but
it wasn't as slippery as previous Galaxy
S smartphones because of the dimpled
pattern design of its rear cover even
more impressive the S
I was just a monster of a high-end phone
that packed an exorbitant amount of
features consisting of things like an IR
blaster heart rate sensor and yes a
fingerprint sensor it seemingly put
other competing smartphones to shame now
despite the variety of goodies in tow
the design was still nothing to gloat
about that much and that came the
smartphone that totally changed
everything for Samsung the Galaxy alpha
it's a homework device in the company's
history shedding the all plastic
construction that Samsung had tirelessly
exhausted the Galaxy alpha radiated with
an indulgent glow like no other before
it in Samsung's stable just because it
felt like a premium smartphone for a
change
by featuring a real metal trim bezel in
a compact body at a time it was without
question the best design phone out of
Samsung's camp they made sure to keep up
to the new theme by giving the Galaxy
Note 4 the same treatment it also
introduced a shiny metal trim bezel as
well as having the same faux leather
casing with its rear cover if that was
enough they also introduced the Galaxy
Note edge with its curved edge screen
along the right edge
finally Samsung went back to the drawing
board with its sixth generation flagship
Samsung Galaxy s6 and s6 edge ditched
plastic entirely opting instead to go
with glass and metal you could say that
the s6 line looked alien given that it
didn't look like anything previously put
out by the company between the two
smartphones the s6 edge received praise
for how it looks slicker with its dual
curved edges most people familiar with
the flagship line were probably thrown
off by the new metal and glass
construction frankly they screen premium
everywhere but they no longer offered a
water-resistant construction or
expandable storage now some folks were a
bit disappointed by this but the outcome
was still largely positive for Samsung
once fall came around the samsung galaxy
note 5 and the galaxy s6 edge+ both made
their appearances to the public they
were big bones naturally but they
systematically employed Samsung's
your design language they really weren't
all that different from the s6 line
apart from the massive sizes but the
note 5 specifically featured rounded
edges along the back that made it feel
more ergonomic in the hand all this
leads us to where we're at now the
Samsung Galaxy s7 and s7 edge have both
launched bringing along the same but
slightly tweaked premium design language
that's now Samsung's DNA but listen to
some of the criticism that came with the
s6 lines revamped design the previous
year
by bringing back water resistance and
expandable storage the phones are
absolutely gorgeous but they're made
better by their strong overall
performances and rich features so
obviously Samsung has come a long way
since the early days too now they've
grown up and they matured so the designs
are now coveted so if you guys want to

devices I talked about in this video
