8/9 here in Munich Germany sporting a
design that's familiar to previous make
devices the main tonight brings a series
of improvements but is it the handset to
fill the hole left by the galaxy note 7
what's going on everybody is narrow and
this is our hands on with the huawei
mate 9 the mate 9 doesn't have a curved
screen and it isn't quad HD with Huawei
instead opting for a flat 5.9 inch
display a Full HD resolution which meets
96% of the NTSC color standard and has a
high contrast ratio of 1500 to 1
although qHD resolution would have
helped the displays still quite pleasant
to use and offers deep blacks and
vibrant colors like most other flagships
the handset also comes with a blue light
filter which is designed to protect your
eyes from harmful blue light that's most
apparent in dark conditions under the
hood the mate 9 is powered by Huawei
snooker in 960 chipset which is made up
of the latest cortex a 73 architecture
along with Molly's latest G 71 GPU and a
nice 6 code process of a better sense of
Management which Huawei says allows you
to play pokemon go for longer occur in 9
60s partnered with 4 gigabytes of RAM
and 64 gigabytes of storage in the
regular version and while we can't yet
confirm Huawei's claims at the Kiran 960
is the fastest processor in a smartphone
right now the mate 9 certainly shows no
signs of lag to ensure smooth
performance even after several months of
use the main tonight uses a machine
learning algorithm to analyze user
behavior optimize the user experience
and allocate resources according to the
way you use your phone as a result while
we claims the handset is up to 50
percent faster than previous devices and
after 16 months of simulated usage it is
up to 80 percent faster than rival
devices the mate 9 is powered by a four
thousand milliamp hour non removal
battery that comes equipped with Huawei
supercharged which has an intelligent
charger that combined with constant
battery monitoring on the device itself
is designed to avoid any unwanted
overheating situation although it's not
compatible with Qualcomm quick charge
the maintenance free trial did in 90
minutes and can be charged to 50 percent
in just 30 minutes
while you get a car charger included
the box there are no plans to launch a
supercharged compatible battery pack
however the camera picks up from where
the wipey nine left off with the second
generation like a dual camera array
that's made up of 12 megapixel RGB
sensor and a 20 megapixel monochrome
sensor the camera features optical image
stabilization in the color sensor f20
aperture hybrid autofocus and 50%
smaller file sizes for 4k video like
other dual camera devices there's the
ability to capture images with a bach
effect but the mate 9 also allows you to
take a picture and then change the focus
after you've taken the image rather than
the other way around
the ability of the dual camera to
capture depth information allows you to
set the aperture to as little as f dot
zero-nine-five or as high as f 13 and
making these changes either before or
after you've taken the shot is really
straightforward the camera also comes
with a series of other filters and
options including a pro mode that offers
enough manual controls to keep almost
all users happy the mate 9 is the first
handset to run Huawei's new emui 5
interface and although it is visually
similar to previous devices Huawei says
it is their biggest refresh ever a lot
of previous features such as nocknock
customizable home screens and
fingerprint gestures also return but
there's a few differences as well the
first is that there's finally the option
to add an app drawer in the settings
which is ideal for those who prefer the
familiar Android experience as we know
it the second is the ability to switch
accounts by involving different
fingerprints to each account and coupled
with a new privacy space it means that
your entire family could use the phone
but data would remain secured to each
individual a feature that aims to solve
a long-standing problem is apt to in
which duplicates one account apps such
as whatsapp WeChat and Facebook so you
can use them with two different accounts
on the same device Mui 5 is based on
Android 7.0 new go multi window is
supported using nougats native feature
but you can also swipe your knuckle
across the screen to access the spirit
screen although this doesn't always work
the emui 5 essentially seems to be a
compromise where while we is tweak the
pots of Android it feels necessary
rather than aiming to overhaul
everything like other OEMs do alongside
the make 9 while we
also announced the limited-edition posh
design make 9 hero munich and while we
are bringing you a separate look at that
I can say it's the curbed qHD handset
with six gigabytes of RAM that we were
all hoping to make 9 would turn out to
be what do you think of the mate 9 and
emui 5 and do you plan to buy one let us
know in the comments below don't forget
