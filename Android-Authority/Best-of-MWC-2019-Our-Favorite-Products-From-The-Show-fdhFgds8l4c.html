a ton of products here now we did our
best phones of MWC 2019 make sure you
head over to our website in our youtube
channel to check that out but this is
the overall best products of MWC 2019
and of course a lot of these are going
to be phones but there are a lot of
other innovative products here as well
so we're just going to go down the list
and give you a brief summary of the
coolest stuff we saw so first we've got
the huawei mate X which is their
foldable device it is also a 5g device
it basically packs the ethos of MWC into
one big phone and it folds out into this
giant 8 inch tablet it's just super
innovative and super cool and we're
really excited to see that phone later
this year now we've got a company that
we don't actually see that often MWC
this is Microsoft with the hololens 2
and this is more targeted towards
enterprise customers but what's pretty
interesting about this is they've been
able to expand the field of view that
you can actually see the AR scene in
last year we tested out the original
hololens and what was really cool he
only had a small field of view that you
were actually able to kind of experience
the AR environment and now it's a lot
bigger they made it a lot easier to wear
it is back loaded instead of front
loaded so it feels more even on your
face and you can flip it up kind of like
a welding mask so that's a little bit
fun and it just makes it a little bit
more comfortable and next we got another
phone it wouldn't really be NWC without
talking about a ton of phones we've got
the Nokia 9 and this phone is really
crazy because it's got five cameras on
the back we've seen a lot of triple
camera setups at MBC 2019 but this has
five cameras three monochrome sensors in
two color sensors so if you're really
really into photography I think this is
gonna be a really interesting device the
next thing isn't even really a product
but it is an innovation from Oppo
they've made this new thing that is a
10x optical zoom using a periscope and
you're actually able to put this in
smartphone cameras now they didn't say
what the next phone that is going to use
this is but we did get to test it out a
little bit and it's actually really
impressive you can zoom in without
pretty much losing any detail it's not
using a eye it is purely optical zoom
moving now the device list we've got
another phone from Sony this is the Sony
spiria one and the big news about this
phone is that is moving to a 21 by 9
aspect ratio that is a cinema-like
aspect ratio which you would kind of
expect from Sony because there this
company that is all about making TVs all
about making cameras and we haven't
really been able to use the device that
much yet but we are getting a review
unit coming soon in just a quick note
that our MWC coverage is brought to you
by digit daily your daily dose of text
straight to your inbox check out the
description below to learn more next
we've got the Samsung Galaxy S 10 and of
course it was announced at unpacked 2019
just a few days ago we're actually using
it right now we are reviewing this phone
so far it is really really nice it's got
the Snapdragon 855 pretty much
everything you've come to expect from
Samsung a headphone jack ip68 water
resistance we're really excited to show
you our final thoughts on this phone so
stay tuned for that now we've got the
huawei mate book X Pro and we saw this
last year it was also called the mate
book X Pro but what they've done this
year is pretty much refreshed it they've
added a new CPU they've added a new GPU
from Nvidia and they've kind of added
these different little software features
like being able to swipe down on the
screen with three fingers to take a
screenshot as well as adding Thunderbolt
three four-lane ports to all of the USB
C ports so you can actually attach an e
GPU to this and get the full throughput
of a GPU moving now the device list
we've got the Samsung Galaxy colt this
is Samsung's answer to the foldable
smartphone problem and we still haven't
really got to see how this phone folds
and unfolds there are a couple
promotional videos talking about it we
haven't actually been able to touch it
yet and we really really want to do that
we'll probably be getting it in the next
couple of months it comes out in April
so make sure you stay tuned for that and
I've got the xiaomi a 20 watt wireless
charging pad and this is pretty exciting
it's actually just an accessory that was
announced with the me 9 but the reason I
say exciting is because this is pretty
much the highest Wow wireless charging
pad that we've seen so far and a lot of
people are releasing hiwatt chargers
like while we released a 55 watt charger
that pairs with the huawei mate X but to
get a high watt wireless charging pad is
really exciting because that means that
you can actually finally start charging
your phone pretty quickly just by
wireless charging it
next week sets these Xiaomi me mix three
5g and this is interesting because we
actually saw the me mix three come out a
few months ago but now they've added 5g
to the phone and they've added a
Snapdragon 855 so that makes this like a
better phone but the big deal here is
that show me is actually making this
only a couple hundred dollars more and
even less than two hundred dollars more
than the original me mix three so we're
really excited that you're going to be
able to get 5g technology at a
relatively low price especially when
most manufacturers are jacking up the
price of all these phones just by adding
five to you to them so that was the
absolute best stuff that we saw here at
MWC 2019 thank you for coming along with
us for all of our coverage here I hope
you enjoyed it we have a ton more stuff
coming in the future there's all these
phones aren't going to start releasing
over the next couple months so we got
review after review after review coming
so make sure you stay tuned to both the
website and our YouTube channel and I
will catch you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
