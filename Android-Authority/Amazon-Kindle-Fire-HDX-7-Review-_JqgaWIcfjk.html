line of Android tablets and we wanted to
take a look at the latest one in their
offerings hey it's Josh regard
management authority what's going on
everybody and this is the Amazon Kindle
Fire HDX whereas plenty of us might
remember the Kindles of old that were
originally for just reading ebooks the
Kindle Fire series was Amazon's foray
into the full-featured tablet space so
what we're looking at here is a
seven-inch slate with a rather unique
and quite rigid form the screen is
surrounded by a pretty sizable bezel
that might not be the most attractive
but does have a very important function
when doing just about any kind of
content consumption being able to rest a
thumb easily on the side definitely
helps the sides actually have a bit of a
slant to them
that you'll notice most when plugging in
the microUSB charger or headphones in
the jack on the opposite side around the
back you'll see how this slanting motif
continues the entire tablet somewhat
rises up like the bottom of a pyramid
and meets the soft touch backing with
the Amazon logo on it the slants upward
on the sides are what house the buttons
and they are actually easy to find by
just feeling for them the top slants is
the only part that is not made up of a
soft touch plastic and houses the dual
speakers just by looking at the back you
can see that this tablet is generally
supposed to be used in landscape mode
making it easy to press the various
buttons and of course to help media
consumption I find the soft touch
plastic a great move on Amazon's part as
it isn't all that slippery and
definitely gives the tablet a nice look
when using the HDX
in landscape mode with two hands the
buttons are easy to find and if you're
used to reading in portrait mode the
tablet is still easily gripa belen one
hand all in all it's a simple pretty
elegant and definitely functional form
factor that you'll get in the Kindle
Fire HDX an IPS screen Grace's the
Kindle Fire HDX and is a great performer
at 7 inches this display is capable of
1920 by 1200 resolution at 323 PPI it is
really no surprise that the premium
offering by Amazon is packing this kind
of display because much of what you'll
be doing on the screen is watching and
reading media and in that regard this
screen really does all of it justice
high brightness is typical of IPS
screens and the HDX is capable of
viewing even in daylight reading Kindle
books on the HDX
as easy as it can be with the good pixel
density keeping text looking crisp and
sharp all videos you might watch from
your Prime subscription really pop
through nicely as colors are vibrant and
the contrast is high fire up some HD
content and it won't be hard to see all
of the details
all in all Amazon did well to put a very
high quality display on the HDX
and it provides a very enjoyable
experience but it wasn't just in the
screen that Amazon looked to really
excel as the Kindle Fire HDX also comes
with the current fastest processing
package available the Snapdragon 800
clocked in at 2.2 gigahertz and the
audrina 330 power the pretty simplistic
but very smooth fire OS and makes the
HDX a handy little gaming device if
Amazon tablets weren't quite on your
radar before you'll be pleasantly
surprised at the kind of power this one
is packing while smooth transitions are
mostly a software feature there is still
no denying that you're able to blaze
through pretty much anything in the fire
OS for a device that is very dependent
on the cloud the Kindle Fire HDX doesn't
come with too many extra bells and
whistles 16 32 or 64 gigabytes of
on-board storage are available but not
expandable 64 gigabytes is probably the
ideal here because HD versions of movies
you may buy on Amazon take up a ton of
space there is no rear facing camera but
the front-facing 1.3 megapixel shooter
helps for maybe just the occasional
selfie and for some video chatting while
there are versions of the HDX that can
work on mobile carriers this version has
Wi-Fi atop Bluetooth and GPS
functionality so that leaves the
speakers and the battery first off the
battery is a pretty large 45 50 milli
amp hour unit that provides a very good
deal of longevity Amazon claims 11 hours
of usage and in my testing it feels just
about right going from 50 percent to 20
percent took me about three hours of
mostly video viewing which falls pretty
much in line and finally the dual
speakers at the top of the Kindle Fires
back provide an experience backed by
dolby enhancements having those
enhancements can drain battery life
faster so that's going to be your call
to turn him on I have to say that I was
actually really surprised at the sound
quality coming out of this 7-inch tablet
the binge-watching I mentioned earlier
was done without headphones as a matter
of fact I had to leave the volume below
half level because they are quite loud
but what was most impressive is how much
dimension the
was to the sound ambient noises in the
videos or let's say audience laughter
really does sound separated from the
main subjects in the video and the two
speakers handle left and right channels
beautifully
headphones and Bluetooth speakers will
still work as they should but if you
don't have any of these things on hand
the HDX can definitely still stand on
its own all right we get into the crux
of this review which is the software in
Amazon's fire OS if you came to this
review thinking Amazon and Android
didn't immediately feel like they fit
together there is actually good reason
for this this is because fire OS is
quite literally a version foreign beyond
what we might be used to from let's say
a stock experience like on the Nexus 7
Amazon took the very bare essentials and
stripped Google services and motifs away
replacing them with a carousel home
screen that lists your most recent apps
below them is a grid of your installed
applications and then up top or portals
for various Amazon content actually
there isn't too much after that
the darker motif permeates the menus and
notification drop-down and ultimately
the simplistic style lends itself to a
very snappy minimalistic user interface
what you see is essentially what you get
but it isn't all that bad and no this
version of Android does not come with
Google specific services like maps or
even Gmail which may be a turn-off for
anyone that relies on them I certainly
missed my google play music the Amazon
versions of calendar and email work well
even if they're not really full-featured
and if you really need to access Google
services the web-based versions work
well enough especially YouTube the
Amazon Appstore ecosystem is actually
quite robust providing a good selection
of applications that you'd find in the
Play Store Facebook feedly and Evernote
were all there so I was happy but
anything that was missing however could
still be side-loaded sideloading apps is
completely supported by the Kindle Fire
and most applications you install should
work fine on this tablet it's when you
get into the portals that the Kindle
Fire really opens up they're really
everything you may have purchased or
could want is listed making content
buying downloading and streaming really
easy it's clear that you should be a
prime subscriber to get the most out of
your Kindle Fire and you get a free
month with your purchase with Prime you
have a slew of content available
immediately for free so enjoying content
is as easy as finding your show or movie
paying the rental or owning price if
necessary and pressing play the same
goes for everything from books to
magazines to music one pretty awesome
enhancement in video watching is the X
ray feature which gives you a bar on the
left side
that lists all actors fun facts and
trivia about the scene you are currently
on I'm sure that film buffs will
definitely get a kick out of that
free time is perfect for parents who
want to limit their kids time on their
device it was a little weird that I had
to fabricate a child but once setup and
gave my non-existent daughter only one
and a half hours on apps Facebook and
unlimited time reading you can set any
and all content on the Kindle to be used
in a free time profile the minimalistic
version of which will come up when you
activate it any attempt to change the
settings or exit free time requires a
password that I have to set up it is
worth mentioning that all children's
content on Amazon can be accessed for
$2.99 per child consisting of a lot of
hand-picked content by Amazon that would
make it easier for parents to find such
things rather than sifted through a full
Prime subscription after that is the
very unique and honestly pretty crazy
new feature of the Mayday button this
can be called the revolution in customer
service as all you have to do to get
your questions answered is roll down the
notification shade and hit the Mayday
button what I'm pleased to report is
that it works just about as well as the
commercial show while the internet
connection might make your experience
very I got connected to a gentleman in
the 15-second promised wait time the
video and audio quality coming from the
customer service rep was very good and
it was not hard at all to get whatever
information I wanted the rep is able to
see your content on your screen the
entire time draw on it to illustrate
your points and take control of the
screen if need be it's a wonderful way
for anyone who needs help to get help so
if you know anyone who is
technologically challenged even on the
pretty easy to use Kindle Fire
admittedly Mayday is still definitely
there to help and it works pretty damn
well all right so what do you have to
pay to get one of the fastest tablets
around that most good speakers battery
life in a pretty incredible customer
service feature
well this 7-inch condition of the HDX
starts at two hundred and twenty nine
dollars for the 16 gigabyte model Wi-Fi
only and without special offers included
special offers is Amazon's advertising
system that turns your idle Kindle Fire
into an ad space it costs an extra
fifteen dollars to have a version
without the special offers but to be
honest it isn't actually all that
intrusive
and so there you have it a somewhat
surprisingly great offering from Amazon
whose highly customized and
stripped-down version of Android is
backed up by what can be considered a
top executed Hardware package it might
be a sore spot for Google reliant users
that much of their Android applications
are not included but with a little extra
effort much of what you miss could still
be installed well you do get in the
Kindle Fire HDX is a smooth capable and
easy to use hub connecting you to the
immense Amazon network it just might be
one of the best ways to enjoy TV movies
and books available in the Android space
and if you run into trouble a simple
press of the button can save you from it
