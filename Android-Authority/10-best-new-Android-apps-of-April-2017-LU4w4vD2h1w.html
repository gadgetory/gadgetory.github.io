hindi the android authority app guy and
it's about that time of the month to
round out the best new android apps that
were released in april of 2017 if you
want to check out any of these
applications for yourself you can find
those links in the video description
below
glassware helps you keep track of your
data it shows you a real-time graph that
shows how much data that you've used the
applications that use it and a whole lot
more its most useful for those who have
a limited data cap and want to keep
track of how much they've used however
it's also an excellent way to see the
apps that access your network the most
often and how often they do it you can
even have glass fire alert you whatever
a specific app accesses data it's free
to download with no in-app purchases if
you're interested Libbie is an ebook and
audiobook platform by overdrive labs it
works by using your library card to let
you borrow content for free you simply
sign up with your library card and the
entire platform is open to you it
features thousands of e-books and
audiobooks to choose from and you can
download books for offline viewing write
books and a whole lot more overdrive
Labs has an official application that
does a lot of these other things
however Libbey aims to be a more
simplified experience it's also free and
has no in-app purchases to do is
Microsoft's latest app it is a to-do
list
application with a simple design and
simple function that allows you to
create a list of things that you need to
do and then it syncs them between your
PC and your Android device you can
create tasks add reminders and make
tasks recur like taking out the garbage
every week and then create new lists to
help keep yourself organized it looks
and works a lot like wonder list except
for its way more simplified its
currently completely free to download
and use the only caveat is you have to
sign in to your Microsoft account in
order to use it
movie Pal is a social app for movie
watchers the basic idea is that it helps
you keep track of what movies you've
seen and the ones you want to watch you
can then create groups and invite
friends to share in the movie watching
fun you can also add movies to a watch
list and when you've seen it you mark
the movie as scene and it will no longer
show up in search results that way you
can always get a fresh list of movies
that you've never seen before it's free
to download and use there is some
advertising but it's not really that bad
outdoor family fun with Klum is a new
application from PBS
kids the idea is to give kids something
to do that gets them out of the house
some of the stuff we found was taking
selfies with trees counting dogs and
passing cars and observing the weather
it boasts 150 total activities tips to
help kids learn about science and even a
progress tracker to see how you're doing
the design is fun and it should be easy
to use even for most kids best of all
it's totally free with no in-app
purchases
Podcast co is a good simple podcast app
it features a colorful modern design and
it's fairly easy to use it boasts a
collection of over 300,000 podcasts
across a variety of genres and you can
subscribe to them download episodes and
listen offline it is missing the
occasional feature that podcasts fans
are likely used to however those people
are likely using more powerful podcast
apps already it's a good simple app for
the casual podcast fan it's also free
with no in-app purchases there are a few
ads though run tasty is a new cooking
application from runtastic it aims to
provide healthy meal ideas without being
too restrictive it features over 40
recipes that include options for vegans
vegetarians gluten-free and other
dietary restrictions each recipe is
accompanied by a step-by-step video to
show you how to make it the recipes can
be organized based on how long they take
to cook how many calories they have and
other filters it's currently free to use
but we expect runtastic to improve the
selection and probably add some paid
options over time today weather is a
relatively newer weather app that boasts
a minimal design most of the basic
weather app features and even tons of
weather photos to explore the features
include access to the current weather
future forecasts air quality and UV
graphs severe weather alerts and other
useful info you can even take your own
photos to add to the apps UI if you want
to you can get most of the features for
free or unlock everything with the $3.99
price tag there are cheaper options if
you go for a subscription but the full
price tag is the best deal wallet hub is
a financial application and it allows
people to check their credit scores it's
very simple in scope to an application
like Credit Karma along with your daily
updated credit score you'll get credit
improving tips credit monitoring and a
whole lot more it'll also show you
savings alerts for financial products
but that's likely also their advertising
strategy it's not really bothersome so
it's really nothing to worry about
the design is decent enough and it's
useful for
anybody it's very used with no in-app
purchases YouTube TV is the latest
online television service to hit the
world at its launch it was only
available in five areas although more
coverage has been promised soon it has a
decent design and unlimited cloud-based
DVR and each account can be shared with
up to six people of course it also has
chromecast support and integration with
YouTube Bret originals it's not fast to
the price although it's lack of
availability has slowed the hypetrain
considerably keep an eye on this one in
the long term and that about does it for
this one folks don't forget to subscribe
and ring the bell to get the latest
android authority videos as soon as we
release them as usual if you want to
check out any of these applications we
do have them linked up in the video
description below for your convenience
as always thank you for watching
everybody
and have a wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
