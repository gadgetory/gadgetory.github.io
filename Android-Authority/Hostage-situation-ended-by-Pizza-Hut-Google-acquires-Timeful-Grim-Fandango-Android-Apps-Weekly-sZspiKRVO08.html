brought to you by cube x hello again
ladies and gentlemen I'm Joe Hindy the
android authority app guy and welcome
back to android apps weekly this week's
headlines feature pizza and other stuff
the latest Humble Bundle came out this
last week and it features some great
games you can pay whatever you want and
get the last express space team and tilt
to live to if you beat the average you
can also have Monument Valley black and
joe danger it's a cheap way to get some
great games and give to charity Google
is currently testing a new method of
converting website so that they load
four times faster and consume eighty
percent less data this is great news for
people in countries like India and
Indonesia where data connections aren't
so good and it'll help the rest of us a
little bit too google has also
officially acquired an application
called time full time full is an
application that combines to-do lists
calendar and scheduling all in one place
and then tries to help people get it all
done ostensibly Google will be using
this in their own products to make them
smarter everyone remembers snake the
classic mobile game that used to come on
old cell phones the original creator has
announced that he is launching a sequel
called snake rewind to the Google Play
Store we don't have an exact release
date but it'll be out sometime this
month in our last bit of news this week
a woman got out of a hostage situation
by ordering a pizza she convinced her
attacker to let her order some pizza for
her kids and use the special
instructions box in the Pizza Hut
application to ask them to phone for
help everyone made it out okay and the
hostage taker is now in jail awesome to
see the rest of the android apps and
games headlines news releases and
updates don't forget to check out this
week's newsletter which is linked in the
video description below we have a lot
more stuff in there that we couldn't fit
into the show Andrew Birley Friday if
you want to you can also subscribe to it
using your email address and we'll beam
it straight to your inbox every single
Friday okay folks let's take a look at
the applications that made a big splash
this week goatse is essentially a
mash-up of goat simulator and daisy
you'll play the totally realistic life
of a goat as you battle zombies and try
not to get run over by cars or you might
be trying to get run over by cars either
way is a goofy and fun little game that
includes a crafting system a large map
zombies and of course the usual mayhem
that comes from these sorts of games
it's four dollars and ninety-nine
since but there are no in-app purchases
google chrome eventually gets updated in
chrome beta get some stuff sooner but if
you really want the bleeding edge of
what Google is working on right now then
you want the chrome dev channel app it
is a web browser where Google tests out
the latest features patches and fixes
before it heads out anywhere else there
will almost certainly be bugs but it's a
lot of fun if you're into seeing what
Google has cooking right now if you're a
fan of SNL then you'll definitely want
to pick up their new official
application the app features the ability
to watch all kinds of old sketches
highlights from the current season and
the lineup of upcoming hosts you can
search for old clubs by season episode
or by the cast members that were in them
it'll also recommend other sketches
based on what you like there's even some
exclusive content available like I said
all fans should have this applications
like meerkat and periscope have been
making headlines for their ease of use
and ability to stream anything now the
meerkat application is live in the
Google Play Store although it is in beta
right now it allows you to stream live
video from your smartphone camera to
Twitter you can also get notified of
other people streaming if you follow
them and they use meerkat it's totally
free but again it is a beta so do beware
of the bugs last up this week Double
Fine released a remastered version of
the PC cult classic Grim Fandango it's
pretty much the same game fans will
remember but now on mobile with a few
enhancements like a revamp soundtrack
developer commentary and new graphics
the game is on sale right now for nine
dollars and ninety-nine cents there are
some released a bug so buyer beware but
those should be straightened out
sometime soon thanks again for watching
everybody but let's get down to some
serious business cubex is a puzzle game
that employs a unique spin on the game
of Tetris instead of controlling the
blocks and where they follow you instead
control the platform that they fall on
blocks can come from both the bottom and
the top and you can engage in various
game modes to challenge yourself it's a
bit difficult at first but quite
enjoyable once you get used to it it's
also totally free with no in-app
purchases and we'd like to thank cube X
for their support of Android apps weekly

authority app guy why you're here why
