what's going on everybody and this is
the matchup that many of you have been
waiting for Samsung's newest and
greatest versus HTC's best yeah this is
the samsung galaxy s4 vs the HTC One
design on the galaxy s4 was always
doomed to come down to this you are
either cool with or absolutely hate the
plastic material and feel what is
incredible about the s4 however is that
for having a 5-inch screen it feels
almost exactly the same as the s3 it is
even thinner and a little lighter the
HTC One has gotten praise for its
aluminium body and is certainly one of
the best looking smart phones available
the body comes around the 4.7 inch
screen and makes the phone shine quite
literally the feel it's pretty much the
same on both as the full devices are
around the same size I do really love
the HTC One sleek and industrious
profile but I cannot deny Samsung their
feet of making the best-handling 5-inch
screen device out now I'm forced to give
this one a tie size does matter in the
display category the samsung galaxy s4
definitely has the edge by having a
little more screen with a total five
inches it is the very saturated Super
AMOLED technology that makes colors
really pop viewing angles are great on
the s4 as you can still see elements of
the screen even at the steepest angles
the HTC one's LCD display is capable of
the very same but it is a little smaller
see I'm all about the 5-inch screen
especially one as good as this so the
galaxy s4 narrowly gets the display
point performance on either of these
devices will please anyone you'll be
zipping through either blinkfeed or
TouchWiz with absolutely no problems
that is because the Snapdragon 600
processor powers dates flagships the n2
to score draws the line however as the
HTC One clock cnet 1.7 gigahertz and
scores a little lower than the 1.9
gigahertz powerhouse found in the galaxy
s4 in terms of raw numbers the s4 just
barely gets the point but come on either
very interior will bring you a lot of
wonderful speed and enjoyment it's no
secret that the galaxy s4 comes with a
bevy of new bits and pieces mainly in
sensors see the full review for a
comprehensive list but I will mention
the info
sensor for air gestures a gyroscope for
pedometer abilities and a sensitive
screen that converts your finger into an
S Pen not to mention the ability to
remove that back cover and gain access
to the replaceable battery and SD card
slot the s4 really does offer quite a
lot the HTC one on the other hand
doesn't offer nearly as much as the s4
but has a couple aces in the hole we'll
get to the camera in a bit but boomsound
beckons these front-facing speakers are
spectacular performers and make the HTC
One a nice little sound system
I love boomsound but I have to admit
that the practicality of expandable
memory and replaceable batteries as well
as the fun you can have due to all those
sensors does put the s4 on top battery
life favors the galaxy s4 because of
that removable battery but also it has a
higher capacity at 2600 milliamp hours
which Trump's the non removable 2300
battery in the HTC one now the camera
situation is very interesting on the one
hand you have samsung success with the
s3s 8 megapixel shooter returning with
the very good 13 megapixel performer in
the s4 not only are the optics better
but the app has been given a lot of new
features like eraser and drama modes
with very good quality you have a ton of
ways to get your shot on the other hand
the HTC One decided to forego the
megapixel count and focus the quality on
only four without the many different
modes the s4 can boast low-light
performance turns out to be the
ultrapixels main attribute the galaxy s4
might give you a lot of ways of getting
your shot but the ultrapixels actually
do their job even if the picture from
the HTC One is a lot smaller I can't
deny their quality so because both of
these cameras fulfill particular needs I
will give them both the point and
finally we get to the software in one
corner you have TouchWiz the over the
top samsung UI that is uber colorful and
that times can seem a little crowded I
was never really a fan until I saw how
it worked on a 5-inch screen the
flamboyant you I actually works well for
this 1080p display throw in a number of
new navigation abilities like air
gesture and air view health monitoring
via s health and even smart scrolling
and pausing and you have an OS capable
of a great deal of cool things and in
the other corner is sense which has
gotten a lot of flak in the past for its
spaced out design but sense 5
revitalizes HTC's you I with a better
coat of polish and blinkfeed in addition
to the home screens that consolidates
social media and news outlets into one
easy to navigate panel it's a great
addition that I actually used a lot more
than I thought I would if the HTC One
was rocking an earlier version of sense
it would have lost right away but i have
to give blinkfeed credit for taking up
quite a bit of my time TouchWiz finally
looks all right to me and its editions
are quite fun to use I will give this
one a tie because too
be honest I have fun and get things done
with either one now pricing on both
flagships will likely be around the two
hundred dollar mark for two year
contracts in the u.s. otherwise the HTC
one unlocked actually comes in at the
cheaper price of around five hundred and
seventy five dollars compared to the
seven hundred dollar unlocked price of
the s4 if price is a big deal to you you
really can't go wrong saving a little
bit of money on all that HTC's beast has
to offer and so there you have it the
galaxy s4 does take the win in this
versus primarily because Samsung really
packed in a lot of features into its
phone it really is a device of choice
you might not use all of the new
features but they are there for you
nonetheless HTC went a little bit
simpler and focused on hardware design
boomsound is an amazing addition and I
do have to admit that blinkfeed is a
hugely positive direction for sense
ultimately the unlocked price dictates
the battle here the samsung's larger
screen and more robust future list do
make it pricier than the still wonderful
HTC One and for a lot of people it's
going to come down to just these two
phones but given the quality of either
device isn't having that choice pretty
awesome don't forget to subscribe to our
