Android authority you're watching our
video review of the Mizzou Pro 7 plus
the pro 7 plus is really just a little
bit better than the pro 6 plus so a lot
of what we said in that review also
applies here
well there is one big change and you
already know what it is it's the
secondary display basically amazing I
slapped down a 1.9 inch AMOLED display
on the back of the phone so what does it
do well there are three main information
panels that you can swipe between time
pedometer and weather if you swipe up or
down on any of the information panels
you get to the viewfinder mode here you
can take considerably higher quality
selfies with the rear cameras in
addition to these on-demand core
features the screen also shows things
like new notification event times and
titles and alarms you can activate the
screen by either turning the phone
around or by double tapping on the glass
it's really nice to see meizu seriously
innovate with this secondary screen of
course just like with any first
generation technology there is a room
for improvement the good news is is that
the hardware implementation is great
it's just the software that could use
some work in the meantime the secondary
screen just doesn't add much functional
value it's still a very cool feature
though and you'll enjoy it for its
uniqueness and all the conversations
that help start flip the phone over and
you'll see the 5.7 inch quad HD Super
AMOLED primary display and boy is it a
beauty coveri production viewing angles
sunlight readability they're all great
it's an all-around excellent display we
really enjoyed the size to 5.5 inches is
a great middle ground but it's nice that
May's it was giving you the choice
between a smaller 5.2 inches with the
pro 7 and a larger 5.7 inches with the
pro 7 plus if you're going to go with
the larger model you'll especially want
to consider using a case Mesa includes a
plastic one on the box and for good
reason the soft aluminum unibody while
very premium makes the phone quite
slippery thankfully the superb build
quality should make any drops a tad more
forgiving you can choose between a
number of attractive color options when
getting the pro 7 plus or
quite happy with how the matte-black
looks and recommend it if you prefer a
minimal look it's a very clean design
overall from the discrete antenna lines
to the flush curved and cornered
secondary display glass smaller details
like the integrated light and proximity
sensors in the earpiece and symmetrical
top and bottom bezels further solidify
mazes keen attention to detail there's
really only one big design flaw and
that's a lack of water and dust
protection that's pretty typical at this
price but if it's something you want
know that you can spend just a little
bit more to get it one of our favorite
aspects of mazes smartphones is their
single key navigation configurations so
instead of a three key layout like
you're probably used to and touch on the
pro 7 plus lets you navigate as well as
nothing to gate with fingerprints with a
single button for navigation you just
tap it to go back press it to go home
and swipe up from the neighboring bezel
to multitask this setup can take a day
or two to get used to what you'll end up
loving it you'll also love the low key
excellent audio setup you can get loud
and clear 32-bit - I do with the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack no headphones
no problem the bottom firing speaker is
actually really good it's very loud with
minimal Distortion
one of the nice things about Mesa phones
is that they're all unlocked and dual
SIM so you can use two different nanos
since simultaneously with the pro seven
plus just don't plan on using them in
the US as it doesn't have proper band
support for either AT&amp;amp;T or t-mobile if
you think you're going to need more than
the base metal 64 gigabytes of internal
storage you want to go with the 128
gigabyte model is there's no expandable
storage option the pro 7 plus is packing
a 3,500 milliamp hour battery and it
offer a similar longevity to the pro 6
plus our tests were conducted over HSPA+
instead of LTE so please note that our
numbers may be a Chad inflated on
average we got about 5 and a half hours
of screen on time we are a bit concerned
with a high standby usage possibly due
to the helio x30
still you can probably expect around
four and a half hours of screen on time
with a full day of moderate use when you
inevitably do need to tap on you can do
so with M charge 4.0 we were able to go
from zero to 65 percent in just 30
minutes that makes the pro 7 plus
the fastest charging phones available
standard a performance is excellent -
although only marginally better than the
pro six pluses it's using media Tech's
flagship Helio X 30 10 nanometer chip
but that's not the whole story the six
gigabytes of RAM fast ufs 2.1 storage
and well optimized software also help
ensure smooth performance maizes
software changes extend greatly into the
foreground - well the pro 7 plus runs
android 7.1.1 nougat maces fly me six
skin offers a unique user experience fly
me isn't for everyone but it's one of
the most well designed Android skins to
date and is great if you're looking to
try something a bit different
slimey's clean design fun animations and
extra features are commendable you can
expect a very intuitive user experience
UI is colorful bold and responsive
there's also a strong level of
consistency in mazes design language
throughout the software from the menus
to the system apps we also really like
how fly me includes some extra security
features for example there's a secure
payment mode which temporarily makes
some common sense changes while you're
using an app like PayPal there is
something to keep in mind about the
software though since maze of system
updates focus on changes to fly me more
so than Android versions it is slightly
unlikely that the pro 7 plus will be
updated to Android 8.0 Oreo we
understand how this lack of Android
support might be a turn-off for some for
the cameras we're working with two sony
IMX 386 12 megapixel f 2.0 shooters one
for RGB and another for monochrome
that's one more camera than the pro 6
plus head but the pro 7 plus does lose a
few features there's no more laser
autofocus the 10 LED ring flash has been
replaced by 2 LEDs and most
significantly there's no longer any
optical image stabilization sample
images came out pretty similar to those
taken by the pro 6 plus the color
reproduction is excellent there's a good
level of contrast and images are very
detailed it's about what we expect at
this price although we do miss OAS as it
would have prevented some of our sample
images from coming out a bit blurry this
time around Mesa has implemented a dual
lens blur mode this mode works by
isolating the subject from the
background and then by applying an
artificial background
sometimes it does a good job at doing so
other times the edges aren't totally
accurate and the amount of blur can be
too much or too sudden we're hoping that
Mesa will improve this feature with
future software updates
unfortunately low-light performance
isn't quite as impressive as daytime as
you can see colors aren't as punchy
there's a loss of detail and there's a
fair bit of digital noise it's fine
considering the price but it could be
better in case you are wondering there's
still a 16 megapixel F 2.0 front-facing
camera for standard selfies and video
calls selfies come out quite nicely but
keep in mind that you can always use the
better quality rear cameras instead
thanks to that secondary display 4k
video recorded with the pro 7 plus also
comes out quite nicely colors look
pretty good and there's a good level of
detail one of the nice features from the
pro 6 plus that has made its way to the
pro 7 plus is the ability to double
press the home button to access the
camera even when the phone is locked as
far as the camera app goes it's a pretty
standard setup so meizu pro 7 plus how
much does it cost
well the global unit should retail for
around five hundred thirty dollars the
smaller pro seven will be slightly less
expensive at four hundred thirty dollars
this is easily one of the most unique
smart phones that we've reviewed this
year Mizzou not only managed to deliver
a great overall package but has also
implemented a very cool-looking
secondary display which helps the pro
Soudan plus standout but you shouldn't
buy this phone just for the secondary
display
well it's useful at times it's still
very much a first-generation concept you
should think of it as a bonus item
rather than a sole reason for your
purchase that's not to say the pro suom
Plus isn't worth the money in fact it's
well designed software an excellent
hardware make it very competitive if
you're looking for something genuinely
unique I can get past its quirks the pro
cylinder plus is an excellent choice and
