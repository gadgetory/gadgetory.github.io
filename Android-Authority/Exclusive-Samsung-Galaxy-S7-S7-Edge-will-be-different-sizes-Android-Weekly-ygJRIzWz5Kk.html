the size of a device is this is going to
matter too many of you we have an
exclusive that says the Galaxy s7 will
be the same size as the s6 but the s7
edge will be a little bit bigger thanks
to Israeli journalist shy mizrachi who
partnered up with android authority to
give you this exclusive we can now
confirm that Samsung has decided that
the Galaxy s7 edge will have a larger
5.5 inch screen compared to the Galaxy
s7 which will support a 5.2 inch screen
this isn't stark contrast to last year
where both phones had 5.1 inch displays
second we can also revealed that the
back of each device should be similar to
the galaxy note 5 and the s6 edge+ where
the former features a flat display and
curved rear and the latter has the
opposite it's likely that Samsung will
keep the metal and glass build used in
this year's handsets and this should
mean that the curved rear and the Galaxy
s7 will make it easier to hold so is the
size difference between the s7 and the
s7 edge going to matter to you let me
know in the comments below and those of
you who are looking forward to the LG g5
will be happy to know that will likely
have a secondary ticker display
according to popular leaker Evan Blass
aka evleaks reading for ventureBeat the
LG g5 will sport a number of interesting
design changes that we didn't really
expect would be featured on LG's first
flagship 2016 device sourcing people
familiar with the matter the LG g5 will
supposedly sport a metal chassis that
borrows elements from the g series
devices as well as the v10 the company's
most recent flagship it will come with a
5.3 inch display with a quad HD
resolution as well as a secondary ticker
display similar to what was featured on
the v10 vent repeat says the secondary
display will be one of the lg's headline
features across its 2016 lineup it's
also rumored to be powered by the
brand-new Qualcomm Snapdragon 820
processor along with 3 gigabytes of ram
32 gigabytes of on-board storage in
addition while the v10 utilizes dual
cameras on the front of the device the
g5 will sport dual camera lenses on the
back giving the supposed 16 megapixel
rear camera 135 degree wide angle
capability remember Google glass really
cool or just really geeky well for many
people especially
the media it was just too board-like but
that hasn't stopped mother Google from
carrying on google has a new version of
google glass aimed at enterprise
customers called google glass Enterprise
Edition this new handset is said to
support a faster processor made by Intel
a larger prism display an improved
battery life for starters the headset
now features a hinge on the right side
of the glass that can be folded up and
tucked away without taking as much space
this was a huge gripe of the first
generation hardware so we're happy to
see this feature has been included there
are also other improvements including a
larger prism display and a front light
that turns on when the cameras in use
the power button has also been moved
from the inside to the back of the
device and you'll be happy to know that
the Xiaomi me 5 has been spotted with
video the leaked pictures show off the
me 5 and a variety of colors including
black gold pink and white the phone
appears to have taken on a more curved
design than the me for with slightly
rounded corners and an oval-shaped home
button which reportedly houses a new
fingerprint scanner I love the galaxy 6
the previously rumoured 2.5 d curved
glass display and the 3d glass back
panel also seems to make an appearance
previous hardware specifications have
pinned the Xiaomi me five on a quad-core
Snapdragon 820 processor 4 gigabytes of
RAM a 5.2 inch quad HD display 16
megapixel rear camera and an 8 megapixel
front-facing camera the phone is also
said to come with 16 gigabytes or 64
gigabytes of internal storage and a 3030
milliamp hour battery a me 5 plus
version of the phone with a 5.5 inch or
5.7 inch display has also been rumoured
which may account for the slightly wider
look handset model in the video the
shell maybe five is rumored to cost
around 2,500 one or three hundred and
ninety dollars u.s. when it finally
launches which would make the smartphone
quite a bargain thanks for watching
android army my name is Jace love to
