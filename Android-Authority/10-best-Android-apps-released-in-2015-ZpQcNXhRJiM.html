johanna the android authority app guy
we're nearing the end of december which
means it's time to round up the best
android apps of 2015 dobe long ago
promised that they would take Android a
lot more seriously and they definitely
proved it in 2015 they released a ton of
applications including Lightroom mobile
capture CC illustrator draw Photoshop
mix shape CC brush CC and color CC these
applications all have a range of
functionality from photo editing
advanced photo editing illustration
design and other creation tools you'd be
hard-pressed to find a better suite of
tools for designers photographers and
other creative types and they're all
free to use Apple music may not be what
Android fans want to see on this list
but it actually is a pretty decent
little service it boasts 30 million
songs radio stations live radio and a
bunch of content it competes
head-to-head with the likes of Spotify
and Google Play Music in terms of
content available although individual
features may be more tempting based on
personal taste
in either case that is one more awesome
option that people have for streaming
music the application itself still needs
work but we assume Apple will eventually
take care of that after a long wait
Cortana landed on Android in early
December Microsoft's cross-platform
virtual assistant now gives Android
users a second big choice aside from
Google now that can do things like put
stuff on your scheduled call and text
people and even tell jokes it's a long
way away from being complete and it's
been very well documented that the
application has some problems right now
but it is totally free to use and it's
almost certainly going to greatly
improve over the course of the next year
the Khan Academy is an online learning
resource that can help teach you things
or help you brush up on things that you
haven't studied in a while there are a
variety of subjects to check out
including math science economics history
and plenty of others in the application
you can watch videos about various
subjects and bookmark your favorite
content of course the phone and the site
sync up so you can almost always start
again where you left off learning is a
lifelong endeavor and this is a decent
application to help you keep going the
Cody is a media center application that
was once known as XBMC of course legal
things happen that caused the name
change but Cody is still the epic and
powerful media center app that it always
was before the official version was
released to the Google Play Store this
year and includes
full interface where you can browse your
TV shows music movies and a whole lot
more
there is also third-party plugins
support it is entirely open source and
it is completely free to use like the
developers we don't recommend using it
on smaller screens Microsoft Office took
its sweet time making it to Android but
it was well worth the wait
all the way back in January we saw the
applications released for tablets with
phone releases coming later on each
application is entirely free to use for
the most part and they're all extremely
solid and functional you can get more
features if you use an office 365
subscription but either way this is a
seriously powerful office suite and
we're happy to finally have it on
Android the periscope is one of the most
unique applications to come out this
year it allows pretty much anyone to
livestream what they're doing through
their phone camera and pretty much
anyone can watch the streams it's been a
favorite of bloggers web stars and even
one dude who periscope himself brushing
his teeth the name of the application
has already become a verb and that's how
you know you've done something special
in the software space sling TV made some
serious waves when it was released
earlier this year it's not the first
service to offer live-streaming TV but
it is among the first and among the
largest to offer it without an existing
cable subscription you can get about two
dozen channels with a basic subscription
with add-ons for things like sports or
kids channels at an additional cost the
application still needs some work but
the premise is amazing and we hope they
expand on it in 2016 Google spent a
great deal of time expanding YouTube
earlier this year they introduced
YouTube read a subscription service that
removes advertising and gives you
additional features they also released
YouTube kids YouTube gaming and YouTube
music these specialized versions of
YouTube take away the general
bric-a-brac and give you a leaner
collection of stuff that you might
actually want to search for they're all
free but can be enhanced with the APRA
mentioned subscription and each one
comes with their own set of unique
features week and our pick for the best
Android app released in 2015 is Google
photos this application changed the game
when it came to online photo storage
sharing and backup it provides free
unlimited photo and video storage as
long as you don't mind them reducing the
quality just a little bit there are also
a variety of sorting features editing
features sharing features and labeling
features that make this a truly powerful
application that literally everyone can
appreciate all right folks that about
does it for this video if you want to
check out any of these andr
we'll have those linked up for you in
the video description below also don't
