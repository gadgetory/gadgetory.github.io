have a couple of accessories made by HTC
that you might be interested in its
charge of a guard from Android thority
what's going on everybody
and here's our quick review of the HTC
view case and the HTC high-res earphones
now if you haven't seen our HTC 10
review just yet you can find it here at
the YouTube channel or you can head on
over to the written review at android
authority comm make sure you check it
out because we do think that the HTC 10
is a pretty beautiful phone but pretty
as it is the HTC 10 can use a little bit
of extra protection and that's what the
ice view case will be able to do it is a
variation or rather an evolution from
the original dot view cases that came
with the HTC One m8 and m9 you just slip
the phone into the main part of the
phone and if you have a particular color
it will still retain the original color
of your phone in this case the dark gray
is what we have and it will provide some
protection around the sides and for the
backing as well
yes you are going to be covering up the
beautiful metal construction that that
makes up the HTC 10 but at the very
least you'll be able to protect your
investment as far as handling goes it
does add just a little bit of girth to
this particular device and it also is a
little bit tough to use with just one
hand especially when you have to flip
the front cover open it's not too hard
to flip it open but then getting a nice
ergonomic feel out of it requires you to
probably just fold it all the way back
or just tuck it under one of your
fingers we didn't find this to be too
much of a problem but since the HTC 10
is a slightly wider phone than you might
be used to adding a case on it might
exacerbate the handling experience
nonetheless however pretty much
everything is exposed properly so you
can still use the phone even if the
cover is closed for example the
headphone jack up top and the USB type-c
port on the bottom are still properly
exposed as well as the phone speaker on
the front so when you take some calls
you will be able to hear them loud and
clear through the case double tap on the
screen when you have the phone propped
up and it will come up with a nice
looking screen that we actually believe
should be used as a lock screen for the
original HTC 10 experience nonetheless
however we do have the icon on the
bottom that if you do have a
notification you can swipe left and
right to see it and then swipe up in
order to see a little bit more
information about to that notification
and swiping down from here will dismiss
it from the ice view view but the main
addition in the ice view case this time
around is the ability to use the camera
even when the cover is closed swiping
down twice just like you would with the
original HTC 10 motion gestures allows
for the camera to appear and it comes
through the ice view case actually quite
well unfortunately in broad daylight
situations the glare will be enough to
make it so that you can't see the camera
through this cover but in most other
situations it's not all that bad the
main problem about using this camera
view through the ice view case however
is that it does tend to blur the entire
viewfinder it's not a very clear view of
the viewfinder and thus if you are in
let's say the pro mode you may not
necessarily know exactly what you are
changing in terms of the settings on the
viewfinder for the most part it's a
pretty easy way of getting a shot off
when you don't want to fiddle with the
case but you'd still have to open the
case up if you want to take selfies or
pretty much any picture using the
front-facing camera which is a little
bit annoying because it's kind of easy
to drop the entire device when you're
trying to fiddle with the cover that
gets in the way that said however the
design of the ice view case does allow
for a very unique perspective on what is
a smart cover for the HTC 10 we still
think that the screens you see through
the eyes view could make for a wonderful
lockscreen for the general HTC software
but that's something that we hope HTC
will figure out a little bit later on
but now we can move into the audio
experience with the HTC high res audio
earphones they do have the look of a
high-end earbud or an in-ear monitor and
that starts with the silicone tips that
sit very comfortably in the ear there
are other sizes that are included as
well if you need it to fit a little bit
better for a much better feel and then a
single button is found on the right ear
bud that also houses a microphone for
taking calls now taking calls with these
headphones has been a pretty good
experience we've had no issues with
anybody on either end of the call not
being able to hear anybody clearly but
you just have to plug in the earphones
and that's when the fun really begins
the boom sound enhancements in the HTC
10 will ask you a few questions and once
you answer them you'll have an audio
profile and you're ready to go turning
on pretty much any music makes for an
enjoyable experience and these
headphones are leaps and bounds better
than any bundled earphones you might
have gotten with a number of other smart
phones it's really in the low end that
this headphone does a great job the mids
are still pretty good and the highs
could use a little bit better clarity
but when you have these on and really
blast that volume it sounds like you're
in a club but it does so without really
muddying the lower m so it doesn't
really sound distorted a whole lot it
just sounds like pretty clear bass and
especially when it's really loud it
really booms
of course if you have your own pair of
headphones or earbuds or in your
monitors that will take advantage of the
boom sound enhancements then by all
means they will provide a great
experience in the HTC 10 but it's great
to see that a first party accessory is
being made to take advantage of what has
been one of the best audio experiences
on a smart phone we've had so far
the HTC ice view case for the HTC 10 is
available for $49.99 on the HTC website
right now that is at least what it is
listed for but there is no price on the
high-rez earphones just yet and like we
said before it will not be bundled with
the US version of the phone and it also
will not be bundled with unlocked
versions of the HTC 10 which is a bit of
a bummer but if you are in the market
for a better set of earphones then you
could go for the HTC made ones that do
boom sound very well so as always thank
you guys very much for watching and I
hope you enjoyed this review of the HTC
x' main accesories don't forget to check
