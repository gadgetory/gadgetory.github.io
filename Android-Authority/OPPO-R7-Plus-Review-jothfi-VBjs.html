Android authority and the Oppo r7 has
already proven to be a great premium
mid-range flagship but what does the
Plus version bring to the table besides
just a larger size well let's find out
what the Oppo r7 plus so as the name
suggests the r7 plus is basically a
blown-up version of the smaller
r7 besides the larger size and slightly
thicker profile the r7 plus is
practically the same phone the body is
completely made of metal that rounds off
around the corners and sides and
chamfered edges go around the entire
front perimeter of the phone in the hand
it feels just as solid as you would
expect from a metal clad phone and being
only 7.8 millimeters thick gives it a
very sleek look and makes it a little
bit easier to handle but don't get me
wrong here it's still a large phone the
smooth metal body also makes the phone a
tad slick and although I haven't dropped
it I don't necessarily always feel
confident using the phone with one hand
Oppo however has done quite a few things
to make one hand use as best as possible
the bezels all around have been kept
nice and tight and the power and volume
keys are conveniently located on the
right and left sides and they're placed
well enough to reduce the amount of
shuffling you would have to do in the
hand if they were situated otherwise
ports like the 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack and microUSB port are on the top
and bottom respectively and on the rear
is the single speaker camera and
fingerprint scanner which we'll get into
later a notification LED light is
upfront next to the front facing camera
and typical proximity and ambient light
sensors but unlike the r7 you won't find
any capacitive keys on the bottom
instead Oppo opted for on-screen keys
for the r7 Plus which again was most
likely a move to help minimise the
phone's footprint the main reason for
the r7 plusses large size is due to the
display it's a six inch AMOLED screen
made of 2.5 D glass for that subtle
curve along the edges and features the
same 1080p resolution as the regular r7
and it practically dominates the entire
front of the phone with an almost
edge-to-edge appearance although it may
fall short by today's standards it's a
good-looking scree
overall it's reasonably sharp at 367 PPI
that you won't really have much of an
issue with reading text or graphics and
the large size makes it a pretty awesome
experience for movies and games since
it's an AMOLED screen you can expect
deep blacks vibrant and punchy colors
good viewing angles and it's fairly easy
to see in direct sunlight at max
brightness but definitely far from the
best the internals of the r7 plus is
identical to the r7 with a Snapdragon
615 and three gigs of RAM the Snapdragon
615 has proven to be a very formidable
chipset and other devices and the story
is pretty much the same here which is
only augmented further by the
optimizations Oppo has made to color OS
for faster boot times and app launching
in general everyday use performance has
been very responsive and snappy and
three gigs of ram is more than plenty
for a smooth multitasking experience
even with the somewhat heavy color OS
skin I haven't noticed any hiccups with
anything I wanted to do including gaming
which has been a very pleasurable
experience and just in case you're
wondering no it does not overheat it
gets warm after long periods of heavy
use but that's very normal behavior for
any smartphone the remaining Hardware on
the r7 plus includes the typical stuff
like Wi-Fi Bluetooth 4.0 GPS and LTE
connectivity but there's no NFC to take
advantage of things like mobile payments
which may or may not be a deal-breaker
depending on how much you use NFC for
storage the Oppo r7 plus comes in a 32
gigabyte configuration and that should
still be fine for most people but if you
need more the r7 plus supports microSD
card expansion for up to a hundred and
twenty eight extra gigs of storage via
the secondary slot on the phone's dual
SIM tray speaker quality on the r7 plus
is nothing extraordinary it sounds fine
and gets the job done
but it's a little too quiet for my taste
and being mounted on the rear isn't the
most optimal position it's pretty easily
muffled when laying on a table or other
flat surfaces and since the audio is
firing away from your ears it doesn't
make for the best audio experience also
located on the rear is the addition of a
fingerprint scanner which is probably
the most notable piece of hardware on
the r7 plus
fingerprint scanners are starting to
become a very popular security measure
in smartphone so it's nice to see a
company like Oppo hopping on board the
fingerprint scanner itself is a small
rectangular pad that you simply just
rest your finger on to unlock the phone
and in my experience it's been just as
fast reliable and accurate as
fingerprint scanners on other devices
like the Galaxy s6 one m9 plus and even
the iPhone setting up the fingerprint
scanner is also a very similar
experience to other phones requiring a
series of repeated presses to properly
capture your fingerprint the process is
quick and painless and takes maybe a
minute or two at most
and additional fingerprints can be added
if you desire but once the setup process
is done you are good to go being mounted
on the back isn't unusual by any means
but it definitely is different from the
more recent implementations that we've
seen the rear placement makes sense as
it's a natural resting point for your
index finger and personally I think it's
much easier to reach for versus a
front-mounted one but it isn't without
its drawbacks
for starters you can't unlock using your
fingerprint at the phone's resting on
its back and secondly using other
fingerprints such as your thumb is
completely possible but isn't
necessarily comfortable those aren't
deal-breakers or anything but just
quirks to be aware of if you're used to
phones with front mounted fingerprint
scanners the battery in the r7 plus is a
very generous 4100 milliamp power
battery and battery life has been
extremely excellent I can easily get
through a full day and the phone always
has enough juice left over to get me
through the better part of a second day
before finally having to reconnect to a
charger whether I'm playing a lot of
games catching up on YouTube or just
using the phone more casually the r7
plus always surpasses the five-hour
screen on time mark and sometimes gets
pretty close to 6 hours
this phone is extremely hard to kill in
a single day and that's a good thing
because that isn't something you can say
about many modern-day smartphones when
you finally do run out of battery or
just need to quickly top off the r7 plus
comes with oboes now tried-and-true boop
rapid charging technology a feature that
has become a staple with oba devices and
it's an awesome feature to take
advantage of on any open device that
supports it but especially so on the r7
plus due to its large battery for the
camera the
our seven-plus features a 13 megapixel
camera with F 2.2 aperture laser
autofocus LED flash and the front camera
is an 8 megapixel shooter that's capable
of taking some surprisingly
great-looking selfies if you're into
that sort of thing and should be more
than good enough for other things like
video chats the camera UI is fairly
simple and switching between capturing
photos and video can be done just by
swiping on the viewfinder tapping on the
icon in the upper right will reveal a
bunch of shooting modes from beautify
Ultra HD slow shutter live filters gifs
to the basic essentials like HDR and
panorama if those aren't enough you can
download extra modes under the more
functions section that includes things
like double exposure super macro and
even one that allows for shooting in RAW
format so you can post process the
images yourself one feature that OPA has
been really touting with this camera is
the use of an RGB W sin Sur which as a
white pixel - the usual RGB setup and
this is supposed to allow for
substantially better low-light
performance Oppo is claiming 32% higher
sensitivities of light and 78% in noise
reduction this is all just a bunch of
marketing mumbo jumbo and all that
really matters is the end result and the
r7 plusses camera definitely delivers in
low-light voters are well exposed
without blowing out the highlights and
there's very little noise and while
photos do lose some sharpness and
low-light there's still a surprisingly
good amount of visible detail when
zooming in the only real issue in
low-light is the shutter speed tends to
get a bit slow making it difficult to
always get a well focused shot in normal
lighting conditions the camera performs
even better there's plenty of detail and
sharpness colors are accurate and true
to life dynamic range is decent and the
camera experience is a lot faster in
these conditions making it a joy to use
HDR works well for the extra boost and
dynamic range but sometimes can be
finicky with exposure and some images
tend to have a much warmer tone
otherwise the r7 plusses camera is a
very solid shooter and is probably one
the best that you'll find in the
mid-range market software wise you're
looking at android 5.1.1 with opus color
OS and this is a pretty major difference
from the regular r7 as a right now which
was launched with kick
aesthetically you won't really notice a
difference anyways as color OS takes
over pretty much anything and everything
that you find in stock lollipop it's a
very similar skin from other Chinese
OEMs with an app drawer list launcher
but it's a very clean experience with
nice-looking icons transparencies and
there's a good amount of color sprinkled
into the elements of the OS but it
doesn't overdo it to the point where it
feels intrusive if you're familiar with
color OS then you'll feel right at home
with many of its features there's a
built-in theme engine that allows for
customization of the OS if you don't
like the default look or just want a
change of scenery it's a very well
fleshed out theme store with plenty to
pick from so you shouldn't have any
problems finding something that you'd
like many of the screen on and screen
off gestures are all still available
like double tapping the screen to wake
the display drawing an O on the screen
to launch directly into the camera or
you can create your own gestures as you
see fit the screen on gestures include
things like being able to take a
screenshot with a three-finger swipe
adjusting the volume with two fingers
swiping in from one of the two bottom
corners to shrink the screen for easier
one-handed use and double tapping the
HOME key to put the phone to sleep as
gimmicky as some of these features might
sound I did find quite a few of them
useful and mix mundane tasks like taking
a screenshot or launching the camera
quicker and easier to do the r7 plus is
expected to launch with a sub $500 price
tag of around 480 dollars some may find
it to be a little bit high in this day
and age for a mid-range phone especially
when compared to a lot of e sub $300
mid-range flagships out there but you
have to keep in mind these sacrifices
OEMs had to make the hit those price
points ople make very few sacrifices
with the r7 Plus which makes the price
more justifiable it's far from being a
steal of a price like the oneplus 2 or
even the upcoming Moto X but you
certainly aren't going to feel ripped
off should you decide to go with one if
you're looking for a smartphone with an
all-metal build a massive screen and
almost two day battery life the r7 plus
will be an investment that you won't
regret as always guys thank you so much
