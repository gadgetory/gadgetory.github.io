a big deal for a lot of different
reasons and one of them is because of
that big old G on the back it's Josh of
regard from Android Authority what's
going on everybody and this is a
hands-on and first look at the Google
pixel and pixel XF now for the purposes
of this hands-on the google pixel will
be the white phone that I'm using and
the Google pixel XL will be the black
version that I'm using there is a blue
version of the phone but we did not get
any time with that device there are a
couple of photos you can see of it over
at andrew authority comm and for the
sake of argument the google pixel XL
does have a larger 5.5 inch screen at
quad HD resolution over the full HD
screen of the Google pixel and of course
it has a larger battery now you may have
seen the Google assistant already on
Google a low if you happen to be using
that messaging service but now Google
assistant is essentially what replaces
Google now on tap in the Android
iteration of new get that is found in
the pixel phones these will be the first
place and currently one of the only
places that you can use Google assistant
as the overarching software in these
phones that said the software looks
essentially what we expected it to with
the launcher being the pixel launcher
you can slide to the left in order to go
to a Google now page and there's a
Google button on top that is always on
the ready if you want to do a search but
of course you still have the usage of
the hot word
okay Google in order to turn on the
phone and essentially turn on Google
assistant you can also hold the home
button and it will open up Google
assistance the thing about Google
assistant is that it's actually kind of
scary accurate it's really good at
picking up the voice and in the very
loud area that I was in the phone was
able to pick up my voice and accurately
convert my speech to text with no
problems at all and the search is
actually really robust you're seeing in
this clip right now that I'm saying a
lot of different search terms and Google
is able to take the text that it
converts from my speech and do the
search properly in a lot of cases
actually opening the appropriate
application that I wanted for example
saying that I wanted to play a specific
very specific thing like TJ Perkins
entrance meant that it opened up
tube and showed me lo and behold the
actual video of that entrance this
version of Android nougat is only found
on the pixel and it is powered by a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 one that is the
latest Snapdragon that is available and
the most powerful currently and it's
backed by four gigabytes of RAM and for
the pixel you have the 27 70 milliamp
hour battery while the pixel XL has a
much larger 3450 milliamp hour battery
that can be quick charged or rather fast
charged for up to seven hours of battery
life in only 15 minutes also if you are
a little bit worried when the slide came
up showing the USBC port on the bottom
rest assured there is a headphone jack
on here it was a bit of a sidestep that
they did everyone gasped in the audience
when they saw that portion but the
headphone jack is on the top of the
phone obviously we're going to put
Google assistant through its paces once
we get our review units and the same
will be said for the Android iteration
that's found in these phones
it seems pretty snappy so far and it's
actually quite clean and if these pixel
phones are supposed to go up against the
standalone ecosystem of iOS for example
well then this is going to be one way of
consolidating what is supposed to be
what Android is all about with that all
said the phone's themselves are kind of
bare-bones which I actually personally
liked I prefer to have bare bone looking
phones that then have a lot of
capabilities underneath that surface
that glass panel on the bag that
combines with the metal unibody is a
kind of unique look but overall it's
basically just a shiny slab that is
available where the fingerprint reader
is and then of course there's the camera
up top because of that chamfer on the
sides I got to the point where I thought
this phone looked like an iPhone mash
together with a moto Z force and finally
we will talk about the camera a little
bit of course we don't have any samples
to show you but we did play around with
a few of the settings on there the
camera application looks a lot like what
you would expect from a Nexus phone it's
pretty simple and you can swipe in and
out in order to go to different modes
now there is video stabilization on here
but there's no oh is on these cameras
it's all EIS which is software based
stabilization and so that might sway a
few people but apparently video
stabilization supposed to be very good
we will do with that testing
to get our review units on paper it
might seem like these cameras are
exactly the same as the ones we got in
the Nexus line from last year twelve
point three megapixels at one point five
five micron sizes which make for better
low-light shots and F 2.0 aperture but
there should be some optimizations in
here and Google was very keen on telling
us that the XO mark gave this camera one
of its highest if not the highest rating
of a smartphone ever it does help though
that Google photos is a big part of the
pixel phones where you will be able to
use unlimited storage at full resolution
for both videos and photos so when it
comes to the lack of an SD card slot you
probably won't have any problems keeping
space on your phone because everything
will be uploaded to the cloud anyway
with a price tag on the pixel of 649
dollars we will have to think a little
harder on whether or not these phones
are actually that exciting enough to
warrant such a high price point with an
even higher price point therefore 128
gigabyte models or even just a pixel
excel at 32 gigabytes but with that said
there's a lot to be excited about not
just with the pixel phones but with the
rest of the ecosystem that Google is
hoping to create based upon what is
actually a pretty mind-blowing thing in
Google assistant but of course we will
give you our final thoughts on this once
we get our hands on review units and our
full review comes out here at Android
authority so keep it tuned to Android or
'ti for more about the Google pixel
phones and you can also see a couple of
quick look comparisons with a couple of
the bigger phones including the note 7
and the Nexus 6p both of which will be
compared to the Google pixel XL from
there you can stick around for our full
reviews and even more from the Google
pixel phones because we are your source
for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
