brought to you by atlassian build what's
next in today's show we try and tackle
the question is modular design the way
forward is it the next best thing will
the start off let's first talk about why
it might not be the next best thing the
next big concern is compatibility right
now the LG g5 is the only device in the
world that works with LG friends it's
unclear how teens third-party
manufacturers will be to jump on board
with the modular design train before the
LG g5 has proven itself as a desirable
device they will need to see that
there's actually a market for more
modules beyond what LG has already made
and what happens with the LG G 6 next
year will the existing g 5 modules fit
or will LG refine the idea and have a
new system in place updating the module
mechanism would upset a lot of early
adopters for obvious reasons but if LG
maintains compatibility and it really
should then the LG G 6 will be the same
width as the g5 and there'll be no
changes to the headphone port or speaker
placements in next year's flagship well
that's perfectly fine it does certainly
lock LG into a corner there's really a
long list of challenges that LG has to
come over creating an ecosystem of
third-party manufacturers to create new
modules that get people excited over
time will it be cost-prohibitive is this
going to be more expensive than your
average flagship and is it just a geeks
dream is your grandma or your Aunt May
gonna buy a new camera module a year
after she buys her phone I don't know I
think the number one concern is that the
rate of technological change is just too
fast to have or care about a modular
design five to ten years from now here's
what I think think about it LG must have
spent two to three years researching and
designing this new modular design and
it's a great play for them it gets them
a lot of press and it's a geeks dream
and geeks become evangelists to the
average users so it's a good play for LG
in their place in the market but think
about it ten years from now are we going
to be consuming the internet
media through these tiny little windows
these rectangular block devices I don't
think so I think a combination of
virtual reality and new wearables are
going to open things up and we're not
looking at the whole wild world of the
internet through these tiny little
windows and no one's talking about
excessive wear and tear when I built my
pc downstairs for gaming that I still
use now like eight nine years ago that
thing has lasted forever because I'm
able to upgrade the component parts this
is why everyone's so excited about
modular design but that pc stays on my
desktop i can upgrade the video card and
ram and it never moves so i'm not really
having wear or tear issues but on a
mobile device is going on my pocket my
bag my glove compartments being thrown
around all the time all those movable
parts increase the wear and tear
tendency I am not so sure that we are
going to have a phone that's modular
design that's gonna last three to four
years with all those movable parts what
do you guys think let me know in the
comments below but then again I could be
wrong here's why it might work the LG g5
could truly be revolutionary it not only
looks different it's radically different
from anything that's come before it and
potentially opens up a whole new world
of accessories and peripherals without
requiring an expensive upgrade LG
friends takes the smartphone and gives
so much potential for many enthusiasts
from photographers to audio files
unleash your team's potential with
atlassian collaboration software so you
can work and communicate better together
a sign track and manage tasks for any
project no matter how complex that's the
clarity of JIRA creating share content
organized results and bring team members
up to speed that's the flexibility of
confluence now what I like about
atlassian the most is that it doesn't
constrict me to communicating with my
team in one way if I don't want to chat
it out in the chat box I can go to video
chat and that is a good thing that's
atlassian calm unleash the potential of
your team build what's next
