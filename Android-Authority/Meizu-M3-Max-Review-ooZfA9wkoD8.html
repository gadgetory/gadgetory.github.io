with Android authority you're watching
our video review of the meizu and three
max basil isn't packing any big
surprises with the m3 Max's design but
that may not be such a bad thing the UH
three max offers the same top-notch
build quality that we've seen from a zoo
in the past and it's all-metal
construction provides an unmistakeably
tank-like feel this design is admittedly
uninspired but it hasn't very ly
signifies a level of premiumness that is
been steadily creeping into this price
category design elements like the
Shatford edges and subtle antenna lines
are definitely a nice touch especially
for what you're paying it's not a
perfect design by any means though its
side to back Shaffers aren't enough to
disguise a pretty boxy feel it can be
difficult to find the correct side
button is there aren't any tactile
differences one factor that you'll
really want to consider is the sheer
size of the m3 max its 6-inch display
can be both a blessing and a curse the
larger size is great for watching videos
and playing games but it can also be
annoying to use with a single hand it's
an inevitable trade-off and one that we
advise you to consider very carefully
for navigation Mesa does it a bit
differently than other OEMs instead of a
standard three key layout there's a
single physical button which can be
tapped to go back or press to go home
although the style does take a day or
two to get used to it's remarkably
intuitive to use the button also
functions as a fast and accurate in your
print reader which is an incredibly
indispensable feature to have now you
may be wondering but what do I do for
multitasking the answer to that question
is actually quite simple you just swipe
up from the bezel on either side of the
home button as you can see the
multi-tasking menu scales up as you
swipe revealing any open app the m3 max
is six inch 1080p IPS display isn't
overly impressive but does the job it's
bright enough for indoor use offers
fairly accurate color reproduction
there's a great size for consuming media
although sunlight readability and
viewing angles aren't very
good it's important to keep in mind the
phone's price it would be a bit
unreasonable to expect something like a
quad HD AMOLED panel for example the m3
Maxx is utilizing three gigabytes of RAM
and a mediatek helio p10 which quite
frankly offers poor performance it may
be active core but it's one of mediatek
slowest and chips offering performance
similar to what could be found in 2012
it's not just the benchmark scores that
are bad with this one though in real
world view the phone legs quite
frequently and it's just generally
sluggish for example in our testing the
m3 max would randomly refuse to wait
from sleep for around 10 to 30 seconds
well we can forgive a little bit of this
the m3 max exceeds what we would
consider acceptable gaming performance
is also below average as the Mali t8 60
GPU is outdated and simply does not
offer the same performance is comparable
adrenal options
the m3 max is an unlocked dual SIM
device and supports 4G LTE in official
markets if you're looking to import it
however you may have trouble getting it
to work with your carrier and the United
States for example it's not compatible
with 4G LTE it is only partially
compatible with 3G on AT&amp;amp;T mobile you
can substitute one SIM card for a
microSD card though up to 128 gigabytes
if the phone's 64 gigabytes of internal
storage isn't enough of course we always
like to see that option available we did
notice some minor Wi-Fi range issues
during our time with the m3 max and
although this may sound somewhat
nitpicky if you already have range
issues and your household this could be
a major issue for audio we're looking at
a single side firing speaker it's decent
sounding loud enough in most cases but
slightly distorted moreso at higher
volumes it again does the job but if you
want to consume media without headphones
it may not be the best option out there
battery life was great though as the
4,100 milliamp hour battery is enough to
push through a full day of moderate to
heavy use our testing was conducted well
connected to hemt 3G network so our
numbers are expected ly inflated but you
should have no trouble reaching around
the four-and-a-half hour mark over LTE
for fast charging the meizu m3
max says 45% in 30 minutes with mazes
proprietary and charge technology we
wish extra and car chargers were more
accessible and that Mesa would have used
USBC instead of the old microUSB
standard the 13 megapixel Sony IMX
2 5 8 camera provides average results
for this price category images looks
decent but far from great and bright
lighting color reproduction is generally
good with respectable dynamic range many
images feel punchy enough without being
oversaturated too however images appear
grainy even with good lighting the
post-processing struggles with bright
colors whilst notably pink and red
images are also generally soft and
autofocus can be surprisingly hit or
miss tapping the screen doesn't always
work for obtaining a correct focus which
of course affected some of our shots
other shots just appear soft in general
it's also not the quickest camera we've
used and although this is fine for still
object it's troubling when trying to
capture images of moving objects
low-light unfortunately makes things
much worse the Green has turned out to
very distracting levels and colors
appear more muted than in better lit
conditions autofocus struggles even more
- resulting in some awfully soft images
video recording is capped off at 1080p
which shouldn't be a big deal for a lot
of people but if 4k recording is
important to you you know that there are
similarly priced options that allow you
to record better higher resolution video
mazes slimy OS makes a return with the
m3 max on top of Android 6.0 marshmallow
we're not expecting this phone to be
upgraded to nougat but we can partially
forgive that since mazes frequently
updates their slimy skin with new
features and refinements often times for
up to two years after a phone release
the actual experience may appear jarring
to an outsider its iOS inspired design
and lack of an app drawer are admittedly
uncommon in Western skins but slimy
remains one of the best Android skins
we've used it's different but that
doesn't make it bad the amount of polish
is admirable and we have to credit meizu
for their dedication to improving
climbing over the past several
years still it can be annoyingly quirky
for Western users issues like hangouts
occasionally just refusing to open until
a reinstall is performed are
unfortunately fairly common the battery
optimizations also aren't tailored to
Western apps for example by default the
phone closes Spotify after 30 seconds of
the phone screen being off effectively
stopping any music this can be manually
fixed by turning off optimizations for
Spotify but it shouldn't have to be in
China the Mazal m3 max can be purchased
in black silver and gold for 1700 UN or
about two hundred forty five dollars
pressing berries and other markets and
if you're looking to import expected to
cost around $270 although the m3 max
does well in some categories like
software battery life and build quality
it doesn't offer any advantages over
cheaper similarly-sized options instead
of the meizu m3 max we recommend the
$220 Shamim Emacs if you're in an
official market for is better
performance superior camera and similar
software otherwise you should consider
the 100 to $150 ZTE grand X max to where
it's also better performance greater
availability and nicer display these
phones also aren't perfect for me Max's
build quality is poor and the grand X
max tooth camera is just very bad but we
feel that they are better options
