handy the Android authority app guy
everybody knows minecraft in the
continuous march of similar games that
try to achieve similar success rarely
are they any good but a new game called
gun crafter seems to have some potential
in this video we're gonna take a closer
look at it let's start with gameplay
this is a very simple game with very
simple controls virtually everything in
the game is controlled by a tilt or a
tap of the screen this is especially
helpful for people who can't stand
complicated on-screen controls here's
how the game works it opens up to a menu
where you can build battle view awards
and share to social networks the awards
and share buttons don't do much unless
you'd like to view awards or you know
share things the fun actually starts in
build mode from this menu you can build
up to about a dozen guns with various
materials you start with a small square
eight bullets per clip and wood as
materials as you level up you get better
materials more bullets and larger
squares to build more awesome weapons
battle note is not what you think it is
if you thought you were going to run
around and shoot little Minecraft
looking dudes you were wrong in battle
mode you engage in shooting range style
contests to see who can shoot the most
blocks the fastest the last thing we
want to mention are the extra modes
these include farming and chance and
farming you plant flowers you later
shoot for money you earn plants enchants
mode and you can wait as long as you
want to shoot them chance is simply a
game of chance for you shoot at spinning
blocks to win prizes you can win coins
plants are absolutely nothing at all all
in all everything worked as it should
and we had no complaints about the
gameplay next up we'll talk about
graphics it's a game based on the same
groundbreaking graphics that fuelled the
classic Minecraft as such everything is
a block everything the bullets the guns
the stuff you shoot at it's all blocks
if you're not into blocks you will hate
this game don't let the graphics fool
you though as minecraft once proved you
can have a perfectly fun and popular
game even with graphics that would have
been groundbreaking in 1985 this game is
fun for its mechanics and not for its
looks so don't expect too much out of
its looks the game music was passable by
that we mean it had music but it wasn't
particularly good music it served its
purpose which is about all you can ask
for out of game music gunshots sounded
like gunshots and there were additional
sound effects for clicks coins and
hitting blocks so here's what we liked
the game at its core is pretty fun we
found it
to lose oneself for a sizable amount of
time tinkering with builds to get the
best stats and coin farming to unlock
more guns the build your own gun concept
altogether is actually really cool
another thing we liked was the quick
gameplay there aren't 15 minute battles
where you have to be in the zone to play
the game well rounds take a minute or
two and you can choose to face bots and
practice or real people in multiplayer
matchmaking
lastly we like their matchmaking system
it's quite fast as advertised and
finding an opponent never took very long
thankfully there are enough players at
all skill levels so you are always
matched up with someone packing around
the same hardware that you are so here's
what we didn't like while the build mode
is awesome it has its limitations the
stats for your custom gun get better
when you keep to the typical aesthetic
of a gun we thought this was kind of
lame that many off-the-wall designs were
penalized with bad stats we've felt this
stifled creativity a little bit also the
farming and chance minigames felt a
little incomplete there are only three
options for chance games and farming is
really just placing plans and then
shooting them later we felt there could
have been more there thankfully it
doesn't take away from the main
attraction of gun crafter lastly we
would have liked to have seen more
content there are six materials and five
gun sizes so there are plenty of ways to
build the gun however once everything
has been unlocked there is nothing left
to do but duel it would have been nice
to see more content added and hopefully
more things get added in the future at
the end of the day this is a cheap game
that can take weeks or months to finish
depending on how much you play aside
from being cheap it's also quite fun
despite the lack of long-term content
the game's content focuses around
creating your own gun and then shooting
things with it everything else is pretty
much inconsequential with that said
don't underestimate just how much fun it
can be to build a gun and shoot things
with it it's very fast to get into and
easy to get your first few upgrades you
don't run into the classic coin an
upgrade grind until you're much higher
leveled so it's definitely friendlier
for new gamers so would we recommend it
sure we would at most it's a buck
although you can get it for free as well
you can spend more if you wish to unlock
things sooner but it is possible to go
through the whole game without a single
in-app purchase and we really like that
