authority coming at you from Beijing
China and I'm here for the late eco
event you might be more familiar with
this company by the former name of late
Evy and if you followed our CES coverage
back in January you may remember that we
covered one of their flagship devices
the Eco inlay eco stands for eco system
and that's exactly what they're trying
to build here with the latest line of
products they did announced several new
Android smartphones which we'll get into
in a second but they also announced a
bunch of other cool stuff as well like a
new TV a new VR headset and even a
freaking autonomous driving car with
this being an eco system all these new
products are vertically integrated with
one another through late EKOS eco system
UI basically what this means is you'll
get access to all their services like
the cloud sports movies or original
content across all devices and even do
things like nine simultaneous streams on
a single device or call upon your car
just by speaking to your smartphone now
one thing to keep in mind is a lot of
these services are for China so if and
when late eco decides to bring this to
the US they're most likely will be a lot
of changes that would have to take place
in order to make it all work
as far as the phone's go they announced
three new smart phones there was a lei
to delay to pro and they'll a max to the
names are a little confusing but
basically all you need to know is the
lady is the most standard or basic model
the two pro is practically the same
phone as the two on the outside but it's
got slightly better specs like a higher
resolution camera faster processor and
more RAM that you have the granddaddy of
them all with delay max 2 and if you
want the latest and greatest specs this
is the one you're going to want to get
even though the late 2 is the standard
model out of the bunch and still pack
some pretty nice specs it's got a 5.5
inch 1080p IPS LCD display the mediatek
helio X 20 processor 3 gigs of RAM a 16
megapixel camera on the rear an 8
megapixel camera on the front for
selfies a 3000 milliamp hour battery a
built-in fingerprint sensor and it's all
wrapped up in a very sleek and premium
feeling metal body if you want to step
things up a notch the late two pro will
give you the same form fact
and design but with a higher resolution
21 megapixel camera four gigs of ram and
a slightly faster processor with the
Helio X 25 the lame x2 it's pretty much
going to be the phone that gives other
flagships a run for their money
and it's the only one that's confirmed
for a US launch so far although we still
don't know exactly when it's packing a
slightly larger 5.7 inch display and
it's also higher resolution at quad HD
instead of 1080p like on delay to the
rear camera is 21 megapixels with an 8
megapixel camera on the front a 3000
milliamp hour battery and it also has
the same fingerprint sensor as the other
two devices inside it's got a much more
powerful processor with the Snapdragon
820 which puts it on par with bones like
the s7 and g5 but lay eco unveil that
there will be a 64 gig version of this
phone that is going to come with a
whopping six gigs of RAM which is pretty
insane they're all Android 6.0
marshmallow powered smartphones but like
I mentioned earlier these phones are
utilizing late EKOS ecosystem UI which
brings a pretty different experience
from your typical Android smartphone but
the ecosystem UI is also what allows all
these devices to seamlessly integrate
with one another and fully take
advantage of late eco services one thing
you may or may not have noticed with
these devices by now is that none of
them feature a headphone jack
oh god no God please no no no no don't
freak out though you can still get audio
through the USB type-c port with your
favorite headphones but you have to use
the adapter which does come included
with the phone itself but what do you
guys think about these new smartphones
or other products that Leigh Eco
announced like to be our headset or the
autonomous car let us know down in the
comments below and if you want to know

pricing and availability and all that
