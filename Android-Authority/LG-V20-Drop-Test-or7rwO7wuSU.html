have a brand new smartphone in my pocket
this seems oddly familiar hey Joshua car
from Android thority what's going
everybody and in my hands is the brand
new LG V 20 newly announced and
available soon the whole idea behind the
V 20 as it has a different design from
the v10 is that it is made from metal
that is recycled from airplanes so this
is Mellott military level protection on
here and if we take this back cover off
it actually feels incredibly durable
this is a very solid backing and well
we're going to put it to the test
in our traditional drop test before we
drop it on its back and then onto one of
its sides
typically the bottom here and then of
course the last one where we might
actually see some problems dropping it
on its face back test coming up in three
two one
well one of the things that always
happened with removable backings on
smartphones back in the day or even dumb
phones back in the day is that they all
broke apart when they would fall on the
ground with enough force that's exactly
what we saw here with the LG v 20 go
ahead and just pick up the unit itself
aren't any problems with the screen not
really any scuffs around and then the
battery did pop out so of course that
was a problem I'm going to go ahead and
put that battery back in right now and
then I'll show you a closer look on this
camera up here so the good news is that
the phone is completely intact there
weren't any scuffs or anything that
really damaged the device we do have a
little bit of blemish right here but it
really isn't a whole lot so let's say
get a little bit too antsy about going
around the device there's nothing wrong
with it and if I were to turn the device
back on again we have the LG logo coming
up it's still a fully functioning device
even if it did break apart pretty
completely due to that removable back
it's nice that it actually breaks apart
like that because it actually absorbs a
lot of the shock so we're probably not
going to have too many problems if it
falls on its back side test dropping in
three two and one two and one I guess
that really wasn't much of a surprise
was it taking the phone out we do have a
scuff on the bottom where it landed
obviously the battery popped out once
again no damage to the battery so it's
not going to explode in my hand
thankfully so we see one little scratch
here in the corner
nothing really all that severe so it
still looks pretty good but I actually
wanted to keep the cover off for a
second to show you that there are a
couple of scuffs on the battery I'm
still not all that concerned that it's
going to blow up or a catch fire or
anything like that but I did want to
show you that there were these little
marks on the battery because it is being
tumbled around now while the phone boots
up I will tell you we had a unique
opportunity to even test out this phone
here in Berlin Germany
we're obviously standing in front of the
Bundestag so it's awesome that we were
able to take the v20 out when we have
the time to and be able to test it to
see if it is actually as durable as it
needs to be three two one and drop and
drop
well the back popped off but thankfully
the battery stayed in so hopefully I'll
have that shot for you but the moment of
truth is always the screen in this one
so let's see what happened looks like
it's fine
darn any scratches or not even any
cracks on the screen so so far it's
doing a really great job let's take a
closer look up here it's great that the
battery did not come off of the device
because now I still have the same camera
shot recording and yeah it looks like
the screen was able to survive it it was
a really flat drop onto this rock over
here and really I wasn't really
expecting the screen to crack hopefully
the military-grade durability was going
to hold up here even on the screen and
the conditions made it so that it was
able to survive that kind of drop but
we're gonna take it up a notch
after all we really want to see just how
far this can go and maybe in the future
we'll do even more extreme testing on
this but for now we're going to just up
the ante by upping the distance we do
have our colleague Chris Carlin here who
is much taller than me so we're gonna
have him come in and do the test even
higher than chest level for him he's
gonna hold it
nice and high up I'm gonna see how it
fares in the same test from a higher
distance up Chris yep I'm gonna count
you down ok 3 2 1 2 1 well a higher
distance means that there's gonna be
more spread so let's see what happened
starting with the back cover which
obviously flew off it still looks really
good it's not getting scuffed a whole
lot on the bottom here the battery even
though I noticed that there are some
marks that are here still looks pretty
intact I don't think this is going to
combust on me and then on the bottom
portion or rather the main portion of
the phone everything looks pretty good
all right well here's the phone power
bond works well LG logo everything is
still powering up just fine so higher
distance up still doing pretty well
dropping in three two one one
these explosions are becoming very
commonplace for us so the bottom portion
is what we dropped it on obviously and a
higher distance up could take a look at
the bottom and it is getting more
scuffed but still nothing to really get
all that worried about there's one
really good scuff right here though but
that just means that all the shock made
the phone explode out that's the wrong
term to use it made it break apart I'm
mainly worried about the battery because
it keeps having to brave the elements
and scoot around but it looks good still
and we'll go ahead and pop that back in
and finally the back cover still feels
really good works perfectly fine but now
the final test one more drop onto its
face from about this high
is that really your height I can go VIN
oilin okay you can go a bit higher than
that final test on its face dropping in
three two one
perfect it's funny how we can actually
predict what's going to happen the
battery stayed in again thank God back
cover came off it's hopefully still
recording I'm gonna wave my hand over it
but here comes the moment of truth no
poor v20 alright I'm gonna go up to this
angle up here so we can get a closer
look at the destruction I'm putting the
cover back on but really this this phone
is done and there it is all of the
cracks the spiderwebs the whatever you
want to call them I'm actually scared to
press on to the screen right now to turn
off the video recording because I'm
afraid I'll cut my finger that has
happened to me before but you can see
all of those scratches oh dear well of
course from a good enough impact and a
good enough distance the screen will
shatter and that's exactly what we were
able to do in this drop test here well
unfortunately we were able to crack the
screen of the V 20 but the rest of the
body it did a really good job well I'm
not sure if in this video here which
you're probably seeing right now there's
a crack going straight across the front
facing camera so maybe you can see some
discoloration or maybe just a little bit
of difference here because I'm obviously
staring at a completely shattered screen
this phone may be still be usable but
with all those scratches and spiderweb
cracks right there you're probably going
to cut your finger it's better to just
replace that glass panel but the rest of
the phone did wonderfully well there are
no scuffs except for the one that's on
the bottom here when we dropped it from
that high distance but from there it's
still a good looking phone it's just as
inoperable when it comes to the
touchscreen well that's our test at
least this particular durability test
for the LG v 20 we have a lot of
coverage of the lv 20 here at android
Ithorian you can make sure to check that
all out at Android comm and beyond in
our youtube channel as well we have
comparisons or hands on and we're going
to have your full review available soon
