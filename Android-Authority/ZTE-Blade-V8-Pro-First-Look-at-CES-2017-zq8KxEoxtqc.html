and here we're taking a look at the ZTE
blade v8 pro now the blade v8 has a 5.5
inch screen has full HD resolution and
is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625
now that should provide some pretty good
performance for the mid-tier users and
it could be a reliable phone to use
especially at a lower price point as
this is exactly what we're looking at
here the rear camera however is where a
lot of the fun is at you get to 13
megapixel cameras and one of them helps
get depth information so you can have an
aperture type mode essentially you'll be
able to take a photo of your subject
hopefully just a little bit in front of
the camera and it will be able to put
that in focus based upon a particular
aperture and have everything else bokade
out or just slightly blurred out for a
nice filmic look from there you can
actually go into the gallery and change
where the focus is either in the
foreground or the background and change
exactly what might be fully in focus in
what is bokade out other specifications
include a 30 140 milliamp hour battery
which is pretty good considering that
this phone is at 5.5 inches but sports
1080p resolution so battery life could
be quite good on here after that it
feels pretty nice in the hand and it has
a nice backing that is a textured rubber
that kind of provides it more grip than
some of the other phones I have seen so
far at CES 2017 where it's mostly metal
and glass I kind of slip about so it's a
pretty solid phone inside and out and
you'll be able to get it for a pretty
low price some premium features on this
phone include the fingerprint reader and
there is also a micro SD card slot that
is available on top of the 32 gigabytes
built-in so you do get a few premium
features in a mid tier phone and ZTE was
very adamant about telling us that well
this is sort of one of those phones that
you would get for somebody that needs to
save some money but wants to have some
of the best that's out there in the
smartphone world we certainly agree with
especially the camera package we were
pretty impressed with the first shots
that we got but obviously we're going to
wait into our full review those dual 13
megapixel cameras on the back could
actually make this camera package really
great and probably put it above some of
the other competitors in its price point
and of course a front-facing 8 megapixel
cameras available also if you need to
take your selfies
as always we're going to have to take a
closer look at this one once we get our
hands on a review unit and that should
be happening pretty soon so stick around
to Android Authority for the full review
of the ZTE Blade v8 pro and for even
more from CES 2017 because we are of
course your source for all things
