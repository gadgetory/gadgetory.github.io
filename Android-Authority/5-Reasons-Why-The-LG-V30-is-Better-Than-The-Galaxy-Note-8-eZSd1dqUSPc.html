Note 8 are two phones that are going to
be pretty heavily compared throughout
the remainder of 2017 if you're
considering buying an LG b 30 you're
most likely also considering a Galaxy
Note 8 and vice versa and both these
phones have their pros and their cons
there's certain things that the LG v 30
does better and there's certain things
that the Galaxy Note 8 does better but
in this video we're gonna be focusing on
the LG v 30 and why you should consider
it over the Galaxy Note 8 so here are
five reasons why the LG b 30 is better
than the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 so as a
quick disclaimer this is not a video
bashing the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 the no
8 is an awesome smartphone and we could
totally make the opposite video 5
reasons why the note 8 is better than
the LG B 30 and if you guys want to see
that video let us know down in the
comment section below and also let us
know by hitting that thumbs up button as
well but let's go ahead and dive right
into number one and that is the hi-fi
DAC and mqa support so with the hi-fi
deck in the LG b 30 this is going to
allow you to get much higher quality
audio with less noise less distortion
and much better dynamic range and you
don't need the highest quality pair of
earbuds or headphones to be able to hear
the difference but the built-in DAC will
allow you to be able to drive much
higher impedance headphones to let you
fully take advantage of that sound now
new to the LG b 30 are some
customization options built in for the
back so you have the ability to set some
sound presets and also some digital
filters that allow for a more ambient
natural or clearer sound so you can
really tune the audio specifically for
your ears to how you want it to sound
and they make it really simple and easy
to do but you still have all the other
features as well like the 75 stage
volume control and left and right
channel controls also new to the V 30 is
the support for M QA M QA stands for
master quality authenticated and this
basically allows you to listen to high
res audio without the huge file sizes
that typically come along with them so
the file sizes are a lot smaller and
because they're a lot smaller you can
actually stream
high res audio without killing your
bandwidth right now the only streaming
service that supports mqa is title but
hopefully this will come to other major
streaming services like Spotify and
google play music in the future reason
number two is the fingerprint sensor and
this may sound like a weird one because
they both have fingerprint sensors but
the LGB thirty simply just does it
better it's centered along the back so
it's a lot easier to reach and it also
doubles as a power button which is
something LG has been doing for quite
some time now and I actually like that a
lot on the note 8 it's a lot higher up
and it sits next to the camera so it's
in a very awkward location and you can
get used to it with a little bit of
muscle memory and to be fair Samsung did
make some minor adjustments to make this
one a little bit better and easier to
use than the one that was on the SI it's
slightly more recessed now so it's easy
to find by feel and they've also created
more separation between the camera
lenses and the fingerprint sensor by
putting the heartrate monitor and the
camera flash in between so smudging the
camera lenses is a lot harder to do but
if we're being perfectly honest here
this is really just a temporary fix
until Samsung can figure out what they
really want to do with the fingerprint
sensor which is embedded in the screen
or something along those lines next up
is the video recording capabilities and
no one is doing it better than LG right
now and they've added some really
exciting features to the LG v 30 the
most notable one is the ability to shoot
in logged if you've ever used a disel R
or a mirrorless camera you might be
familiar with log on Sony it's called s
log V log on Panasonic and C log on
Canon so on and so forth and log is a
format that allows you to shoot a
completely flat image that you can
manipulate a lot heavier in post in
terms of color grading and colored
correcting log also gives you much
better dynamic range so you have a lot
more detail in the shadows and the
highlights now if you don't want to mess
around with log you have a new feature
called send a video which allows you to
apply color grading presets directly in
camera so if there's a specific look
that you want but you don't want to
fumble around with post-production and
Final Cut or Adobe Premiere you can do
this instead of
there's a bunch of different color
grading presets and it makes it really
simple and easy to do
sticking to the topic of cameras reason
number four is the wide-angle lens
now both the LGB 30 and ino 8 have dual
cameras but the V 30 has the wide-angle
whereas the no 8 uses a telephoto lens
that gives you 2 X optical zoom and both
of these types of lenses have their own
use cases but if I had to pick between
wide angle or telephoto I would go with
wide angle every time somebody because I
think there's a lot more use cases with
wide-angle there's a lot more situations
where wide-angle comes in handy and if
you're a big traveler like a lot of us
here and rathore TR where we go do a lot
of tradeshows and a lot of events having
a wide-angle lens is extremely useful
especially when you want to take
landscapes or architecture the pictures
are a lot more breathtaking and a lot
more epic looking so wide-angle I think
it's a lot more awesome and if you want
to take a group photo
you don't need a selfie stick in order
to do it another really cool thing about
wide-angle is that you don't have to
take any steps backwards to fit the
subject into the frame and in some
situations you don't really have that
much room to step backwards so that
wide-angle really helps out a lot and
there's a certain level of fun to be had
with a wide-angle lens that you simply
just don't get from a telephoto or even
a monochrome lens the fifth and final
reason why the LGB 30 is better than the
Galaxy Note 8 is it's cheaper okay so we
don't actually know the official price
of the V 30 just yet it has not been
confirmed but rumor has it that it's
going for around 800 thousand KRW in
South Korea which converts to six
hundred ninety nine dollars u.s. and the
LG twitter sweepstakes also showed a
price of seven hundred and fifty dollars
so it's going to be around two hundred
dollars cheaper than the Galaxy Note 8
if these prices are indeed true and two
hundred dollars is a pretty significant
amount of money that would sway a lot of
people's buying decision and unless you
really really need the s-pen
and you get a ton of utility from it
you're better off just saving your money
your wallet will thank you and your bank
account will also thank you so that
wraps up our five reasons why the LGB 30
is better than the Galaxy Note 8 what do
you guys think of this list and are
there any other features of the B 30
that you think makes it better than the
Galaxy Note 8 let us know down in the
comments section below and if you want
to see a 5 reasons why the note 8 is
better than the V 30 let us know that in

our best to make that happen as always
