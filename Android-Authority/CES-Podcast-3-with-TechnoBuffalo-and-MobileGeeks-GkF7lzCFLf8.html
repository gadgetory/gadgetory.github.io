Zune we're not quite there yet in our
friendship okay Canadian living in time
having a timeline that's true so what
was the coolest thing you've seen so far
I realizes it's stupid loaded question
well Allison he also doesn't realize
you're the host of the podcast ok we can
dish it we can share the bridge this is
amazing that was amazing I am totally
done for this super self out but I
haven't even haven't even introduced him
you Wow our listeners and our viewers
know Nicole so well she was on d she was
on the rakesh show we had two days ago
that was one hell of a show where we
hadn't guessed from everything near Rob
with lit up lit little lips like a bulb
but what we have yeah on my left your
right is the great okay I'm gonna let
you introduce yourself okay hi yeah hi
my name is my purse seiner uh did I do
it right yesterday okay cool yeah my cuz
i have it this whole time you know what
this aperture this is actually the only
badge that I've acquired this week that
it has my name spelled correctly okay
last night my name is it Bruce Steiner
which we actually put off made sense
because you brew beer and then you drink
it out of the stein do edge
yeah good asking a question yeah that's
me mention it Oh cooperating is to be
damned oh yeah I think I've been
pronouncing your name wrong this whole
time okay I think the way i pronounced
that i thought was epic yeah yeah all
right you had to have gotten this
pronunciation hit me you know which one
Boop Steiner no buts mark mark burst
dinner oh yeah yeah bristan is good yeah
all day every day my entire life
basically so it's not the best one the
story goes that the short version of the
story is there was a snafu coming to
Ellis Island it's somewhere in my in my
family history okay it was either either
matter they made it more accessible for
America armor cuz they're originally you
know they're like a Stein is really
Jewish and that wasn't super cool at the
time you know no rear wasn't so use an
ear to the end and then yeah but if
someone in my family said don't do it
well okay to finish the introduction
tell me he's uh he's fairly fairly new
but okay I have a couple questions for
you though but I hit me um fairly new to
the TechnoBuffalo family yes the bird
yes I've heard ya heard yes there we go
yes so what are we the police force oh
oh but anyway the terrible super
terrible today you're right you're
absolutely right so um new to relatively
new you do I met him at the 1 plus X
event yes right I also shoutout to John
hopefully everything goes well with the
baby yes yeah jon rettinger whose wife
is like you said nine and a half months
now seriously she's any moment any man
she's a wonderful wonderful woman she
gave us goodie bags perseus to take care
of us that's awesome um how long have
you been doing this type of stuff I've
been doing a lot of video my whole life
I actually went to film scholar if you
know that I would mentioned you yeah
went to school Visual Arts in New York
and nyu no no nyu tisch has their own
film and video program school visual
arts is an entirely separate school so
that's where i went for a while i did
that i wound up in video on the internet
and marketing and then that wound up
going into startup culture i had to
start it for a while and then why on
that down wound up doing product
management and this past year decided I
don't want to do this anymore and I saw
a video of John's and I was like I've
been doing videos for a long time but
never professionally oh so I think I'm
pretty damn good at it so you should
hire me and are you talking to us no no
to John oh ok you looked right at me
when you said yeah I was like you want
me to steal you have Donna no really
awkward conversation is wrong with that
contact like strong i know'd in my eye
contact game is on fleek that's correct
usage rate ok so I'm again so I've been
trying to keep count of all of the
things that have happened on the podcast
for the first time he fleek is that's
the perception president yeah has
happened officially officially is there
a fleet counter now now it's happened
like four times i'm editing this has a
lot of work to do i think it's always me
ok go at the fleet counter right here do
you make some worse for you I'm not
gonna do it anyway owner / okay cool
well am really happy to have you on
thank you for having me okay and okay so
we do have a lot of topics to talk video
out we will get through them and we're
only five minutes in but I won't talk
about one thing I hate kate 88 where
now we're navigating this floor has gone
we're walking to adore you just might
have a security guard to get in your
face oh yes a no you can't go through
the oh yeah over there sir over there
sir I understand that there was can we
talk about the security at yeah
absolutely I walk through a metal
detector with my tripod and it didn't go
off so i think that there's a lot of
things happening here I'll show you
curity why's that I kind of have issue
the wavelength is just I mean like it's
just pinks and valleys it's like this
there's the converse when we were
walking in we serve we saw dude that
like this these doors are very clearly
roped off came out through the door and
just barreled in through the new the
rope and as I he regards like all down
you shut the door behind him and locked
himself he trap and himself against the
wall it took three security guards to
get him out well if you can okay if the
dogs okay if you can go up to the dogs
they employ to find bombs and drugs and
Pettit know that if you have the wrong
doc not mad at me they're like he's
working them because I said pet me yeah
I'm supposed to pet owners are posting
they're not supposed to let you pepper
correct that was alleged to be like on
point right his eyes LED pet me I'm not
sure there's there's such a thing as dog
eyes that that don't say that me know
the beagles at the airport they don't
want to be petted they're like I want my
treat Oh aggressive wow those San
Francisco because only thinking well
maybe no no no oh yeah I was walking
with Edgar we were trying to go from
here to the north holland back yes and
we could not find an interest in North
all yeah the exit only yeah you need to
go over there but there's actually a
special press store for their North Hall
that's my favorite no gical door this is
the special Prester number one favorite
door the only door I use it's a good one
because it comes out to like a nice calm
area uh-huh
hmm puts you right in right in the front
you can also get to the central area I
mean is this wow i just realized we're
having a full-on conversation about the
layout of the last name demented center
yeah we sound like California's going
you take the 10 to the 2 times and
exacerbate that's a real thing I've
experienced i melted I just moved to
California from Chicago previously I was
in New York and I thought the
Californians been on SNL was a joke I
thought they were just being so but no I
don't understand I tell you right now
think that you can use google maps yeah
I don't need a landmark anymore man
that's 2015 I just plug in where I want
to go in the internet tells me how to
get there absolutely yeah well
navigating this whole floor it has
always been the night Jerry yeah I think
it's been worse I just feel like ass
converse it has always been a nightmare
and them enforcing security entrances
and exits has made it actually even
worse yeah right because like they're
just like oh no you have to exit over
there I'm like you're just creating two
strings ID they're just even worse than
us just trying to like nimesh through
one door and like the las vegas
convention center has become like the
airport you can learn two bags yeah you
can wait one it has to be this big you
know when you guys come on on Saturday
be aware yeah exactly only held down
back only have one bag and like the base
has to be less than six inches I mean
they say all these things but we're
press we're exception though Oh are we
when they see the bullet when they see
the press badge they like clothes that
make sense because no i told i read an
article like two weeks ago that press
isn't set off bombs like press don't
know how and that set are they're
cleared by the government that's why we
get the green tag on our bag and we can
go and come as much as we want we can't
change the contents inside right yeah i
make sure that you can't yeah and it's a
very they run a tight ship through magic
yeah it's very very tight ship alright
cool so after that small ranch why the
three of us i will open up the panel
deep breath how second day we are in the
second day thank you guys by the way for
coming to our booth we r which is where
we are filming there so please all of
you on the audio podcast make sure you
get on to the YouTube channel began you
have been doing a full video podcast
every episode we're what yeah there's
been a lot of work but it's been really
easy you see what it looks like when I
haven't shaved in a few days you want to
check out the video
yeah look at the five o'clock shadow two
boys from now on here is little hot in
here seventy-two hours shadow shadow
yeah anyway yeah the booze has been
great we have we have this we had this
is where we've been conducting a lot of
our interviews and all that but we have
been able to talk to people like the
likes of some high-end people from
huawei ZTE i got to have an interview
with somebody from WP WP see mmm yeah
they were able to tell us about wireless
charging and he's it was super
passionate oh my god he was so awesome
he's like we should have smaller phones
with smaller batteries but sure wireless
charging everywhere I should be right
here there should be a package that you
know you're super he was super awesome
but what has been sort of the thus far
hump day highlight so more for you guys
mm-hmm I feel like someone asked that
question I feel like it i'm taking my
show back as well cuz i got to watch it
back oh yeah yeah but also you know you
could ask the questions but as long as
they know who you are first I can't have
that happen I can't so what does a good
is the coolest thing I've seen one of
you guys even have you enjoyed um it's
it's from yesterday so I got to check
out the LG 18-inch a rollable flexible
display yeah I liked it a lot I mean it
was it was beautiful that color
saturation really good contrast job and
in the really really really long session
afterwards like and I actually like
force immediately it wasn't really was
really longer we're gonna show you a LED
vs LCD and we're gonna make you believe
that everything should be OLED okay
right for like literally five minutes
with those clamps on yeah and goodies
for TVs and literally we're all like we
can see the reliable display there like
in an hour like I mean it oh yeah so we
had to have some of the indoctrination
into OLED first but then when I got to
the relevance lab let's be real as long
as putting her water in your eyes yeah
but I mean like the way that it pulled
it out and then in the in the session
after how they were talking about how
they were coming up with new ways to
close the air gaps right and how oled
doesn't have the same problems as you
can hang it from ceilings and everything
like that for does I just write more
innovative uses but when they were like
you know what the air gaps that were
doing on smaller panels to like decrease
decrease like the like the gap basically
so that things really a little more
vibrant for smartphones and tablets I
was like forced like no we're we're not
committing because we were just a
component maker and someone would have
to come on board for this right but it's
kind of in our roadmap right
unofficially you know what i mean so
like we have curved displays but there
but they're hard yeah it's like tell me
like oh we have this flexible display
limelight flexible when you made it put
in my pocket see you see the first
person who gets a flaw a curved TV
interest that's a recipe for disaster
yeah exactly so to me that was the
coolest thing because like one step
closer to really cool-looking flexible
color yeah let's yeah yeah I think we're
almost there I think there's there's a
lot still to do I think there's a dog in
the dog Oh someone said someone's a
banana in there in the bag okay this was
my dream where's my treatment no okay I
was they look fresh fruit I was telling
a story to Edgar earlier that what time
when I came back from Shanghai on dog
went nuts on this like healing Chinese
what it's like like a carry-on bag and
the dog was going nuts and she's like
takes it out and hit single man like
bananas are like the number one dogs
like dogs like the airport's forget
about bananas they freak out I had a
banana in my bag 18 hours before i'm
done with all the good
up my favorite part of the ones that the
TSA person came over was like ma'am you
can't bring produce from another country
which is true you can't then she's like
leave it there I'm gonna come back with
a bag one on one of those plastic bags
leave it in and while she's gone you
know this woman maybe didn't know that
much English she grabs and tries to eat
it I'm learning so much room and it's
used a brush like no don't you see her
duty Wow hi will now I know yeah bananas
be very careful yes banana phones having
no we want to go near but yeah we're
very close to be ID but actually dude
when when I when I can look at my wrist
and see an honest-to-goodness like
rollable display yes when I take it off
and like sent some that charges like
incredibly easily not just the rollable
and flexibility aspect of things though
but when we get to the point where
AMOLED displays are all over not just
Ola emily is the you know we see them in
phones all the time now but we're still
not there yet we were talking about the
Robin earlier yeah I'm gonna get to
where we have AMOLED displays in models
of that price point yeah Robin's 400
bucks yeah I want to see and that's why
the X yes what's so exciting for me
because I love seeing AMOLED on a
display that the true blacks just yeah
that's what gets my goat yeah Lex yeah I
had a go got a gun I mean I probably my
hope was that you answered by the way or
no I was just all usually greet your
being with it okay so so what what is
what I was tickled the fancy hasn't
worked I I honestly I'm a gamer dude i'm
a gamer and you're a gamer common dude
or you're both okay i had a razor has
been doing stuff from this tell me yes
good answer good answer they already
have an ultrabook why are they call you
there first because because this is this
is a different kind of computer it's it
is it is it they did have an ultrabook
it yes the blade the blade yeah I'm
stealth is even smaller and the IO on it
can handle the core and what's in it's
not even so much at the stealth is
what's really exciting the core is
what's really exciting uh I oh is now at
a point where we can just plug in a
graphics card a high-end graphics card
as if it were just a hard drive just
like on the surface book just a sort of
sort of it attached to attached attached
right i mean like the the technology is
there the pack is there the issue is the
surface book really sucks for editing
it's the adobe integration is not strong
it'sit's CW creationism is not on
Twitter yeah it's not a all week so so
everything after that after the show
I've I've been complaining about how cuz
like I flew to New York I bought a plane
ticket flew to New York bought the
surface book for an adding machine i
have the exact same when his john and we
were talking about it last night yeah
how we're just like you know what it's
not that strong but um no no no no but
but but the interesting thing is is that
the way that the OS integration on the
service book is yeah you can't you can't
push it into high performance mode and
plugged in not plugged in it doesn't it
doesn't affect the render time right so
these i was complaining about it
sometimes is they're like well
the graphics card in the size and all
right so these guys tell me cut some
links about how to push the service book
into high power mode to enable faster
render times okay so i wasn't gonna try
that before CES so after CS i'm gonna
try to hack my server if you get it to
work please let me know I will I cuz
we've had a miserable exciting we have
to surface books and we been we bought
them to do see ya yeah Fredo me but
hasn't been great when I'm trying to do
hopefully tomorrow I already shot the
video for the blade stealth because you
know how they have their gamers playing
like fall out and stuff over there
editor's can use graphics cards do you
know I'm gonna head over to the booth
actually use it to cut the mineola mount
it oh and we can make a video but using
the heating making video but it didn't
know actually I was gonna make a video
about telling you about making the video
about it yeah yes and then luckily hated
that to josh josh is making a video now
oh yeah there you go Mike
we're so just total is episode met along
with some metal flake the counter so
high up I think it's double digits at
this way yeah I think I really think
that's the coolest thing I've seen so
far there has been other cool stuff the
kodak super 8 camera that they suppose
it's in digital as well as dope i was
talking about again the robin earlier i
fell in love with it actually one of our
mobile editor Todd uh oh yeah balanced
on tight to todd todd Hazleton todd todd
todd has no tom hahahaha yes i SAT
beside him in a press conference one
he's such a sweetheart and he is a
sucker for phones believe it or not look
really the article that he wrote up
after we went and brief the Robin the
the headline is and he literally did
this while we were there he decided he
just bought it right there it was like
on his phone I'm trying shooting b-roll
and he just says the Scott he's like I
just bought one did it he sold me my god
so we really really worried i think i
think i was worried about them i really
was but yeah i think i think they've got
some cool tricks up their things i agree
i agree there's one thing that i do want
to talk about it if I can if I can do
this so it's great potential yeah well
it's it's a slight topic change but it's
something that we're talking about
before that we said we would bring up
here yeah I want to make sure that we do
yes and it's my love of emu I on the
made a yummy and Huawei products right
Zoe III love hallway and Harley tried by
the way I was going oh well I don't
understand how so many people at CES
hate oh my emotion UI and love them why
do you like it um it took me a while to
get used to know app drawer so usually I
don't like phones that have that but a
little bit like the timeline and when
you pull down for notifications it's
really smart the camera the camera is
really nice um just and I can find stuff
like cuz a lot of times when there's no
timeline or just right now after I'm
like where is that app right I just let
my cuz i like how do i find this right
but they have smart for a smart smart
search functionality for me to be able
to find my apps and most up most app
drawer list phones don't have that
so this you know I love can take I know
but why do you hate it I'm gonna temper
my emotions because here i have not
given it a fair shake and I it deserves
it deserves an open mind so we have the
mate 8 at that I'm gonna be reviewing it
i have not had an opportunity to really
dig in okay if if I feel the same way as
you do I will public um back onto on
this show and and proclaim my love item
thanks for covering your mouth cuz that
way you can cover it up with you're
always welcome perfect I like the even
we like it's not bad and but I will
admit that I put Google now launcher on
it yeah but everything but everything
else is good yeah I mean that yeah no I
mean like if if your Google now launcher
Carson nothing I mean I mean Colorado's
were so as I was oh I was I was gonna
say like I don't shine like i'm on i'm
using an upper right now as my i still
haven't moved on the the r7s really i
still haven't moved off of it had to be
super honest yeah that has saturday i
just have any touch it so like the thing
is like I just didn't move on to it so
the phone that I moved into after I
reviewed the r7s was the Microsoft X 950
XL yeah the XL yeah I haven't reviewed
the 950 XL it was a disaster all right
how do you mean the exit well it when
you hold it it makes sounds oh sure it's
great yeah well and and then like cuz
it's red sometimes the OS doesn't like
to move and to say you're like oh
they're in my via shears the page no no
your we're gonna okay now right right
right daddy I realize this is android
authority but yeah well we're windows
phone right now we're hating on windows
look man for you guys have such great
ideas it's just execution right now what
do you mean you're a Windows Phone me
they have the unicorns are some great
ideas wow he really does okay that's
fine no that's fine we'll move on i
don't know that's totally fine hey let's
tell you it's your show I have eyes
actually have reviewed a windows phone I
remember I mom dad loved that video of
such a leader and and one of the first
conferences that Josh and I hung out was
it was an ephah in Berlin and he was
wearing this Android a 30 t shirt weer
just came to the Microsoft dinner he's
like no I don't think I can emma gets
fine we just come to the Microsoft in
and so he's outside the Microsoft dinner
trying to like button that picture yeah
I had a spare shirt I luckily I don't
know luckily but I had a spare shirt in
my bag and it was just this black button
up and I was like oh I'm gonna get my
ass beat look like oh you're from Andrew
no no the buyer the folks at Microsoft
of always been quite kind to us well the
best part about that too was I I did
that then I had my card and I was like
hey you're already synonymous well you
know the person takes a card and there's
like oh thank you yeah okay over
there yeah I was really at the corners
or uh no I I really have no I have no
qualms with with windows yeah right now
is not the time to get back into it I
mean welfare yeah well I am hoping so
hard that with the new architecture that
they actually because they many many
third-party apps have already said
Windows 10 on mobile has been enough to
get them to take another look at the
platform yeah and if they can get their
ecosystem to a place where I don't need
to give up literally half of the
services that I use yeah I would love
nothing more than tease it plus yeah the
band too it's phenomenal I want a band
to the Bantu isn't banned freak intact
we should just start a baby anything my
job my piano and sing cool yeah dude
he's he's a melody percussion what do
you do well I I took music in high
school and I pay the baritone okay okay
so we'll do ask abhiyan I love you guys
the tangents come so so fast up your
yeah the digressions fastball that's a
visa I wanted I wanted to bring it back
around to enjoy durand and productivity
so the the samsung tattoo pro right a
windows tablet right so interesting
because I honestly
tab pro top row to ya mo tip
protein-protein approach to okay okay um
cuz like on tablets I prefer windows
does as a Productivity like more like
this is a predictably getting thing I
don't I with you and then that that that
iteration of the remix that we saw last
night for kind of bringing together a
windows and mac and like iOS kind of
onto Android in terms of like just
predicted me that was really interesting
and then on the promo code of the hard
man the pro two on the pro to the
Android the Android iteration the
Android customization in bridging was
the smartest that I've seen for for
cross OS interplay right it's like
unlocking unlocking the tablet with like
your fingerprint and like automatically
sharing hotspot uh-huh right I just like
that kind of OS integration would
actually make me consider to carry a
samsung around when I'm on the go doing
business right so like just constantly
having like my towel and I Hucky I can
like right and like yeah every year
samsung has not been able to get the
Moby Dick yes nicole scott yeah i asked
me i am anti samsung no no felt no
public computers TD okay then the note
or the the series 9 hmm is that your
active isn't it this is my active oh no
it was i'm using his stuff you know and
its heyday I haven't liked samsung
phones since the galaxy s2 you liked the
st I like the camera on st was banging
for the time it was paying a bit more
the time for the time is by the time and
then the s2 is what the Galaxy Nexus was
based on yeah yeah yeah so that said I
mean in all fairness the Galaxy Nexus
lasted me a solid of two years like over
two years yeah my next phone after that
was a nexus 5 so okay okay yeah chalk

how much is this thing anyway he was
like oh don't answer any of them because
oh yeah this will be my AO so very so
this is the coolest thing you've seen
this is the coolest thing that I've seen
is me winning a concept so I count more
a raffle yet that totally counts so I'm
expecting android authority videos if
you like standing there with a phone and
unlike the drone like circling around
you like I made a contact i said hey if
you want if you give me a quote unquote
review unit and i will go ahead and film
videos using the drum yeah yeah and I
and I said to I know please make a
smartphone mouth mm-hmm i will really
yeah yeah no I someone gave me one and
then and then it crashed the drug the
gym crash the drone I crashed it yeah Oh
see that Darrell said oh it's about to
fly no the Bluetooth connected they're
like don't use it around buildings I'm
look this isn't around building ish
she's in the middle of Manhattan I don't
know billions you did you see the
fixed-wing dry no I didn't yet I have it
was pretty cool I think it's in North
Hall okay it's it's like gated in in
mesh and it it basically only flies in
their tools they have to it's like if at
the law okay cool but it basically only
because it's fixed wing it kind of just
flies in circles around the whole I've
seen people carrying them around I don't
know if I'm just lucky to like Connor
might be behind these guys when they're
walking places I'm just cook them like
you would we're constantly behind people
when we're walking places well we're the
same people the same people who walk two
miles own that's our inspiration that's
an inspirational quote of the day I
think we're always behind people when I
walk yeah I'm behind you man
showerthoughts I don't want it yeah yeah
it was gonna pound for you but they're
not there we go scoot away look at this
look at this you know if only okay
Michael the shout out to you man you

that you were here wish you were here

not i'm not gonna be on yours you don't
have to be on mine Oh fair enough yeah
that's a giggity and a fair guy so yeah
he's uh he's got his whole team here
anyway
I've been getting some people in and out
of this one something okay for the last
five maybe 10 ish yeah if you don't look
crazy on this one okay what was that
topic you were about to do before I
pulled my drone out I don't remember i
remember I'm so sorry um erro emu I know
oh that's all you want loving IAM your
elephant in the room yeah CES not
necessarily like the best event I was
hoping you were gonna bring this up not
as necessarily the best one anymore we
got to give it to the one company that
has really given us the show you gotta
give it a while oh yeah we have to we
gotta games I think we got Molly I think
huawei feel like they came out of
nowhere this year no oh so like book
both like so both phones that I carry
around because I can't I can't I can't
decide the p8 I love it so much i'm
carrying the mate s as well because the
cameras supposed to be better i can't
really see it p 8 is like the I don't
understand why they're saying the mate S
is for women are like targeted at women
I'm like the P the P eights it like
smaller and more pocketable so I don't
need to carry a purse PA the PA yeah but
you guys are the crappy one in the US
the real one from the rest of the world
is amazing yeah the main come a day tour
the you're saying the PA do hit me yeah
the pH cool gotcha small pocketable
amazing cameras are all in the middle
room yeah yeah well I know you're gonna
talk about like the the sort of demise
and CES oh well sure but that's it
that's it that's it that's a five pound
right yeah and and you know what
actually it's I do think Huawei has kind
of stolen the show this year but I will
say I was impressed by this up the el le
TV brought to the table is here there oh
yeah I put up I put up my review of the
la TV 1s beginning of december and I was
just like I'm so in love with this phone
it's so really I was floored and we
spent a good amount of time this morning
with the the promax money in it yeah we
got it off the tether we got it in hand
without being stuck just something and
it is well I had added a pecan did they
yeah I wasn't even uh we had a meeting
with them no no
whatsoever really then and then one of
their representatives came by you know
god bless her she came by she's like hey
guys we actually do have so come on by
we made them come here i'll just say
that what did that as you do that thing
was very nice I'm very awesome excited
to see what they do and we'll Park works
with them now I don't know if you know
him but he was at it that's exactly who
we were going today well his business my
still my god I adore that man that man
yeah I met him today oh really just the
sweetest guy John's known it for a long
no no so he used to have a site yes yes
I I noon for a long time they went to
Nvidia and like I was just like you know
what if you left nvidia to go work for
these guys like your instincts are on
point just like the one s was a killer
phone for the price point the the build
quality sets new levels for that price
point I feel like after everything I've
learned about will park today uh it's
it's it that he's one to watch if he's
looking at something paying attention to
something now I'm paying attention to
you will car watching you will park
especially what you're eating where
you're running what why he really you're
not you're done no you made it weird but
now he's not gonna send his review unit
I don't even know what you sang what was
that it was the change Nicole is
watching him in a weird way let's move
on I just misses facebook friend okay
okay he liked posts where he runs so
much oh so he's like in he's like in
love hot dogs mala him on facebook i
find out man I've no no idea where that
way he's not wearing her reading
anything here he's just good food photos
and reading in circles run perks okay
man you need to take the shovel away
from the cold she gets days I mean
blushing now oh oh she totally is okay
well my cans are claiming now so I feel
like a hurry up a fixie my show just
brings people together done oh my god so
close my Jesus Christ okay all right
well yeah we do have to give it to LA
way for a year for blue for just kind of
not really saving the show but giving us
something to be excited
about you know I I agree they also did
the hope of loving thing is like oh you
came over so he was a treat yeah here's
a dream a date yeah I'm here's your next
can we talk while we're still on huawei
talk about one more very important thing
the kirin that that's er that's their
own so I'm so excited about the cure
that's their own silicate 84 z four
cores clocked I think it or is it 2.2
for the the higher one and then the
other ones down at 1.6 to the off more
but that they're doing good work you
know the exodus line has been doing very
similar stuff there octa core apps but
I'm super soaked because I like Qualcomm
I like the products but me not to be
shaking in their boots yeah I haven't
been able to slow that thing down yet
yeah now and like it's what's what
what's even more impressive to me is
that like they've been able to clock it
up and get the heat issues down which is
rounding in one iteration right like it
wasn't like they tried it a couple times
like like like Samson at the externals
because i was because i live in asia
I've been buying the Exynos phones and
I'm like for a while now right I know it
doesn't work yeah I'm like this samsung
phone sucks yeah right and I didn't
really I I knew it was because it had
the shittier processor in it yeah but
that's another reason why I've never
really been so big on samsung cuz the X
denotes is just not it was it just was
not a solid person do you think that's
where we're going do you think we're
gonna see more and more companies start
to be doing top-down builds where
they're controlling as much as the
process as possible I kind of hope so
because I'm like yeah yeah no Delhi it
makes sense Apple does it these guys are
doing it Samsung's trying to do it i
don't like is you you know how to
optimize your device sure so you should
be able to you know and that's why i
like TMU I so much because they get you
guys are gonna love it good good thanks
for watching hey no kitchen here but for
real Hamid okay nosey mui mui easily my
family so i love i love u mu X so much
because like when you sit down with
their OS team they're like you know we
turn these things on we turn them off
and you guys are able to go into the
settings
and tweak the OS exactly how you want it
to get the power drain down so you can
get two days of battery on like a 2000
issue but like milli ampere back to like
not even into three or four thousand
sure right and these guys are packing in
massive batteries and then not paying
attention to the operating system and
the processor that's why I like it's not
okay now right so we do I have to get I
also give i will give Emily a little bit
of credit you know they it keeps it real
because when you open up that like
optimized optimism application it goes
okay you got your at forty-nine percent
you're gonna get eight hours of battery
life right you could get 16 if you did
this one thing this is turn off mobile
data they don't use your phone you're
gonna get a lot of yeah maybe you're
just gonna play Angry Birds maybe I'd be
honestly that that's all I know it
should just be an off switch okay we've
got six percent left the best
recommendation we can make for you right
now is that little power button on the
side appeared it up just turn your phone
off and turn on if you need a big phone
call I just remember opening that up and
it was like I hit the button optimizing
I saw them like no huawei are you
kidding me please tell me that someone
asks to you had a CEO on here oh yeah so
one that may mention of that right no
well Darcy was the one who oh right I
wasn't you yeah I think I yelled at you
owns happening that was the one he comes
by right over here like hey there were
shooting here guys yeah there's no
accounting for me and the guy on under
guy in the audio mixer was just like me
that's why we have the lapels didn't
hear anything alright well hey I want to
