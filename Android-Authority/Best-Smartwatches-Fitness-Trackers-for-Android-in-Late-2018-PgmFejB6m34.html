the wearables market smartwatches are
getting much better at tracking your
fitness and fitness trackers are getting
to be much more like smartwatches even
though that's a really good change it
can be kind of confusing to buy one of
these things so that's why in late 2018
we've rounded up some of the best
fitness trackers and smartwatches you
can buy so overall the best SmartWatch
you can buy for your Android phone is
this the Galaxy watch it's made by
Samsung it comes in two different models
you can get one with LTE so you can stay
connected to your carrier at all times
or you can just get the cheaper
Bluetooth model if you just want to
connect it to your phone now I like this
watch because it's kind of one of those
everything but the kitchen sink
smartwatches it'll try to do everything
it may not be the best in every area but
it's still pretty good at most things so
since this is a Samsung watch it has a
really nice display and that's one of
the best parts about this watch to be
honest also Samsung kind of pioneered
this really interesting way of
navigating around the interface you can
kind of scroll the bezel around to swap
between different menus it's actually
pretty intuitive so this watch was
absolutely packed with features and it's
actually a pretty great fitness
companion too it has a heart rate sensor
and a GPS module so you can go running
with it and track your distance now
before you go and buy one of these there
are few things you should know now
Samsung's Tizen is really nice to use
but it's significantly lacking in
third-party apps also the voice
assistant on the Galaxy watch is
Samsung's bixby and to be honest it's
pretty useless it's more useless here
than it is on the company's Galaxy
phones and that's really saying
something so if you want a SmartWatch
with a good voice assistant you should
check out the tick watch pro now the
tick watch pro isn't the prettiest wear
OS device out there for that I'd say you
should go for the Scoggin falster 2 but
it is one of the best ones because it
has this really unique feature it has
two screens an OLED at the bottom and an
LCD screen at the top the OLED is the
one that you'll use to see the wear OS
operating system if you're running low
on battery the OLED screen switches off
and the LCD one turns on and it puts the
watch into an essential mode basically
you only see the time and
date and some activity metrics mob boy
the company that makes the tick watch
Pro says the watch can last up to 30
days in a central mode now I should warn
you now is not the time to buy aware OS
device the tick watch Pro is the best
one out there
but Qualcomm just released a brand new
chipset and so we should be seeing a ton
of other wear OS devices come to market
sometime soon
if the tick watch pro is too chunky for
you if you have smaller wrists then you
might want to check out some of fossils
latest smartwatches or some of Mobb boys
other tick watch offerings if your main
goal with the SmartWatch is to use it
for its exercising features you might
want to buy a SmartWatch from a fitness
company and two of the best smartwatches
you can buy from a fitness company are
the Fitbit Versa and Fitbit ionic I put
these two on the list because after a
couple recent software updates they're
actually really good smartwatches you
can reply to notifications right from
your wrist and you can even pay for
things at stores with Fitbit pay your
decision to buy one watch over the other
will depend on two things do you need a
GPS and could you see yourself wearing
the ioniq I personally think the Fitbit
ionic is pretty ugly it's really boxy
and design and I haven't really seen it
look good on anybody's wrists the Versa
is much more approachable and it's thin
it kind of reminds me of like a weirder
Apple watch it doesn't have a built-in
GPS though so if you're a runner you
should probably go for the Fitbit ionic
there are a couple downsides to buying a
fitbit SmartWatch though the on device
software can be a little laggy at times
and since Fitbit is so new to making
smartwatches
the third party app support is pretty
much non-existent also you can only load
up one watch face on either device at a
single time and changing them in the app
is super slow if you're not a super huge
fan of the fitbit smartwatches but you
still want to buy from a fitness company
you should check out the garmin
vivoactive 3 music now there's one more
category of smartwatches I'd like to
talk about and that's hybrids now hybrid
smartwatches are made to look like
analog watches they don't look like they
have any smarts built in at all but they
actually do more than you think on a lot
of them you can receive smart phone
notifications and they also track your
fit
the best hybrid SmartWatch you can buy
right now is the Garmin vivo
R it has an optical heart rate sensor
and it even has this cool invisible
display that only shows up when you
receive smart phone notifications misfit
and fossil also have a couple good
hybrid watches that you should check out
but they don't have that display so
moving on to fitness trackers we're
going to focus on ones that costs
between one and two hundred dollars and
the best one for most people right now
is the Fitbit charge three in my opinion
the charge three is the best looking
fitness tracker out there
Fitbit lets you change out the straps so
you can make it as classy or sporty as
you'd like it also has a decently sized
monochrome OLED screen and that makes it
really easy to see notifications and you
can even reply to them from this thing
and I know this is a really weird thing
to geek out about but the software on
the charge three is actually really nice
to use it kind of makes it feel like
more of a SmartWatch than a fitness
tracker that's the really nice thing
about buying a fitness tracker in 2018
is that they're all getting to be a lot
more like smartwatches
they'll give you notifications and you
can reply to them and you can even pay
for things from your wrist now a good
fitness tracker has to be good at
tracking your fitness and I'd say the
charge 3 is pretty accurate it'll track
your steps and calories pretty
accurately and it's a really good sleep
tracker now I say the charge 3 is the
best for most people because it doesn't
have a built-in GPS and if you like to
run outdoors you're gonna want something
with GPS the best fitness tracker out
there right now with the GPS is the
garmin vivosmart now the garmin
vivosmart has been out for a little
while but that also means it's dropped
in price so you can buy it for just
about as much as the Fitbit charge 3 but
this one also has a GPS and it's pretty
thin and light too so the one big
downside to the garmin vivosmart is its
design Garmin didn't include
interchangeable straps on this so you're
stuck with this really fitness II
looking device aside from that the
garmin vivosmart is actually a really
nice fitness tracker and I would have no
problems recommending it to runners who
don't want a big SmartWatch on their
wrist overall the garmin vivosmart is
pretty on par with the charge 3 in terms
of fitness tracking accuracy the reason
why we put the charge 3 at the number
one spot is because it has better sleep
tracking
now let's talk cheap fitness trackers
because not everybody wants to spend 150
bucks on one of these things so if
you're looking for the best
budget-friendly fitness tracker you
should check out the Xiaomi me band 3
you can get one for only about 25 bucks
and that's kind of a steal for what
you're getting here the me band 3 tracks
all the basics steps calories burned
heart rate and sleep and it's actually
pretty accurate at tracking all of those
but that's all it tracks
remember this is 25 bucks so it's not
going to have as many sensors as the
more expensive options ok so that's it
