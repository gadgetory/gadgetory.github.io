just released today and you know what
that means
those of you with Samsung Galaxy s4's
are probably experiencing something
called phone Envy while all of those
Samsung Galaxy s5 users are just sort of
rubbing it in your face all like ok
maybe not but a lot of you out there
have been asking us if it's a good idea
to upgrade from the s4 to the s5 so I
wanted a quick fire off five reasons why
you probably should so it's Josh Megara
from Android authority what's going on
everybody and here are five reasons why
you should upgrade to the Samsung Galaxy
s5 alright so we'll start off this list
with what is on the surface and that is
of course the build quality now what we
have here is a phone that is very
similar to its predecessor but that
might be a good thing in more ways than
one after all by keeping the phone
pretty much the same size as the Galaxy
s4 the galaxy s5 has a handling
experience that is very familiar and
also is pretty easy to use in one hand
ultimately it's it's a form factor that
Samsung thing's if it ain't broke they
don't necessarily have to fix it but
there's even more to it than that
because the back cover regardless of
whether or not you like the perforated
design has a better feel to it than the
glossy plastic of the original but even
more on top of that and this is the big
one is the ip67 certification you will
have water and dust resistance on this
phone meaning that this phone can take a
tumble or even take a dip in the water
and it will still come back looking for
more and it'll still work just the way
that you need it to so with a little bit
of ruggedness available in a flagship
device you have a build quality that is
definitely leaps and bounds better than
the original and our second reason has
to do with the display now we might not
be seeing that big of a difference
between the two that's for screen in the
s5 screen because it's only a point one
inch difference in the size however what
we're looking at here is the continuance
of the Super AMOLED tradition after all
Super AMOLED continues to be one of the
better display technologies out there
that bring great color saturation maybe
a little bit more than you need but you
can always tweak it and also a very
vivid experience no matter what you're
doing whether it be
movies or playing video games with
colors that pretty much pop out of the
screen and punch you in the face
ultimately you're getting the same great
quality here from Samsung in their
displays and on the Samsung Galaxy s5 it
is about as fun as ever especially with
a few of the extra capabilities you have
built in like the air view or even being
able to touch the screen with gloves on
and still be able to register presses so
the displays our second reason for
upgrading to the Samsung Galaxy s5 this
third reason is probably personally my
main reason to upgrade and that is the
ISO so camera the brand new 16 megapixel
optics found on the back now the ISO
cell camera does bring a few
enhancements to the app itself but as
far as the app goes you're not going to
be getting as many modes inside of it as
you did in the galaxy s4 but for a lot
of you out there who probably never even
really used at those different modes
this might be a good thing because
Samsung went ahead and added in a couple
of actually pretty useful ones that you
probably will end up having some fun
with live HDR and selective focus but
it's all about the picture quality and
the ISO so camera seems to do the job
ultimately what you get in the Samsung
Galaxy s5 are a lot of very vivid
pictures with some pretty good color
reproduction and even if the detail may
not always be in every photo you still
will get a photo at first glance that
looks very nice and it's perfect for at
least social media and beyond but with a
little bit of tinkering and a little bit
of extra effort you can probably get
some spectacular shots from here that
can go beyond just your social media
experience so the SSL camera rounds out
the third reason why we should upgrade
to the galaxy s5 looks like the display
we're not really seeing that much of a
upgrade when it comes to the performance
but it's still a reason why you probably
would want to upgrade to the galaxy s5
after all a lot of you users out there
want to remain not just on the cutting
edge but you want to be as far to the
bleeding edge as possible and that is
what you get with this and every
flagship but the Samsung Galaxy s5 rocks
the Snapdragon 801 clocked in at 2.5
gigahertz like a champ
everything on this phone seems to go as
fast as you need it to and any lag or
stutter that you might find is inside of
the operating system the TouchWiz but
the reason why I bring that up also is
because TouchWiz is our final reason for
upgrading to the Samsung Galaxy s5 while
lag and stutter might
have plagued TouchWiz in the past with
previous iterations of the Galaxy S line
we don't really see it that much at all
in this one TouchWiz has been enhanced
with a with a better look that may not
necessarily drastically change the
experience but it is still appealing
nonetheless in places like the settings
screen that has the circles now still
very colorful and also the recent apps
button that allows you to use
multitasking in a pretty classical way
after that some tools that are added in
like the toolbox allow you a quick way
of getting to five different
applications and of course all of the
other enhancements that came in previous
iterations like multi window and every
gesture you may or may not use returns
in the galaxy s5 you have a
full-featured software suite in TouchWiz
but this time around it has been
optimized and at least from our
experience it is one of the fastest
iterations of TouchWiz we've ever used
and it's a bit of a feat considering
everything that it can possibly do and
finally these last two things I'm going
to name off are pretty much honorable
mentions because at least for me
personally they don't hit that top 5 in
terms of why I would upgrade from the
escort to the s5 and it's gonna be a
little controversial because they are
big additions and that's of course the
heart rate monitor and the finger
scanner now I've already gone
extensively about these and future focus
videos and in the full review but it
pretty much comes down to this
the heart rate monitor for those of you
who really are into fitness will not be
the best companion it's pretty much just
something you would use once in a while
if at all and on top of that you
probably have a much better performing
heart rate monitor that monitors
monitors you continuously anyway instead
of the one single reading at a time that
this one does and as far as the finger
scanner goes it is a nice way of getting
a little bit more security out of your
phone but to me it's kind of just not
something that I would use very often
until software updates come in that
allow you to use the finger scanner to
let's say input passwords or to get
through certain credentials in various
apps but until then the finger scanner
is just a bit of a extra way of
unlocking your phone but I just use
swipe anyway and so there you have it
for these five reasons to upgrade from
the s4 to the s5 there are a lot of
enhancements in the galaxy s5 from its
predecessor and I gave you my top 5
while mentioning the two big ones and
telling you why maybe they were six and
seven ultimately this is an upgrade from
the s4 and if the enhancements are
enough to make you spend that extra
money then more power to you but for the
rest of you if you don't feel like the
galaxy s5 is a real upgrade and you're
not going to be spending the money on it
let us know why in the comments below
and on the other side of the coin you
can also tell us what your reasons would
be for upgrading from the s4 to the s5
