by android authority discussing topics
in android every single week i am of
course your host for the ftp Joshua
Vergara what's going on everybody and
this week we had another live episode a
very fun one with a couple of special
guests we were able to get Darcy back on
because Darcy and I were here in China
in specific Beijing inch and Zen with
oppa for the launch of their brand new
are 7 and r 7 plus I hope you guys
enjoyed those videos already taking a
look at the phone for the first time
it's a pretty nice phone and we're
looking forward to our full reviews of
them in the coming weeks but we were
able to get together at the end of the
day at a hotel bar and be able to talk
about really just how what we thought
about the event the factory toward that
we actually got with oboe in that video
is coming very soon as well and our
thoughts on the phone itself we were
joined by jaime rivera of pocket now and
also james pick'em from pick'em i hope
i'm saying that regimen I'm sorry James
from tech radar and we did have a couple
of other people basically watching our
podcast so we had an audience for the
first time on the fdp and you're gonna
hear who they were at the end of the
podcast but the four of us were able to
talk for quite a while and we even were
able to have a couple of drinks around
and you'll hear it at the end we had a
toast in ordering our outro to this
particular episode I'm actually standing
in the hong kong airport right now hong
kong international hkg and i'm on my way
back home to Los Angeles so this week
we're actually getting a double feature
of the ftp you're getting last week's
episode as well which is our ask us
anything episode so I hope you guys
enjoy that as well and the reason why I
had to do a double feature this week is
because last week when I was finishing
up the podcast I was actually in the air
and didn't have any any chances to
upload the podcast but without any
further ado we have this episode of the
fdp the Oppo r7 and r 7 + not to mention
also our factory tour and office visits
with elbow hope you guys enjoy
yeah I know we've been talking about
the phone and all the stuff that's going
on over the past couple days but I'm
curious woods hear what everyone was
talking about what everyone felt about
the factories I'm shocked shocked I'm
shocked well this is my first factory
experience like ever yeah it is I it's
something that I've always wanted to do
I guess from the photos I've seen from
Parks con and all these other factories
I was expecting something more
rudimentary something more basic I mean
I didn't think that opal was this big or
at least this fancy I mean they don't
outsource anything they do everything
themselves um they I guess our biggest
problem is that we're not their target
probably you are in Singapore but then
the rest of us in the United States and
in Latin America we don't really see
opal products there but it does seem
that they do understand their market
that they that they are focused well on
their market and they are catering as
well as they can and you know for me
it's interesting nowadays most companies
just focus on making money and making
money is outsourcing everything sharing
the responsibility not having all these
assets and in order to free to drop your
bottom line not pay so many taxes and
listen this and that and here's a
company that's doing everything
backwards in a more intimate way with
employees with the production cycle with
commitments and I've always I've known
very few companies that do this but the
companies that do are the ones that have
grown substantially over the years like
I work for one UPS UPS is one of those
companies where they do everything they
don't know outsource anything and there
this is a company that's survived for
110 years so I do feel that for a
company that's this young ten years yeah
and for them to have a facility that
looks this good for them to have all the
processes and all the test procedures
that they have now at such infancy is
for me was shocking I was like I did
expect the season so good when we got in
like a whole day late because well this
place was flooded oh yeah but I know dad
but the thing is obviously there was a
very limited amount of time but and
obviously when it comes to stuff like
this they're only gonna show us like a
snapshot of what the entire operation is
you can't help but just think of the
scope yeah that was one floor yeah we
saw like maybe like eight hundred to a
thousand people and there's 20,000
people oh yeah oh my god it's crazy the
testing procedures and everything I mean
just speaking to what i was saying
though you know feat shock know when we
attended Huawei's meeting to her they
wouldn't even let us photograph or
videotape anything yeah this is this is
incredibly gracious sir yeah it so her
like so transparent it was kind of
shocking and they made it very clear
that nothing that was shown to us was
proprietary by any means but I mean we
were like up front center with you know
the bear materials that they use you
know every single step of the way like
they actually manufacturing every single
element and going through all that
quality testing I mean how many
companies use an odm right they just ECT
HTC does it's extremely common for
companies to use ODMs to share
responsibilities and to not be part of
the whole process you know I mean even
clothing companies I mean Tommy Hilfiger
whatever brand you can think of Gucci
Prada and tongue they all they do is
they hire they look for an odm they show
them a couple of samples and they're
like oh I'll buy this I'll buy this all
by this but it's not really their
creative process it's not really their
manufacturing process and I I really
commend companies that are willing to go
the extra mile yeah it makes
end of the day right you're not going to
turn the OPA phone over and see like
designed in California you know but what
are they a whole but you know it's it's
really easy for a brand to be diluted in
a market like this one given how much
competition there is and that's
something and the last thing you could
say about an opal product is that it's
cheap it never feels cheap no I mean
we're looking at like basically a super
mid-range phone as foreign box yeah and
it packs a wallop in hand I mean it
feels the r7 initially I didn't like you
know the bezels I feel like it looks
like a poem from 2013 well because we
have them all in our pockets on all
right yeah yeah look at it yeah we could
draw our inspiration right now that's a
one in the meeting with the design guess
I guess my my perspective on the r7 is
because i use the r5 and i really like
the r5 i was like ok they took a step
back i hate but it's it's it's some
nights I this its perspective you know
whenever you see something big you it's
like if the iphone got smaller on the
next generation you know your immediate
perspective will not be positive it'll
be negative so it's just that it's the
fact that they reduce the size of it if
they would have kept the same five point
two inches they if they would have
figured out how to keep it ask them and
just nothing's it solutely 6.8 at no six
month for six I can't remember exactly
yeah we should know i know i'm pretty
sure it's been a long few days it really
has and I know few is not even the word
just described me here for like two day
yeah no time at all really 24-hour Hall
to get here
well I mean I may have the worst of it
no comment you saying with this mouse or
something yeah you can look back on it
like this are our resident bread for
today just chillin on the side and
actually he says I don't know if I'm
going to put this in the beginning or at
the end of the podcast with us talking
about our age this is a youngest one
right yeah 22 22 I'm usually the
youngest wipes they can get a whole
naughty 25 25 yeah yeah I know 20
fighting a quarter life quarter life
crisis but shut up what i would give me
imagine being the phone you know if
you're one year old do you feel really
old oh yeah you're like old news nobody
wants to touch you that should be a new
term article years that's my goodness
like told me like a channel is the only
Road that would not even see the only
phone that would be the exception is the
LG g2 people are still going I'll ratio
that for long yeah I love that you said
that because now Nicole is going again
yeah she was planning on the two of you
talking about the g2 on the date I know
but you know one of the best ones ever
made in my opinion first with OAS 1080
battled killer battery life and now you
can for like hundred eighty bucks out
you and I love the feel that phone
I I don't know it was just something
about the materials of the felon even if
a pod blasting I don't know what it was
but it just felt really good I felt
substantial everyone was really like
weirded out by that back but just
nothing yeah but actually get the hammer
man taking quick quick oh yeah here in
your pocket likes throw their money and
you don't even need to just double tap
to wake the front of the functions to
love it because I'll go g-packs to it
vote it it's just that that about yeah
puppet show and the following raucous
was that and plus the whole idea that
like monkeys and that the g2 and the g3
before the g4 like is anyone else sick
of having to don't like the double tap
to on the volume down button to open up
the camera and the double tap yeah you
can do that but so not reliable holding
it down like in the g2 g3 so much better
yeah honest girl I think what's wrong
with that is what is it about you gonna
be able
so tell us so you don't think that's
that's truly the case of any way you
know back on topic here like you we
didn't hear from you James about how you
felt about the factory you were right
next to me text napping away yeah you're
taller than me you swooped me on 18 feet
18 feet I just try to take a bridge of
years and I could just see his hand
above me like oh that's a disguise yeah
early convenient right come yeah it was
/ /strong I they've done as well when
again those I was impressed against got
to see so much and then we got to
off so much well it really didn't fit me
with less less it's just song yeah we
were rushing it a little bit yeah I
don't think I think we rushed for time
more than anything
the brother being for sure but yeah I
was I was very impressed by the amount
of sleep I care what do we do yesterday
Milo's before the launch what didn't be
awesome it's just a shirt he was a champ
and we what we looked out that was
amazing we actually worked out with
private with high made with Armand yeah
alpha male Hercules open oh boy we've
compressed so much in such a short
period of time it feels like it's been
like a week here's nice it was still
conscious have you done sleep I'm
surprised I'm selling like you know John
was telling me just about like I was
asking you know cuz i was looking at the
faces the workers you know and just
there's so many of them and they were
looking at us kind of like where you
know we always VIP caps on everything
but i was asking you know tell me about
like the workers like are they happy
like are they were compensated and you
know he went on to tell me that do dave
from where they come from you know they
receive extremely good conversation and
they are allowed to encourage to bring
their families out accommodations
provided you know education facilitated
health care provided and you know they
really want to have like really happy
workers and when you have companies that
just produce a creative idea autocad III
design and they outsource to an odm like
they feel like the soul is caught yeah
there's the soul is on transfer but with
company like oppo you know it's kind of
like UPS is it completely or mcdonalds
even if you entered a vending company
everything is controlled from the top to
the bottom and
I don't know for me like all the phones
have an extremely nice styling I don't
know there's like the certain gymnast or
flop yeah yeah even just holding this
are seven in my hand just like this
might be one of the best feeling phones
I don't know what it is like what
whereas curves are like the in thing and
everything you know just just a nice
flat device sometimes you just don't
really do it and even then I'll both
trying to put herbs in here 2.5 team
quietly hard like I use it i'm still not
sure about that just 2.5 d back because
you just said that yeah what do you
think about the price point i think it's
very competitive really honestly i think
it is but when considering considering
that the quality of the design material
you know because we have what's the
other alternative the two hundred fifty
dollar idol three artists and we have
the same witnesses yeah and they have
the sympathy idol three is not in this
market is not not particularly and adil
face plastic it's plastic it does and
doesn't but it has the same specs IPS
exam ember this is a nice old self
camera we have to prove RGBW that one is
in IMX i think it's a prevent certain 15
yeah it's like the really low sodium low
mid yeah so at most yeah i mean looking
at it in a scope I mean you're obviously
paying for less things in the lesser
idol 3 but with that in mind you know
pain paying for this kind of premium
call yeah I think it takes it makes
sense you know and the plus + and the
plus which I got my I got my question in
at our dinner so I was happy about that
I really wanted to hear what they were
going to say about like the our sudden
plus looking like a camisa like I really
wanted to hear what responsible
and you know what hurt the answer was
correct in our did you justice we're
just trying to provide what our users
and if it turns out that the design is
actually kind of falling in line with
what is already available then okay it
makes sense right now if you had to pick
like if they could only send you one for
review which one would you ask for I
would say the r7 plus because I focus on
the camera so much yeah and it is Sir it
is the up though it is the better camera
objectively that's borne off
so I am I'm kind of confused I thought
that the ISO self-censor the samsung
isocell sensor was superior to this sony
IMX well of course that's going to be
the claim but it's the construction in
the sensor and I'm still need the design
is very controversial talk exactly the
possible the sign is that idea was still
you know kind of debatable whether or
not it was subjectively better than
these other sensors I mean okay there's
two things need to be talked about first
is samsung doesn't actually have any
public disclosure or the fact that they
make the thirty- size or so on the
product page sure she's a stop talking
about to avoid completely cell and the
second thing that's connected is that
the galaxy s6 which I think we all agree
arguably has the best camera any Android
from the world but that's sick ons
except they alternate between the ISO
cell and the mx2 40 and according to
that as I read some sony financial
transcripts they ran out of imax to
foist answers as they sold so many Asian
partners instead of Korean Carter's over
the last six months and that's why
Samsung is a source of but nobody
complained because the quality is so
stellar them both well if we're talking
about the s5 you know just putting this
example out there the s5 is still a
great camera and it's proved it's all
truth it pull out the Apple you ring up
the war I saw something up say the s5 my
mom just went on a trip to Scotland
Ireland and the UK didn't bring a camera
with her just brought her s5 and a
selfie stick mama like that came back
those are some of the best photos I've
seen and after I taught her like rule of
thirds oh yeah but she she she was able
to come back with a lot of great photos
that she didn't
who needs a real camera are you starting
to become that way i think these are the
times when you don't yeah simply too
absolutely and but okay going back to
the topic of the r7 in our seven plus or
any of you disappointed with the fact
that there are bezels on this display of
the r7 plus on the r7 not so much but on
the r7 plus am what I feel the other way
around they are silent is too aggressive
in his bezel in arson plus when I'm I've
and one at five inches in Gallagher's
look well put that so I guess I was a
little so I would if I had to pick I
would definitely pick the r7 plus yeah
not because of the camera I just I
really like the sea added security of
the fingerprint scanner that's me in the
rain yes yeah and the laser focus right
so those are the two things and that
4100 milliamp hour battery that's the
thing that must be insane say they've
stacked the deck because it's 4,100
milliamp hours with Luke Hardy that's
ridiculous well that would ensure god
it's not i think that's like a great
thing you know my name is Hal to and
then as hell but doesn't mean point some
for me I guess you know I'm glad that in
the presentation they didn't sit down
and say we are launching a phone without
bezels because there are bezels on the
outside macross you know even if you
know we hiked the rumors that there
weren't any well there aren't in the
chassis design but there is this huge
black bar around the display within the
Cassie that that is pretty much a bezel
that's just not covered by white film
but these are peasants how about the
presentation what did you think about
the lunch no no now keeping in mind that
they were celebrating a 10-year
anniversary yeah they do really push it
lat much today was quite I think it did
I think they do it was quite it's quite
humble at the same time I'm sorry oh oh
you think humble shower decoration I
said I'd the movie moments where they
just kind of said yeah we know you've
done this problem and ok i'll talk about
they'll arrest the first thing all over
ya mean you're not really a child yeah I
think yeah this is sad well yeah you
really want to start them up yeah the
first thing they said is like we've
received a lot of complaints okay it
might be true but what I would keep
remembering from it is in this what I
haven't I haven't really had this
experience with a phone company launched
see Samsung where you had a host that
had to react to the information she
obviously knew Yeah right like oh we're
gonna show you a video and she'll come
back on stage and go simply amazing haha
ok yeah I'm sorry miss desensitized to
Allah so I think I don't know I think
that and for those of you who didn't
watch the event weren't able to see it
it was more of a Q&amp;amp;A than anything else
I don't I don't think that was an
interesting structure I don't think that
was necessary I think that it would have
been like you never see Q and ice from
anybody you know from the higher end
companies they are like these are new
strategies this is what we're doing
we've heard some feedback and this is
the new product the problem with the q
and A's are that they wonder around and
you know even just call the middle man
to come up with Fox and make you down to
ask the question this is there are some
pretense that's why I think exactly i
don't think it was necessary i'm not
going to criticize the event I guess I I
just feel that it could have been better
and the fact that it didn't really need
a Q&amp;amp;A could have been a quicker event
more practical I mean they were so off
focus with
you know with asking the guy different
questions and stuff that we didn't
really get the meat over how a lot of
things are being implemented I I'm a
communication major I'm always don't
notice those kinds of like you know this
is always like the underlying toxins but
that being said the event was pretty
supremely hell yeah not really much
beautiful look we were there at the soil
or launch and wow that was a crazy town
like this those nuts about knowledge
like oh yeah yeah do you think all out
you know I'm cracking up over that
moment where you're like you're like
wait for it wait for it they're gonna
launch the phone either from the sky a
little bit from the floor and then all
the media ladies and gentlemen we you
can come take photographs and then
everybody would just go crazy walking up
the stage and interrupting the event
yeah like I was waiting for that test
that's because the end one wasn't the
one that was the end one the one that
came from the ceiling yeah it was the
fire and 30 and why the entry or the 57
was a poinsettia
coming up a really oh sure because okay
so the story behind that the story
behind that is I remember sitting in the
aisle during whatever launch time
someone say it was in one or 57 my point
soon and I'm sitting in the aisle and
they're all like ladies and gentlemen
the Oppo find 7 and then I just saw this
box slowly appear to my right number one
I was freaked out but at number two this
was the worst thing that could have done
us fire code regulations and the house
goes everyone take a look at it for the
next 10 minutes and the press I had 20
people strong on my left ready i just
got all that device and me i had already
got my pre briefing i didn't need to do
anything right i got trampled just
trying to like walk over me oh my god
that's the phone even knowing that we're
gonna have an experience that I suppose
I guys like this video but Oppo does
seem to seem to go home yeah just a
little time and even for something that
you could say is great but it says a
thing like we're learning devices which
what's this whole thing about blurring
the lines so much mid-range on the
inside feels as it tell me is just tell
me something I mean I know lollipop has
balls and I know there's always prompt
so if that phone with its current
specifications were running stock
Android when you consider it to be mid
range
as long as it's a very snappy experience
no as long as it goes smoothly into a
point it goes nuts an iphone well we're
talking about two completely different
ecosystem I know to completely different
ecosystems but you know like the higher
and windows phone is a mid-range android
phone and the same goes or we don't I
know but but I guess the point that I'm
making is I don't consider that to be
mid range I suppose it depends on your
scope Snapdragon from 0 to 8 15 like the
600 is usually considered a little bit
more made 400 as the budget phone yeah
this if you if you were to consider the
600 like this compared to let's say moto
g yeah this feels more premium this
feels like a more higher-end and if it
was stock Android and this performance
smoother than the Moto G did then yeah I
would say it's still a higher demand
right like they say though the
three-year by Iran the difference makes
the substantial and 615 is 64-bit
capable processor so it's in a way
better performance than even if it was
like a SAP carrying 800 which is a
really great processor still gonna be
better than in terms of thyroid and
power efficiency yeah and but the thing
is to your point and an apple phone
the iOS is engineered to not have to
take up as many resources as what
Android us after it is a unix based
system it almost runs a little bit like
a pc in the sense that when you are in
an app it has to take up a certain
amount of memory has to conserve his
plan and run in the background you know
iOS is a unix based system is what it is
I mean it's now I get your point I'm
getting like I'll see what is it 756
megabyte of RAM yeah what in the world
yeah which to their credit is incredible
the same time it's you know there's two
different ecosystems I'm talking and the
camera on this phone man on the earth
seven it looks identical yeah it took a
lot of elements from I they were really
inspired you know what really i mean
though i didn't i didn't feel any
submission because those things are were
in previous versions of color wise
especially the recent apps wearing rings
yeah but yeah it's been in color OS were
no for me hello color wes is the only
thing it's gotta go i tried during the
Q&amp;amp;A don't like this one stuff i tried
during the QA to be as polite as
possible over how much I despise look
kind of the icons float up ooh nice no
Harrison hate it but I mean it looks
beautiful i know it's it's really not
the fact that it's that your i think
that there was a time when android was
horrible back in the time of any mario
back in the time of froyo better the
time of eclair it was horrible yep
that's it made sense then came
gingerbread then came Ice Cream Sandwich
interpret and it was like okay there is
no more need for HTC Sense back then it
was necessary at the times a froyo you
remember that but afterwards it wasn't
so man sends back then
thank you but compare sense yeah exactly
since was a million times better than
stock Android anything was better than
stock Android and so you get your here
now given given the option to I mean do
you really need color OS I mean lollipop
is in my opinion personal opinion so
good-looking that it's not necessary for
userspace it with knowing that here in
this market we're sitting in right now
in the middle of gin gin China that if
you had stock Android without Google
Play services you know i would just true
here you're making a good point there be
an amazing fun yeah you know what I mean
they kept talking about cuz consumer
surveys you know no I understand it all
based on age and no and that's what I
told them I that's what I told him in
the Q&amp;amp;A it's like okay I do know that
you guys have gotten your market figured
out but you guys want to expand yeah
global incident yeah so what I was like
okay if you would at least give me a
stock Android skin color OS fine but
with a stock Android skin how difficult
could that be release an app drawer this
is the jelly penalty on the mega thing I
don't really miss the app drawer it's
funny I really don't list that for me as
you use an iPhone half the time well
yeah I think I'm on fire we got to sit
down with the designers we asked some
really good questions dare cross have
some really good questions us excellent
I mean Connie you're always on fire
you're like the Jesus of phones but
anyway yeah anyway I answer the question
cuz they're all like yeah customers want
simplicity
and so I asked my eyes what about the
theming engine what about the ability to
control more yeah and then they just
completely didn't answer my question and
how do you think I felt yeah I wanted to
I wanted to hear from the horse's mouth
how their camera software is engineered
really what things are are you looking
to compensate for in what might not be a
great photo straight from the sensor and
when I got was it shoots video yeah they
totally totally ftp tub and at your
truth to that two hours they did man I
mean the whatever they didn't whatever
they were smoking or snorting or
injecting I don't know but it was not
good I didn't but the thing is I were we
really what what was I really surprised
that that was the response i got no of
course i know it was just it was just
another disappointment that you know if
feedback is very important to them then
we should be getting the same exact well
i mean everything's can I hear it I know
what to do the next time I come to one
of these my told gene but you know I
guess I'm wondering if they were really
expecting this to be a session feedback
yeah maybe so i went i left her because
i think it was more like a verbal
commercial oh it's like a verbal
commercial and it fires your imaging 2.0
or 2.1 or what made you come up with
color west 2.1 you know i guess they
were expecting those types of questions
and then here I come and I tell why is
the camera on the engineer so bad one
day the company that even if their
cameras shitty the company that gives me
a straight answer as to why they made
their choices
emre is the one L respect to host and I
told James I want to come in with like
11 by 12 photo 4 by 3 aspect ratio
whatever from the camera that could be
considered mid-range like they say Moto
G yeah come I'll blow up a picture from
a moto G put it right in front of them
and say notice in this picture you have
like a lot of rain here you have details
aren't really great the color
how would your camera what would you do
to your camera software to make this
phone it's like when I asked them about
the HDR I showed you my hdr photos from
on Dora I mean there's this like white
bridge in the middle of the of the lake
you can't really even see the damn
bridge and so I'm like okay it becomes
pointless free d have to add HDR it's a
really dark day I wanted to pull out to
not over bloat the white of the of the
bridge with a shot and HDR just
completely destroyed the photo yeah and
so the either response was that they did
that intentionally because it's what
their customers want and I'm like okay
I'm I really don't understand the
purpose of crappy HDR something that
customers would really want but you know
I I guess I felt a little down played
with the comment that that the guy said
he was like oh I'm a professional
photographer and this invisible is and
I'm like okay I'm not a professional
photographer 99% of your customers
aren't either you know it's great for
you to have a thousand shooting modes on
your camera but the problem is that
people don't really want that what is so
special about the galaxy s6 what's so
special about the note edge what's so
special about the iphone the fact that
you don't have to be switching around
modes to get the right shot at the
moment that you want it all you do is
you pull a damn camera out and you clip
the eat a professional photographer is
not going to be using a smartphone to
take an important shot you'll be
carrying his DSLR that's just the way
it's going to be I mean the whole notion
that a professional photographer will
endorse a smartphone camera is a little
bit ridiculous to me because the
professional photographer will still go
to an event it was still good yeah the
money so yeah I mean obviously that's
part of it but that that professional
photographer will obviously go to an
event that he's getting paid for and use
a real camera
from camp yeah you know so so it's
always going to be a ridiculous notion
because the professional photographer
should be able to see that this photo
from this phone doesn't matter what code
it is even the nests six or an iPhone
and think yeah I won't ok you know so
that's why I just thought it was odd
yeah because consumers just supposed to
take a picture that car as soon as
possible exactly the cat is currently
are static he's not moving now I'm too
fast they're just hustling when this is
over laptop oh yeah now you see like a
TD visa yeah each is crazy i like their
i remember when i started use him
desperately yeah Ichigo Ichie automatic
i remember when i started using the note
edge i was i was in barcelona and there
was a sunset of everything and it was
just amazingly beautiful sunset and I
just remember that moment when I pulled
the camera towards the Sun and the and
the software immediately drew the Sun
immediately marked you're pointing at
the Sun i'm gonna i'm going to
compensate for anything else and I'm
like this is it yeah and that's why
you're rocking that yeah this was it
they figured it out you know it's a
fundraiser stroke it is hahahahaha and
you can okay so I remember there was a
time when I would I went on this trip
with the family with the Lumia 930 but
to test the rich capture features and i
guess that i took a sony nex-5n that I
had that I have and I took the Lumia and
I took photos at the same time and the
Lumia would automatically underexpose
for the lighting and then the end in the
Lumia sorry then the sony would
underexposed and the Lumia would
automatically compensate for everything
and so I'm like this is the thing it's a
smart phone you have the opportunity to
process after you take the photo and
give users a better photo that
compensates for everything that's what
Lumias do that's what the galaxy s
that's what the galaxy phones do now
and so that's the thing it's like there
are times when eating smartphones can do
a better job because they have the
processing power and it all happens a
real time it all happens in real time
you can't you know what processors or
what what the technology is in is in
cameras right now you don't see that yet
or at least that's what I think I'm oh
that's the reason why I gave LG so much
credit yes because they actually said
the things I photographers wanna hear ya
lower aperture doesn't make sense
without a bigger sensor what else they
actually need they mentioned the very
notion that smartphones are trying to
touch it it's good we just got a flash
we have a bit of an audience for our
show today their tech bloggers yeah well
it's still a group of top of tech
bloggers but the thing that I loved at
the OG events and this is what I'm
looking for when I ask the questions
about smartphone cameras is just
something to dis elect oh yeah obviously
smartphone cameras these days are trying
to make easy the craft that people like
hearing learned over years years of
practice the world of
now it's just at your fingertips you
don't have to know it no one thing right
and I have a little bit of a nerd moment
here yeah so the best research dick
tastes like iphone 7 and I hate you die
phone but like the fact is they have a
conscience billions dollars to catch the
disposal but the next major breakthrough
for smartphone cameras has to do with
something called a MEMS sensor and
manage MEMS is really special because
MEMS the periscope design it seriously
all shape not quite like that MEMS are
highly miniaturize nano for lack of a
better term I wouldn't use word
particles but MEMS essentially it
miniaturizes an SLR type lens and it's
able to how should I say basically
you're able to increase the focal length
and manipulate that within a highly
militarized package and with that you're
able to go as low as like f like zero
point B
and with that f-stop like you're gonna
be able to create crazy bouquet yeah and
also be on that too now we're going to
be looking at like double or quadruple
test image sensors so we're finally like
by 2017 2018 we're gonna be dealing with
like digital SLR quality if you guys
don't we see the term members last year
they did yeah mmmm just come and gone
but it's like it's really difficult to
work because you're dealing with the ton
of moving parts and it's all where was
it where was it that it was it was in an
apple patent yeah and i think it was in
a samsung patent as well yeah Samson's
making them Sony's making them sony has
industry leadership insurance remember
excuse me camera sensor yeah but we
really begin to see that it's so much
money selling off the cameras but I
guess the point that I I guess the point
that i'm looking for is and by the way
disclaimer i have no professional
photographer or I'm not gonna let me
reveal now you got me looking I
did the shoulders you do you say you
have everywhere pocket out please yeah
there you said that and it's been viewed
by millions of people mod pronounce it
correctly right metal you better can't
do that alright that should be willing
to do the ftp intro with you later sure
we can get you so so here's the thing
truly smartphone cameras are not DSLR
yeah that's not gonna happen that's
never gonna happen but here's the thing
they don't have to be they don't have to
be
23 how many how many people could afford
a DSLR 20-30 years ago you remember how
much camera equipment will cross 30
years ago its thousands of dollars yeah
we've never been in a this is this is
the best time to get yes yes what about
the whole Sony thing you know I've ever
seen Ken home he's a global
communications director LG he was
insulting Sony on facebook saying like
who's going to pay 240 dollars for a
portable image sensor Bluetooth that has
f'd stop of 2.8 like chicken or chief or
you know it's got one point isn't it
phone when we're very going with that so
the point is it the I don't think
there's a need to compete with an SLR
you know there is a market for us a
large just like there's a market for
race cars there's a market for SUVs
there's and there are people out there
the major the average consumer doesn't
want to call a huge camera I want to
carry the most practical one they can
carry and have it do a good job yeah but
then in your right but all I ask all I
ask is that you draw your inspiration
from the DSO true and make it clear true
that's not that that's a valid point and
I guess the the other point is that you
know even though sure you have to draw
your inspiration I think that next year
or probably later this year is going to
be extremely interesting no five yes the
note 5 but it's just samsung and LG have
graced the bar so oh yeah god blessed
that god bless them
you it is just I guess that was the
point that I was trying to make to oppo
today you cannot launch a product like
the m3 or make it the m5 next year and
launch it with a mediocre camper it is
just pointless yeah particularly the n3
or the future and five whatever the
number is going to be that phone is
really the novelty is really the camera
there is no points for second place now
when it comes to camera quality like you
said you wanted to champion the camera
so hard because that's not her you know
motorized we're getting camera it has
all the hardware necessary to be so
excellent but then the sauce they just
went and I'm just going to say they've
 it up they put the same software
of every other events that's what I'm
saying like software has to add the
software as a draws inspiration right
from what look at how a even an
entry-level canon yeah j pathol 100 yeah
JPEGs about you know and and mimic that
do that yeah in the scope of your sensor
that's all I want to know is what's
happening alright this is not gonna be a
super long ftp this week but it is a
double feature so i hope our audience is
enjoying your hearing this clinking hard
hard from Cheers yeah we're getting
worse we have is we have slipped we have
a two person audience we had a
fourth-year who didn't talk that much
sorry items but i am going to give
everyone a chance to give their there
just are seven hour 7 plus starting with
your verdict you first look verdict
we're doing on for review soon but I
mean there's lots where we are Josh
there's a lot of things that go into the
sea no I'm always focused on the
business end of things go to market
strategy all that lame but in
reality like consumers who want like a
really good mid-range phone you know
they're going to do the least path of
the resistance to get that home and so
it all depends on localization for
American consumers you know they have
the same time to launch now 199
excellent phone battery life's
questionable I still don't believe in
Intel's mobile strategy like the battery
life sucks but idle substrate there you
go excellent phone I mean equivalent
specs for the most part except for the
AMOLED screen and the subpar which I
thought the AMOLED screen was a nice
time but they'll have the price yeah
dude is that that IPS display on that
that alcohol was really good it was good
it's probably one of the best IPS
displays IPAs accent I mean I'm always
looking back you know I lick the
flagships from two thousand thirteen and
fourteen like the g2 would be awesome
but focusing on today and focusing on
you know what oboe is done I think that
they've done an excellent job and you
know consumers do actually don't care
about specs they're gonna go you know
ninety percent of the world's consumers
who aren't in the united states are
gonna go to a you know a stand that's
like glass and they're gonna pick up the
phone and they're going to feel the
beautiful yeah pradesh about to say
either didn't see so many users just
give it experience extremely three
colors of it the rapid camera love it
and they're gonna be extremely attracted
the hour seven people easily in asia and
developing my yes in from i think is hot
item i commend them for bringing back
the headphone jack yeah that was made it
up and speaking to the larger picture of
what they've done here like having
attended a lot of media workshops in the
past like the fact that they were so
transparent
yeah and they were so open and just you
know human and willing to admit their
mistakes along the way and let us talk
to the designer like I was really I
don't know the whole soul of a boy like
I really got to say that really ever
since the beginning with the 55 you know
I really dig it right really have it
really take it okay and yeah of course
this is samsung camera and yeah this is
samson panel but like they put it all
together in a way that a lot of
companies never could have done so i
recommend yeah all right oh you'd pop
okay so while you play with the Lycans
yeah yeah right i got dark officer um so
your time they don't have a big that
it's not what you want to say before I
ask you how you feel but was a lie this
is not this is a different so is the
question are 74 awesome plus in general
like how would it work what are your
thoughts if you give me give me few
thousand phones because we get we gave
our thoughts about to the factory tour
in the event yesterday what it do don t
0 to n 32 and I'm used to be impressed
I'm I much prefer the plus personally
there's because of prefer the big screen
our fingerprint sensor just some play
around with it I'm submitting at the
most time with it but it seems to be
really reactive seek to be kind of what
kind of perfect for it yeah just prefer
the whole look at the part of the look
of plus or everything but the r7 is
still useful but it's still you've got
right there but it's just yeah it's just
I agree everyone's going to book them to
walk into a shop pick that up and go
yeah I've kind of happened that's yeah
yeah I'll be fine what days are going to
worry about the software I don't worry
about that yeah i mean what's the device
of the future supposed to look like yeah
transparent piece of glass that has
hollow elements on top of it you know
and right now you're looking at one of
the thinnest phones that are available
that kind of gives you that somewhat
sense of feeling just imbiss and doesn't
feel like it's gonna fly over hand they
just have to which is nice can you can
we excuse the camera considering the
price point and considering that this is
supposed to be classified as sort of a
mid range hood but by the way I mean if
it's a nice I have we have further
testing to do yeah dude I mean this is
what it's Peavy what what stages in it
and it's no photo software well haha
dv/dt i think yes so the it's it's real
we can't judge it yet yeah we can't
truly church wedding is in one in the
few pictures that we have been able to
take over the last day or so like for
the most part it hasn't really
performed too badly yeah so I don't know
how to anything horrible yeah yeah that
kind of I've had good and apart kind of
we're not really Barnard real bad
exactly nothing for breakfast and then
you think about yeah and it's easy to
think like oh we're in a good place
where comes the cameras and software for
the math but I matter buddy hammer us
when you think back to like 55 you know
like I remember the fine five is one of
my favorite phones ever but I came back
camera which is ignite yeah I second
eyes out i agree i think that i think
that the r7 is nice the r7 plus yes it's
I still can't not see the mate 7 in it
yeah which is the reason why in terms of
design I focus on the r7 more yeah and
it's it's a it's an engineering feat to
me because it's it's just so simplistic
it's very thin feels wonderful in the
hand the the thing that I can't stop
doing on this phone is pressing the play
really there's so many like the sound I
see pleased with it right press it all
day like a third in the factory over
they have that machine that pushes the
buttons like for 42,000 machine I just
10 but really the the phone just feels
so nice amoled screen at five inches
1080p the right now you can call that
the bare minimum and by its it's the
greater and the camera as long as it
performs pretty well I think we're going
to have a pretty good device here at
like what yeah you know I'm looking I'm
constantly looking for phones that if my
girlfriend or my friends into trucking
oh it's all good yeah yes by this time
right now the idol 3 has that crown yeah
at 250 but you know eight hundred
dollars more this is this might be a
holic device you should know I was gonna
end on you I mean like at your your
verdict it's my verdict whoo I like the
are 70 I would recommend it you know
actually sorry I don't do that i just
wanted a store clerk doesn't really
matter that these are capacitive keys
compared to soft are we only really up
in arms about this debate okay so here's
the thing like I've always been against
capacitive please always particularly
because if your turn it like if you're
holding the phone to try to take a
photograph it is extremely easy for you
to press these buttons and leave the
viewfinder you're playing a game and it
is extremely easy for you to press them
to leave the game it happens to me all
the time and that's the reason why I
like either on-screen buttons or a
hardware physical key I just realized
who they don't line up yeah and then
neither did they in the r5 they didn't
because it out because i found the
chassis was and so I would I never liked
capacitive buttons so no i don't i don't
like that those that's actually one of
the reasons and sorry i like the r7 it's
not a bad phone on the contrary it's
very well designed i feel that they were
fine I thought that the r5 was very well
refined and they just took us the
further and focus on things that are
important like the headphone jack but I
think that the r7 plus is just so
futuristic you know the the design of
the display is just so futuristic
looking that I I could just not stop
looking at a display I couldn't stop
looking at the display this looks so
lucky you call a big batter yeah if
you're just staring it yeah and if you
know a lot of people are going to be
like oh it's only 1080p and I'm like to
you are not gonna see pixels stop
complaining what you're not gonna see
you're not going to see things stop
complaining so again in my case I are 7
plus but just because I'm a geek okay
sounds good well obviously this entire
group is Pam we're sitting with right
now we're going to get our review unit
soon enough we're gonna give you all of
our with you as in all of our final
thoughts but yeah just it's been one
hell of the last couple of games yeah it
really has and it's one yeah it feels
more like a week skills exactly which is
which is the reason why we are recording
outside of where we're staying yeah in
the middle of the night at 1am almost
and right now it looks like we're about
to have shots is going on my way to do
shots live all the hookups of course if
we'd this our ending and this is Petra
it's very its range certain degree i was
going on alright well let me do my outro
we're gonna end it at the end right so
yeah all right um i want to give a
thanks to our audience here i will have
named you guys off at in our intro as
well so i'm gonna go and let them know
who was around or the ftp today i want
to give James a nice tilt tell them
where they can find her tirade oh um
well how do you guys yeah in social
media Twitter on Twitter I'm James rwp
I'm a you can write a traitor alright
closely and of course hi maribel
yeah the distinguished and distinguish
underscore Rivera on Twitter or hi mera
neta on Instagram awesome it was we're
ever get Darcy back on the show and
that's so that's so that's really
awesome and it's good that we always do
it when we're together rather than
telecommuting it you know which is what
the ftp you thanks guys yeah all right
well don't think you guys enjoyed the
ftp a little bit of a shorter episode
for you guys but it was also a double
feature today because i gave you last
week's episode also why did you get last
week's episode I was in the air when I
wanted to I was busy in my business
class seat business to be I got a
bathroom seat like better but that was
in cargo Wow so I hope you guys enjoyed
the double episodes of the MTP that were
available today and yeah remember if
you're on the YouTube channel you'll see
a little bit of extra footage or intro
ahead not just me but Jaime are on our
intro that we're going to do in a few
minutes or in a little bit
whenever and yeah keep it tuned to our
YouTube channel complex our video
