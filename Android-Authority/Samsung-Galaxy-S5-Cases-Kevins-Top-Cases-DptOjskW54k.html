name is Kevin the tech ninja and these
are my top aftermarket cases for the
Galaxy s5 the first case on my top cases
list is the ten dollar cruiser light TPU
case the cruiser light cases are always
a popular choices for a number of
reasons the price simplicity and color
options also it has the signature
Android design etched into the back of
the case
the lightweight TPU material does a
great job at covering the whole device
it creates a lip so your device is
slightly raised which could save your
screen from scratches when it's lying
face down the material does not add
additional weight and the back is grippy
enough to feel confident when it's in
your hand the cutouts are present
although they are not as precise as I
hope they would be you look at the
bottom you can easily see the cut isn't
even which allows you to see more of the
bezel than you should really see the
cruiser light is a decent case and for
ten dollars the price point makes it
easy to ignore any downfalls when it
comes to rugged cases the $35 Otterbox
case is one that comes to mind
although the s5 is dust in
water-resistant some people want the
additional peace of mind as well it is a
two-piece case one part is a hard
plastic which acts as a backbone and the
other part is a soft yet durable
heavy-duty rubber the rubber fits inside
the harder plastic you simply put your
phone into the rubber part of the case
and slide into the plastic backing the
styling is what you expect from OtterBox
it uses subtle lines as design element
is not super attractive nor is it ugly
the case delivers on the promises of
great protection the large lip around
the screen should protect it from drops
and also the speaker and camera on the
back is protected due to the thickness
of the case the cutouts on the bottom of
the device appear to be a bit large but
that's due to the thickness of the case
they're actually cut very well with this
type of protection you should expect it
to add some weight and bulk which it
does but if you feel you need the extra
protection then this is the case for you
the virus store is a $15.00 hardcase
epic named aside this case makes my list
first it has a lot of choices for
different colors second although it's
not advertised it is a two part case the
back acts as a shield and the soft
rubber surrounds it
this ensures that the easily chipped
chrome bezels are protected and it also
protects the screen when you're lying it
facedown
it does not protrude as far as the outer
box but it's enough to make you feel
confident in the case this case contours
on the side which supposedly allows for
a better grip when using it for a few
days I got used to the curve and
actually did enjoy it the cutouts are
attractive and has their own styling to
them the buttons are covered and allows
for easy presses without the initial
break-in period as you see with other
cases the case feels durable and should
protect the device in the event of a
fall it's a great mix between a slimline
case and also the durable outer box this
last case is actually my favorite case
and it could be found between 16 and 20
dollars depending on the color
it's the spigen ear cushion slim armor
this case and the V restorer are pretty
similar the slimmer case is also a
two-piece case with a hard perforated
shell in the back the buttons are
covered but also angle to give them a
unique style the buttons feel a bit
mushy but the distance it needs to
travel is less than other cases so it's
actually does not affect the case at all
the cutouts are our circular design
which gives it a clean look the slim
Armour is a bit thinner than the Thor
and also the bezels do not come up as
far the screen is still protected pretty
well the bezels do raise the device up a
little bit but I don't think it will
protect it if there's a rock on the
ground and you drop it or if there is
some debris on the table you set it
facedown that debris will contact the
screen because it's only raised up a few
millimeters all in all this case is my
favorite due to the lightweight slim
design and also the unique color
combinations and there you have it that
was my top cases for the galaxy s5 as
always if you own one of these cases
make sure you go ahead and leave it down
below and let me know what you think
about this case or if you don't have one
of the cases leave it down below and let
me know what
do have so I can check out that case as
