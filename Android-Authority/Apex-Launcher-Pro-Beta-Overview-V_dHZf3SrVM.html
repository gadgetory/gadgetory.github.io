this is Clayton with Android Authority
now today I'm going to show you the apex
Home Replacement launcher and be showing
you version 1.0 dot 5 as well as the pro
key beta version that's available for
testing now a lot of you may know that
this requires Android 4.0 at least or up
because this is an Ice Cream Sandwich
full replacement launcher so any of your
devices running custom roms with Ice
Cream Sandwich roms on there can get
this launcher and you Galaxy Nexus
owners can as well so first off I'll
just take you to the apex settings we'll
go over some of the basic things having
to do with the apex launcher here we
have our home screen drawer dock folder
behavior advanced backup and restore and
then our about an hour restart Apex
Launcher so I'll just walk you through
some of the simple stuff first I'll
actually go into the about Apex Launcher
and show you that I'm running the Apex
Launcher version 1.0.0 beta now this is
basically the same as the 10.5 except
for it has a few added functionalities
functionalities excuse me which I'll go
over so going back I have the home
screen settings you can see that we can
choose our number of screens and go all
the way up to 9 5 -5 because I won't
need that many we have our default
screen that we can set out of 9 we
choose which one we actually want to be
our home screen we can disable the grid
size so you can kind of just put a I con
anywhere we have our number of portrait
grid and our number of lands great great
icons so we have the functionality to
put as many icons as up to 7 here and
then as many as up to 7 there and so
that leaves for a lot of a squishing but
if you have your pixel density changed
it will look very nice anyways we have
our horizontal horizontal margin which
you have options to set all the way from
none to large I want a medium simply
vertical margin our preview animation
here we have our infinite scrolling
option which I'll show you right now as
I go all the way over through here it
just keeps going and it restarts at the
right when I scroll all the way to the
left you can see my little my track
right there goes all the way over
anyways back to APEC settings and our
home screen settings we have our elastic
scrolling which gives a bounce effect
like a rubber band when you're scrolling
through and our minimum scrolling time
can be changed we have all sorts of
transition effects now a lot of these
are included with the apex Pro beta and
not the version 1.0 at 5:00 but a lot of
them are so a lot of the cool ones I'll
just show you the cross because it's one
of my favorites and you just swipe like
this and it brings up your other apps in
a cross fashion just kind of on a pivot
right there 360 degrees of all your apps
so that's very cool I like that a lot
you will go back into our apex settings
and there's just a lot of cool
transitions you have your tablet with
the glass windows kind of like on the
Galaxy Tab or things like that your card
stack which is the stock Galaxy Nexus
transition cube in cube out accordion
overlap wheel I'll show you wheel for a
second then we'll get on with the review
and this kind of just brings it in like
it's on a pinwheel just like that
anyways the Galaxy Nexus is powerful
enough that it can it can properly
render all those transitions in correct
time but if you have a phone with maybe
a smaller processor you might not want
to do some of these crazy transitions I
in fact like to just keep it on the
tablet um anyways you can show the
desktop indicator which is what I was
pointing out when I was going through it
just shows you which homescreen you're
on um home screen indicator position is
always on auto on mine at least you can
hide your notification bar shadows and
icon labels kind of cool for some I know
as to our drawer settings we can show
hidden app icons because we can disable
apps with Ice Cream Sandwich apps
sorting our entire title they're sorted
by title we have our drawer style excuse
me which is how you would scroll through
your drawer we have our drawer
background transparency meaning we can
go all the way down to zero outside of
that 48 just for that good for a second
here and show you what it would look
like now you can see in the background I
have my my wallpaper still there instead
of all this black stuff so that's pretty
cool you can set all the way down to
zero so you have a pure transparent app
drawer like that anyway so I'll go back
to my apex settings I'm gonna have
infinite scrolling on the drawer and we
can have a primary and secondary apps
tab and the secondary apps is sort of
like sense where it shows you which apps
you have downloaded as well as hide app
labels hide widget labels labels excuse
me and all sorts of cool stuff like that
we have our dock settings where we can
choose our number of dock pages and
number of dock icons and as well as
infinite scrolling and just the same
thing as pens a lot of the home screen
options like that so that's what this
would look like is you can go through
like this and have multiple ones of
those so back to our apex settings we
have our folder settings which I will
show you super quick that I have square
folders like that with sort of a fan
preview so it's not the stock Ice Cream
Sandwich looked and feel to that I will
show you how I got that right now going
to folder settings you can go to folder
preview and select stack
and grid or the iOS style I like fan and
then you can choose the folder
background and I chose square you can
also choose iOS ring or none or a custom
one you can choose from your gallery but
I like the square hidden folder name and
hidden icon name basically you have your
behavior settings which is gesture
support pinch in swipe up swipe down two
fingers swipe two finger swipe down
desktop DoubleTap just to talk long
press draw button feedback all sorts of
different stuff you can do with that
anyways you have your advanced settings
which allows you to choose SMS count
unread SMS count unread miss excuse me
miss call count under a gmail count so a
lot of cool stuff like that as you can
see here it is uh letting me know that I
have a text and if I were to have a
missed call it would display that here
and if I were to have a missed Gmail or
another miss but an unread Gmail it
would be right here anyways coming back
to the apex settings we have our backup
and restore options to restore our
profiles on the Apex Launcher and we
have our about Apex Launcher Pro now you
can see here that we can check out a lot
of the features within the apex launcher
pro this is basically just a quick
overview of what you have with the pro
license version here's a small demo of
what our unread count would look like
and all of our gestures of course we can
pinch in sort of like sense to show our
preview and we also can have one by one
widgets here in the dock bar you see I
have my beautiful widget for weather
this is what it would look like if it
was out just grab it drag it down to the
dock bar and there it is I have another
icon in there but a lot of the widgets
are poorly formatted when you were to
put them in the dock bar so for example
I will go here and I will choose a
beautiful widget and I will do a toggle
widget make it for Wi-Fi for the heck of
it and as you see here I would bring it
down and then we sort of have just a
little cutoff like that but mind you
this is the beta version so I'm assuming
that that's going to be fixed and we
possibly will see even larger widgets
available for the dock bar such as a
four by four four by one excuse me
widget down there and that would be
cool so anyways guys that was the Apex
Launcher go ahead and check it out today
you can get it from the Play Store or a
lot of custom roms come with it already
also to get your free evaluation version
of the beta Apex Launcher you would go
to your apex settings then you would go
to your about Apex Launcher it might not
say Pro at this time and you can check
automatically check for updates and you
will want to press beta version because
if you're choosing the stable version it
will not give you the option of testing
the new beta and then you can check for
an update now and it will tell you that
you have the most up-to-date but you can
choose the evaluation version for the
beta Pro now anyways guys I hope you
liked the review

everything of the sort so catch you
