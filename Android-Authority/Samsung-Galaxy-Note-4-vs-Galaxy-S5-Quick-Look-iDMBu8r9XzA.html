in this the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 versus
the Samsung Galaxy s5 as these two
flagship lines continue to evolve they
are starting to really distance
themselves from each other especially in
terms of design the galaxy notes for
aesthetics aren't a total departure from
the s5 but there are major differences
particularly the note 4 having the metal
frame now which gives it a wonderful
feel and look all around but also having
the full leather design as opposed to
the galaxy s5 it's dimpled back though
the leather does look quite different
when compared to the note 3 originally
with the front side both Samsung
handsets have essentially the same
iconic look with the physical home
button flanked by back and recent apps
now that being said the note force front
features what Samsung refers to as 2.5 D
glass which means that the edges of the
glass might have a slight curvature that
makes it look even more appealing to the
eye
obviously the Galaxy Note 4 is the
bigger device making it to the preferred
choice for those who value that screen
real estate and don't mind a bigger
phone but while the galaxy s5 focuses on
being the every man's phone with
features like IP certification for water
and dust resistance the note 4 lacks
this and thus sets itself apart not with
it but with a tool for business users
and creative types in the S Pen now the
obvious difference between these two
flagships is the fact that the note line
generally is larger than the Galaxy S
line but both would still provide those
beautiful crisp Super AMOLED displays
but of course Samsung has turned up a
bit with the note 4 giving it a quad HD
display in this 5.7 inch screen now
resulting in a pixel density of over 500
pixels per inch on the other hand the
galaxy s5 is 5.1 inches in its screen
and comes with 1080p resolution but the
differences aren't really that
noticeable unless you're really looking
for that being said however the note 4
does have a great screen on it and we do
enjoy what we see from it in between the
two it basically comes down to size and
whether or not you want a smaller or
larger display as is found in the note 4
as far as performance goes the scales do
get tipped in favor of the newer device
as is usually the case and the Galaxy
Note 4 now comes with the quad-core
Snapdragon 805 processor as opposed to
the 801 that was found in the galaxy s5
now there are absolutely no issues with
the performance of the galaxy s5
obviously even with the heavy TouchWiz
UI
but overall the better processing
package of the note 4 should make things
even better especially considering that
4 gigabytes of RAM are available for
even better multitasking which was given
a focus in the software section of the
note 4 now when it comes to hardware the
note 4 does come with 16 32 or 64
gigabytes of storage while the s5 comes
in with 16 and 32 but both of them have
expandable storage but in the battery
department the note 4 is getting a trump
card here with fast charging technology
which we have been told will fill up the
battery up to 50 percent in just half an
hour and we're really excited to test
that out for ourselves in camera it's
about time that Samsung finally adopted
smart OS or optical image stabilization
now in the note 4 which means you'll get
even smoother video and clearer pictures
especially in low-light situations as
compared to the Galaxy s5 which had a
pretty great camera on its own already
but you do also get the bump to 16
megapixels on Note 4 and on the
front-facing camera you get a bump up to
3.7 megapixels and 2f 1.9 aperture to
really take advantage of the selfie game
and you can see here on the note 4 we
also have an added in 120 degree
panoramic selfie mode that will allow
you to really get those group shots
perfectly just by tilting the phone so
the camera experience has been greatly
enhanced the note 4 though its quality
should be on par if not just more
enhanced when compared to the already
great Galaxy s5 camera experience and
finally make it over to software now
obviously the Galaxy Note 4 comes with
the S Pen and S note features which
truly differentiate itself from the
galaxy s5 which does not come with the S
Pen but still has many of the same
multitasking features however in the
note 4 they have been improved as the
multitasking can now be triggered inside
of the recent apps area for easy access
to the multi window which then provides
easy access to creating floating apps
for a number of different applications
so you could really cater the
multitasking situation to what you want
it to be but when we're talking about
the S Pen and the S note the note-taking
apparatuses have been improved a lot
here not only with the Air Command
providing the smart select but also with
features like the snap mode in which you
can take a picture of in a surface that
has writing on it and will be able to
detect the handwriting and be able to
make an editable S note for you to be
able to customize
while the galaxy s5 definitely has many
of the same capabilities when it comes
to the note 4 in the note 4 they have
been further improved to make them even
easier to use which to us might be
enough to really make the note 4 over
the top and so there you have it for
this quick look at the samsung galaxy
note 4 and the galaxy s5 with a lot of
new additions in the note 4 that really
enhance an experience that you might
already feel familiar with we really do
think that a galaxy note 4 might be a
pretty compelling case for an upgrade
especially with things like the fast
charging and also the new multitasking
capabilities that really make it even
easier than it ever was before on a
galaxy line so keep it tuned to Android
authority for all of the best coverage
