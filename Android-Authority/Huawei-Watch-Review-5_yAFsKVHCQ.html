on in smartwatches this year there
always seemed to be going round and one
of the first ones that we were really
intrigued with was one by Huawei now
Huawei may be not a company that's
really all that known in the West has
been really making waves with the
SmartWatch that a lot of people have
been clamoring for hey it's Joshua
regard from Android authority what's
going on everybody and this is our full
review of the Huawei watch design is the
crux of the Huawei watch experience and
that was pretty obvious when we unboxed
it after all even that was a pretty
luxurious experience the design is of a
metallic body of course with a round
face right here that has sapphire glass
covering the screen and there are nubs
on the top and bottom that curved down
in order to meet the straps one button
is at the two o'clock position and it's
very large really not all that shy about
its appearance and has a very meaty feel
to it now those nubs on the top and
bottom do allow for an easy change of
the watch straps which are standard and
they also have quick release bars so it
is really easy to change them we do
think that this executive design for the
Huawei watch hits a lot of the right
notes this in particular is a tuxedo
like design that has the silver and the
black in its leather strap but we do
think also that because it feels quite
luxurious it doesn't necessarily meet
all of the different style standards if
you have everything from business casual
to the fanciest of clothing then of
course this is going to fit right in but
if you're really slumming it it might
feel just a bit out of place think your
typical gym clothes and whatnot now we
did also get a different version of the
watch in hand this time with a snapping
metallic band though not quite on the
level of the Moto maker for the Moto 360
there are a lot of options available
aside from these two you're seeing
silver black and rose gold finishes were
coupled with a number of watch bands and
you can get them all in a number of
different colors but they will make you
shell up a lot more depending on the
style that you want now we were
introduced to the Huawei watch a while
back and we did think that it was one of
the first smart watches to get the round
design right it does have a very classic
look and feel to it but then has to
contend with the tropes of being a
SmartWatch the nubs on the top and
bottom curved down a little bit but seem
just that little bit out of place to the
rigid line
that surround the actual screen itself
and then the fact that the watch has to
be as thick as it is just over 11
millimeters actually detracts from the
overall look because this is one of the
thickest watches that are out there
don't get us wrong we do think that the
Huawei watch is one of those examples of
a seamless melding of classic design and
current technology unfortunately that
has just as many advantages to it as it
does disadvantages now one place where
there was a great choice in this watch
is the AMOLED screen this 1.4 inch in
diameter screen comes in at 400 by 400
resolution meaning this has one of the
highest pixel densities that are
available in a Android wear Smart Watch
today and that means that text is going
to be really crisp and easy on the eyes
and pretty much everything is readable
and the viewing experience is pretty
great but also the AMOLED display
provides a couple other benefits not
only is the screen going to only turn on
the pixels that it needs to show the
display it also will help with battery
life which we'll get into a little bit
later and while the screen does make
viewing quite great it again tries just
a little bit too hard though without an
ambient light sensor here the screen is
left at the user defined brightness
making the user micromanage the watch a
little more than might be desired you're
pretty much going to have to change the
brightness to what you want it to be if
it's a little bit too bright or a little
bit too dim for you but thankfully there
are no problems viewing the screen in
daylight so even if it's a little bit
powerful in the dark you're not going to
have any problems when it's really
bright out now it's a little tough to
talk about performance on an Android
wear device because there isn't much to
do on one other than swipe around the
different notifications and cards and
then occasionally talk to it that said
however the Snapdragon 400 processor is
backed by half a gigabyte of RAM and
this is the package that you're pretty
much going to expect with most Android
wear iterations today and in our daily
usage there still weren't any problems
getting applications to load having
notifications pour in and even
occasionally getting our health metrics
in a way this is a benefit of Android
wear the performance aspect is pretty
reliable no matter what watch you get
and the Huawei watch is of little
difference here in hardware we are
talking about a pretty standard package
that you would get with any other
Android wear device now the heart rate
sensor is something you would find here
and it is actually a little bit more
accurate as Huawei claims because they
added in a second one and I did check it
against one of my polar
heart rate monitors as well the margin
of error happened to be pretty small so
I would say that this one is pretty
accurate there is a fairly large battery
in here and with the Super AMOLED
display it does get some pretty good
life
however the charging cable that comes
with it is proprietary there no wireless
solutions here it has a magnet on the
back that has to latch onto the back of
the watch and then connect a few pins
the problem is when it does latch on to
the back it might not actually make the
pins connect and in that case you have
to double check if it's actually
charging if you mess up you're not going
to get any power once you want to put
this watch on wall we did say that a day
and a half to about two days was going
to be possible here but a day and a half
was already pretty accurate we only had
to really charge this watch maybe every
other night but that's a marginal
increase in terms of what battery life
is for smart watches today and finally
of course there is the microphone input
one of the main ways that Android wear
is Android wear now it might feel a
little bit weird from time to time to
actually talk to your watch but if
you're already used to it you have the
main issues the same goes for pretty
much any other Android wear device where
if you're in a very loud environment it
may not be able to hear your voice so
you have to get in really close or just
use your fingers to swipe around and get
things done that way and finally in
software we have well Android wear
Android wear is a pretty cut-and-dry
experience and if you've ever
experienced it before there's not a
whole lot that's different here you have
cards that go up and down on here and
you swipe around and you get
notifications and suggestions based upon
your search history in Google now you
can swipe over to the side in order to
respond to some of your notifications or
control them in certain ways and then
you can swipe over from the watch face
in order to access the built-in
applications now companion applications
can be pretty nice but they are really
kind of far and few between compared to
the overall crux of the experience and
that is of course the fact that Android
wear is a Notification Center certain
applications do definitely shine on
Android wear in particular using maps on
it especially when you're driving but
then there are also some disadvantages
there like I've always said what you're
looking at yet another screen that you
have to touch from time to time in order
to control it and that is not really
advantageous when you're driving and
while Huawei does try to inject what it
can of its own
go system into Android wear that really
is just in the form of a lot of
different watch faces and even though it
adds a little bit more customization
ultimately Android wear is Android wear
and that is what you get the Huawei
watch is available in a number of
different colorways and even material
choices the one that I have on my wrist
right now is the base model at 349
dollars there is another version of this
that has a metal band and maybe a couple
of colors for the body that comes in 399
the most premium of them however have
gold in the body and in the band and
that can cost you up to seven hundred
and ninety nine dollars see unless
you're actually really looking for a
classic look that classic look on this
device could actually make it a little
bit boring I will admit that this tuxedo
color scheme is partially to blame if I
had my pick the black on black with a
clasping metal band would be more
exciting but not buy so much not to
mention it requires a bit more money to
get those design aspects that are much
different from the norm we give Huawei a
lot of props for really putting the
watch back into SmartWatch but it only
really manages to do that without going
truly above and beyond
it's a Mitch competition in an
increasingly round SmartWatch landscape
the Huawei watch can boast about being
the first one that pretty much got it
right but it isn't alone anymore and
that just might be its biggest problem
now the Huawei watch was really
anticipated and we were really happy to
be able to test it out and bring you
this review but we ended up thinking
that even if the lustre in the beginning
was there it may have faded away just a
little bit when we finally got to spend
some time with it it's not a horrible
watch by pert by any means but it just
doesn't offer that much more than many
of the other smart watches do already so
