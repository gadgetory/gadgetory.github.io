Authority what's going on everybody and
every photo and video you're seeing in
this camera shootout was taken on the
cameras of the HTC One m9 let's start
off with some of the better - pretty
good results that the HTC One m9 was
able to make in my travels to San
Francisco and then to the Hollywood sign
there are going to be a lot of photos
here that you're seeing in the beginning
of this video in full broad daylight now
these are obviously going to be the most
ideal situations for you to use the HTC
One m9 as well as other cameras as well
but this is definitely where you're
going to see some of the best photos
that this camera can make from there I
should tell you that I'm taking all of
these photos at the full resolution at
20 megapixels and as you can see the
coloration is quite good it might not be
quite as saturated as plenty of the
other players in the android game but
nonetheless you'll see these photos have
a very large size to them and then
you'll see the 100 crops that you're
already saying for plenty of the photos
in here as a companion out on daily
drives you'll find that the HTC One m9
is not a hard camera to use especially
when you have that interface that swipes
up and down from the different modes
however certain aspects of the camera
app are a little bit fidgety especially
when you're trying to trigger things
like the HDR mode you have to go through
a few different presses in order to even
activate it and then do the same number
of presses if you want to turn it off
for particular photos but the HDR
samples are going to come up a little
bit later in this video and I'll show
you how it sort of mitigates the
exposure issues that happens in the
camera app but at the same time the HDR
mode is maybe a little bit hit-and-miss
as well but nonetheless here we are
doing the hike on the Hollywood Hills
they've got a couple lovely dogs here to
take some photos and some videos of and
really all of these photos are quite
nice definitely usable in all different
situations especially in social media
this particular photo right here as
you'll see in the 100 crop is a little
bit blurry and the main reason why is
because I had to zoom in in order to get
this particular shot of the Griffith
Observatory and the same went for this
particular shot of the Hollywood sign
where i zoomed in using the camera app
and then you can see even more grain
because that digital zoom doesn't do the
photo many favor
of course ending this particular segment
with a lovely Tesla Model S now without
oh is and the pictures you might have to
try a few different times in order to
get your photo right because the
stabilization is not there however you
see it the most in videos you have to
keep yourself pretty steady in order to
get a nice steady and very good video
and in plenty of situations where maybe
you're going handheld while walking it's
not the most ideal situation but now
here is where I get into some of those
exposure issues that I told you about
earlier
now since the camera app in the HTC One
m9 focuses on spot metering you have to
find just the right spot in order to get
the exposure that you want in the photo
now if you go into a dark area the
entire photo starts to get pretty lights
and if you go into a light area the
whole photo starts to get a little bit
dark this is mostly true for situations
where you would want to use HDR as
you're seeing here in the comparison
among different exposures and then like
right here the actual HDR shots now the
HDR shots do tend to add a little bit
more color saturation and it does even
out the exposures in particular photos
and situations which is really great but
it's a mode that you're going to have to
fidget to get to in the first place
which might not always be the ideal now
some of the difference other modes that
are available include the panorama shot
which here shows a pretty nice view of
the urban lights at LACMA in LA and then
of course from the hike you can see here
that I did have a little bit of trouble
in one particular section so the
lighting did get a little bit weird
moving from left to right or right to
left with the panorama can be a bit of a
chore the front-facing camera tends to
be a highlight of the camera experience
because it is of the ultrapixel
iteration you now get the full ultra
pixel experience on the front facing
camera so especially for indoor
self-portraits you'll get some pretty
nice shots and then of course you have
all of the different effects that the
HTC One m9 camera app puts in like the
face fusion as you can see here the face
melding into another one and then going
right back you are able to put particle
effects on a particular photo and then
get a nice tiny little photo of it as
you can see right here and finally you
are able to put two photos together with
a number of different effects in order
to meld the two together into one
now all of those effects are certainly
very fun to use and it is a crux of the
camera experience on the HTC One m9
especially the zoe's which do return and
give you a nice way of kind of recapping
a particular day and you're going to see
one at the end of this video
unfortunately my main gripe with the HTC
One m9 camera as you're going to see as
I'm slowly getting into the indoor shot
and then later into the low-light shots
is that the camera itself in just a
chair picture quality is pretty uneven
especially when you take away prominent
light sources and you get indoors or you
get even two shots during the night you
tend to see a lot more grain and
unfortunately there's a noise reduction
that's going on here that really makes
all the photos look really smudgy and
you're going to see that digression as I
slowly get into much lower light
situations now from what I can tell the
main reason why the HTC One m9 has
trouble in low-light shots is because it
does two things in typically in these
situations it ups the ISO to very high
levels which you can already see here
adds a lot of grain to photos and then
it slows the shutter speed which has a
different problem attached to it at
slower shutter speeds you have to keep
your hands as steady as possible because
there's a longer amount of time needed
for the camera to bring in all of the
light in order to get the proper
exposure now in those situations you're
going to end up having to take multiple
shots and for the most part you're
probably going to end up getting
somewhat blurry photos because of the
slow shutter speed now what that means
is that the HTC One m9 camera just
happens to be pretty uneven it is able
to get some pretty great shots in very
prominent life but in even indoor
situations the grain just comes out in
the noise reduction that the camera app
uses in its post-processing really
doesn't do much to help the situation
and to end this video since you guys
liked it so much last time I went ahead
and put a lot of foodie pictures at the
end of this so you can see how the m9
fares in that particular situation which
is really common for a lot of your users
ultimately the HTC One m9 is not a bad
performer by any means it is a very
solid performer in the camera department
but unfortunately there's one particular
reason why I wouldn't use it all the
time and it's because I would prefer
that the camera I have on me at all
times
phone is a really good performer in
pretty much any situation that I would
throw at it now the HTC One m9 does do
some pretty great photos in broad
daylight and in high-level light shots
and even if the color saturation is a
little bit lower you can always bump
that up in the settings but once you go
to the low-light situations that's when
things really take a turn and the noise
reduction the post-production and really
just the different choices that the HTC
One m9 camera makes really don't make
for a good low light level shooter many
users have confirmed that if you go into
the settings you can tweak a number of
the toggles in order to get better
photos out of this camera but for a
out-of-the-box experience you would
really help that the phone that you
spend a lot of money on will be able to
perform the way that you need it to and
unfortunately with the HTC One m9 that's
just not the experience that I had with
it as always give it into Android

HTC One m9 including the review that you
