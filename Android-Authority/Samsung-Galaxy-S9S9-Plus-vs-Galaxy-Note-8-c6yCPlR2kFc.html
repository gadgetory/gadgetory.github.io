the most recent release before it the
differences between the two phones might
be obvious after all one has a stylus
built in but there is more to the
picture than meets the iris pun intended
what might be most exciting about this
comparison is how the Galaxy S line can
influence the future Galaxy Note it's
Joshua for Gaara what's going on
everybody and this is the Galaxy S 9
versus the Galaxy Note 8 design is
actually a bit different between this
two and not just because of the size the
Galaxy Note 8 brings the 18 by 9 aspect
ratio in a 6.3 inch screen that is a
little bit too tall for some people if
you're looking for good one-handed usage
that is why the Galaxy S line is often
welcome to because the smaller of the
two makes handily more accessible
however the galaxy s 9 plus still has a
6.2 inch screen if you want to have more
screen real estate it's also no
understatement to say that the s 9 plus
is very similar to the note 8 and that's
because of more than just the screen
after all the galaxy s 9 now brings the
same two lens setup that was first
introduced in the note 8 it now has a
telephoto lens on top of the main lens
which has a number of improvements but
one of the best parts about looking at
this camera module is that the
fingerprint reader is no longer next to
it it is now below it making it a lot
easier to reach even if you're using the
bigger model definitely a lot easier
than trying to reach the fingerprint
reader on the no-date so the cameras are
a big upgrade in the galaxy s 9 and the
s 9 plus but we're not just talking
about this secondary lens yes the
telephoto lens on either phone comes at
f/2 point 4 aperture but the main lens
is the exciting prospects built into the
mechanics as an actual opening and
shutting iris if you want to have more
light and better depth of field effects
then opening it all the way to the F 1.5
aperture brings in the bouquet
while the F 2.4 closed aperture is
better for wider frames or wider scenes
now these aperture changes occur
automatically in the auto mode of course
however if you want to change it
yourself you can always go into the pro
mode and any people out there who have
used DSLRs and our big faux togs might
really be excited by seeing a mechanical
iris on a smartphone for the first time
the note II kind of strikes the middle
ground here with a single F 1.7 aperture
that is in the mainland's on top of the
telephoto lens that we've talked about
already Samsung is also adding
multi-frame processing to their cameras
in the galaxy s 9 line the DRM on the
actual camera module itself will take
dozens of photo
and use all of them in order to create
the best final shot and that doesn't
even take into consideration new modes
that we have talked about in a camera
future-focused video you can also see on
this channel super slow-motion is really
fun 960 frames per second at 720p
resolution is always going to be a fun
prospect but trying to get that perfect
shot might be a bit tough that's why the
auto mode figures out when the motion
happens so then it captures the motion
in that super slow-mo AR emoji is for
all of those out there who might have an
emoji envy or you might just want to
take bitmoji x' to the next level you
can create an avatar with a lot of
different customization options and then
use the front-facing camera to actually
move it around and make it make faces
based upon what you are actually doing
so those camera modes and those
enhancements are basically exclusive to
the galaxy s 9 family at least for now
the no 8 will then step a little bit
behind the pack but it is incredibly
important to remember that the node 8 is
more of a Productivity phone as well
that's because of the s-pen so many
capabilities are baked into the stylus
and its software and the note 8 is an
incredibly capable machine use the s-pen
as a sort of Mouse for precision or
easier item selection for writing notes
via various different methods or even
use it to just draw all over the place
and then of course there's a big speed
the Bigsby button is over on the side
and still provides the same level of
assistance but it has been somewhat
enhanced in the galaxy s 9 it is able to
recognize foods and it is also able to
do better live translation when you're
using the augmented reality portion of
the camera now these are features that
we expect to come to the other Galaxy
phones that have Bigsby so it's only a
matter of time before software update
kind of bridges the gap here so we've
talked about camera and then also the
productivity of the note 8 in particular
but we can come back to the media
consumption experience the screens are
incredible but you also have the ability
to have great audio now on the galaxy s
9 and s 9 plus powered by Dolby Atmos
there are two speakers now one on the
bottom and one on the front that is
integrated into the call speaker and
together they provide much louder sound
than any other Samsung device before the
rest of the phone is what you would
probably expect the performance gets an
upgrade to the snapdragon 845 and the s9
plus closes the ram gap by bringing six
gigabytes of RAM much like the note 8
one interesting tidbit here is that the
Galaxy Note 8 is the middle child in
terms of battery
five sporting 330 million powers
compared to 3,000 and 3,500 for the
galaxy s 9 and s 9 plus respectively it
should come as no surprise that the
Galaxy Note 8 is still a very viable
choice what is exciting is that the
Galaxy S 9 is bringing a couple of new
features here like dual speakers and the
mechanical iris that could very well
make it to the next note device the
galaxy s 9 is available for pre-order
starting March 2nd and users around the
world can trade in their phones to get a
deep discount on the new phone
especially if you have a note 8 and you
decide to trade it in
you'll get that deep discount and the S
9 hour or the s 9 plus will be more
affordable for you now keep it tuned to
