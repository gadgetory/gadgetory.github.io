here from computex 2012 start steal a
cuvette here with android authority what
we're looking at here is a 7 inch tablet
made by a company called myung really
really smooth operation it's only a
single core arm a8 processor running at
one point two gigahertz but as you can
see the operation is extremely fluid
now it's not the thinnest tablet in the
world but it's packing a 3500 milliamp
battery android sort of is at a
crossroads here you have devices you
know like some of the more recent
tablets that are selling for five
hundred dollars and a little bit lower
maybe the Samsung Galaxy 2 tab 10.1
around 399 more aggressive price points
but these chapters coming out of Taiwan
and China are totally going to change
the game and further democratize access
to technology this tablet is going to be
selling for around one hundred twenty
dollars already has android 4.0 ice
cream sandwich on board really fluid
operation as you can see nice large
battery and tons of connectivity in it
too we have hdmi pretty much everything
else you go on sim card micro USB and it
even yet you can even throw in a sim
card now they've told us that they are
winning FCC approval they do expect it
to be about a month away but I mean
really what more can you ask for it has
an IPS LCD display some really great
viewing angles it is only a 1024 x 600
resolution display but we're looking at
basically a hundred hundred twenty
dollar tablet now they're not going to
be rounding it under their own name
they're looking for partners right now
but it just just stands to serve as
testament to the power of android and
the fact that we can have a really high
quality experience tablet commuting
experience for a really aggressive price
point which is going to be great for all
those people you know who don't maybe
have 500 always kicking around and
really that's why i under its going to
win the war anyway guys it starts to
lock away from android authority here
we're here at the mining booth this is
the m15 like i say 100 to 150 doll or
tablet really good build materials
really high quality stuff large battery
tons of connectivity yeah thanks for
checking in guys lots more to come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
