the Samsung Galaxy s7 so that'll make
anyone ask what makes these galaxy s7
active different while share was a
different story
just because the s6 didn't get it while
the s6 active did for this year's new
smartphone and the active line it's
going to need a little bit more to stand
out
hey guys John Vee here with andrew
authority and this is a quick look
between the Samsung Galaxy s7 active and
the standard galaxy s7 its bones versus
beauty in this comparison even though
the spec sheets indicate otherwise the
galaxy s7 is simply the more appealing
looking at the two you have that premium
design with its glass meets metal
package and it just looks more peeling
no matter how you look at it then again
the beefier size of the s7 active gives
it more of that protective quality that
you won't find in many phones it's meant
to withstand abuse that the standard
galaxy s7 can endure so that means that
the SM active can survive drops from a
height of 5 feet onto the hard pavement
like we said water resistance is back
with the s7 so that's the longer unique
attribute for the s7 active however it's
protected from other environmental
conditions such as extreme temperatures
dust low pressure and high pressure on
paper the two phones share a 5.1 inch
quad HD Super AMOLED display there's not
a whole lot different from what we can
see so far so you could expect true to
life colors wide viewing angles and
strong brightness outputs between them
still the only thing we can tell you is
that the s7 active is fashioned with a
shatter resistant screen now that
naturally helps in safeguarding display
in the vent it's accidentally or
purposefully dropped just like last year
the SM inactive is blessed with a
chunkier battery in this case a four
thousand milliamp power one which
obviously attributes to it's thicker
chassis so that way you can expect it to
offer a longer battery life in the
process you also get Wireless and rapid
charging with the two phones the
fingerprint sensor isn't new for the s7
but it is for the s7
active in fact it's the first time we're
seeing it in the series instead of being
flanked by capacitive buttons like the
s7 the s7 active relies on these really
huge physical buttons instead now being
released mid-year you're not going to
find anything new with the computing
power of the galaxy s7 active in fact
it's the same chipset here a quad-core
Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chip coupled
with four gigabytes of RAM and Adreno
530 GPU its operational performance is
very much like the s7 so that's good
news
mainly because we've been using the s7
since its release and even now after
months of use it's still running pretty
fine another example of how closely
related they are is by looking at their
cameras what we have on both is a 12
megapixel sensor with an epic 1.7
aperture lens you have also phase
detection autofocus oh is and and LED
flash the front-facing cameras are
identical as well so that's a five
megapixel one on both now first we
thought that the s7 active was unique
because it offered manual video controls
when using the pro mode Oh soon realized
that the s7 s camera app has also been
updated to offer this feature as well
you're going to find good old TouchWiz
running on top of android 6.0.1
marshmallow with both bones now the
single difference is seen in the
activity zone that's made available to
the galaxy s7 active when its physical
active key is press it's a portal that
presents us with some useful information
and quick access to some stuff like the
flashlight for example but you can still
obtain pretty much the same things on
the s7 by just looking around software
pricing is always a finicky thing for a
phone that's a variant of another that's
the situation where the s7 active finds
itself on paper for the extra $100
she'll be dishing out to buy the active
over the standard s7 you're getting a
smartphone that has a rugged design and
a beefier battery and that's pretty much
it at roughly $700 outright the galaxy
s7 isn't cheap at all
so the $800 cost of the s7 active might
cause some folks to really consider
their actions ultimately though it'll
come down to whether or not
the extra protection that the s7 active
offers and that's about it between these
two phones so if you guys wanna learn
