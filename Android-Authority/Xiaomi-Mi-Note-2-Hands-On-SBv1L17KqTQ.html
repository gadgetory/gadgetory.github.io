what's going on everybody and here we're
taking a look at these Yami me Note 2
now this is the new flagship by Zhao me
but of course we also have a look at the
concept phone the me mix available here
at Android authority calm but until you
get to that video we're gonna take a
look at this one that has has xiaomi
calls it 3d glass on the back and also
on the front now I know what you're
thinking this does make it look a little
bit like a Samsung Galaxy Note 7 however
it does feel that slightly bit different
it does feel a little bit wider and also
the metal that that the two screens come
to meet on the sides is a little bit
sharper overall it's still a nice
feeling phone in the hand and that 5.7
inch AMOLED screen unfortunately comes
in at 1080p resolution however there's a
lot that this phone can boast a bunch of
features that it has from what might
seem like features that were found in
other smart phones all put together into
one hopefully wonderful package and that
starts off with the Snapdragon 820 1 now
there are two different versions of this
device including a global version of the
more premium edition and the premium
edition comes with 6 gigabytes of RAM
and 128 gigabytes of on-board storage
the other version comes with 4 gigabytes
of RAM and 64 gigabytes of storage but
the global version will have LTE band
support that is very wide reaching
you'll be able to use this phone in so
many different places so roaming will
never be an issue if you're using this
phone across borders from China and even
in the West throw all of that together
with a battery that could last for a
very long time especially when you
consider that full HD display it is a
four thousand 70 milliamp hour battery
that can be charged up to eighty three
percent and only thirty minutes so
that's quite impressive and that means
that power should never be really
missing from the experience the daily
experience of using this phone as we
move to the cameras I do have to say we
don't have any shots or videos to show
you right now but it does seem like a
very powerful package with an IMX sensor
that comes in at 22.5 6 megapixels not
23 they want it to be quite accurate
with the way that they say this camera
but it also comes with a powerful AIS
gyroscope based
stabilization that Johnny made a big
deal of showing in their presentation
the front camera is also very powerful
coming in at 8 megapixels @f 2.0
aperture but of course the backbone of
this device is the me UI and we didn't
really have a whole lot of time to dive
into any new feature since the last time
we saw the operating system but it still
feels incredibly familiar me UI without
its app drawer is one of the more
popular Chinese operating systems
available out in Asia and of course you
can get localized versions of it and the
global version will be able to be used
across all different platforms and
carriers across the world and with that
LTE support this could be one of those
phones that is just super easy to use no
matter where you are all of that makes
for a device that when put together
might sound like it has a very hefty
price point and actually it does not
John me is putting this phone at around
the four hundred and ninety nine dollar
price point and we converted to that
price from the rmb pricing that they
announced at the event and it was an
exciting portion indeed ultimately this
phone is looking to be everything to
everyone and whether or not it's going
to live up to all those promises and
each and every feature is something
we're going to leave off into our full
review so keep it tuned to Android
authority for more about the me note -
and even more about Johnny in general
especially here at their event in
Beijing China where we got to play with
this and of course the concept phone the
me mix which is also available here keep
it tuned here because of course we are
