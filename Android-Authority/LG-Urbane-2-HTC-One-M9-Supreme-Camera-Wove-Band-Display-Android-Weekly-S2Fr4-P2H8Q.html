domain.com now imagine what will happen
when we no longer have to look at the
World Wide Web through these tiny little
screens and wove is beginning to show us
the light the SmartWatch ecosystem is
growing fast but not all wearables need
to adhere to the watch form factor in
order to be successful enter both the
product of the decade old flexible
electronics specialist poly era unlike
devices like the Samsung gear fit or LG
G flex smartphones which feature curved
displays fixed in place by non flexible
glass the wove band is actually flexible
itself and can be bent over and over
without damage thanks to a technology
called digital fabric that's why Paul II
era Bills wove as the world's first
truly flexible display product low
features an e-ink flexible display of 10
40 by 200 resolution with its surface
totalling about five times the surface
of a typical SmartWatch display the
device is powered by a one gigahertz
freescale cortex a7 processor 512
megabytes of RAM four gigabytes of
internal storage and 230 milliamp hour
battery because it employs electronic
ink similar to pebble products which
only consume power during animations you
can expect excellent battery life now I
know what some of you are thinking
you're thinking Jace come on that's all
great but that's still a relatively
small display but think about the
possibilities when anything can become a
display when you're not worried about
being precious and delicate with your
device anything can be sent information
to display information for you a wall a
window your table heck your refrigerator
door can become a display then we're not
bound to these blocky devices to view
the world wide web could be amazing
think about it no HTC was really busy
this week so let's start with the HTC
One m9 plus supreme camera the new
version is officially called the one m9
plus supreme camera yes really trading
out the 20 megapixel sensor for the m9
plus for a 21 megapixel camera with OAS
and laser autofocus while the m9 plus
had duo camera lenses this time the m9 +
supreme camera offers the laser
autofocus system in the second rear
cameras place outside of the upgraded
camera the new m9 + variant is pretty
much the same phone as before that means
you get a 5.2 inch qHD display and a
mediatek mt6752 end processor with 3
gigabytes of RAM other specs include 32
gigabytes of internal storage
front-facing speakers a fingerprint
scanner and a twenty 840 million power
battery at least for now the m9 +
supreme camera is only slated to arrive
in Taiwan starting October 6 with a
price point of about 630 dollars
considering the modest improvements we
sincerely doubt the phone will ever
officially make its way outside of Asia
now let's talk the HTC butterfly 3 the
handset boasts some cutting edge
specifications that arguably make it
more of a flagship than this year's one
m9 the hardware remains the same as
before offering a 5.2 inch display with
qHD that's 2560 by 1440 gigabytes of RAM
a 32 gigabytes of internal storage with
micro SD card support if you need more
there is also a 27 hundred million power
battery dual front-facing boomsound
speakers quick charge 2.0 support an IP
X 5 and X 7 certifications for water and
dust resistance now one of the more
interesting features of the butterfly 3
is the dual rear camera setup which
offers a 20 megapixel sensor that is
able to capture additional depth
information much like the HTC One m8 the
rear camera also features optical image
stabilization and a dual LED flash on
the front there's a 13 megapixel camera
for some high resolution selfies the HTC
butterfly 3 is scheduled to arrive in
Taiwan on October 20th with a retail
price of around 600 bucks now let's talk
about what Krystal learned which you got
our hands on the LG urbane 2 SmartWatch
the new LG watch urbane sports a similar
design to the original albeit with a
more refined look at this time around
cosmetics aside the biggest difference
is under the hood as the urbane 2 is the
first Android wear device to feature
cellular connectivity that means you not
only can connect via bluetooth or Wi-Fi
but also with 3G or 4G giving you
greater and
pendants from your smartphone the urbane
two utilizes a nano-sim and is not
carrier locked giving you the freedom to
use it with whatever network you choose
that means you can now leave your phone
at home and still have access to your
emails messages and all your other
important data the watch urbane 2 packs
the best specs of any Android wear
SmartWatch to date this includes a 1.2
gigahertz Snapdragon 400
system-on-a-chip 768 megabytes of RAM 4
gigabytes of internal storage Bluetooth
4.1 Wi-Fi and GPS the display is 1.3
eight inches with a 480 by 480 pixel
resolution for an excellent 348 pixels
per inch for comparison the next best
display is the Huawei watch at 400 by
400 pixels now the watch is thick
compared to other smartwatches but
crystal claims it doesn't feel big on
her hand even though from this photo it
looks big now a couple of you were
