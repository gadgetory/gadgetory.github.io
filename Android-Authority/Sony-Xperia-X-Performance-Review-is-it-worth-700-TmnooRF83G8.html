performance is the highest end model and
is ultimately the biggest flagship that
sony has so far for the year 2016 the
design isn't really too surprising at
all it looks very similar to Sony phones
we've seen in years past and almost
identical to the more mid-range Xperia X
with the only difference being the
brushed metal aluminum backing otherwise
it's a rectangular slab with glass on
the front and tapered edges along the
corners and sides that make it pretty
comfortable to hold and because it has a
much smaller 5-inch display compared to
most other flagships with larger screens
it's really easy to operate in one hand
the overall bill does feel very solid
and sturdy but it isn't without its
quirks the brushed metal backing is a
nice touch but similar to the LG g5 it
doesn't feel like metal and it feels
hollow as if the internals aren't quite
filling up all the space inside here
have a listen and you'll see what I mean
my other gripe with this phone are the
physical hardware buttons and this is an
area that sounds minor but can really
make all the difference in a phone's
build quality both the volume keys and
physical camera shutter button are not
clicky and tactile at all and the mushy
feedback makes them feel extremely cheap
the placement of the volume rockers are
also not exactly ideal they're in a very
awkward spot right below the power
button making them uncomfortable to
press with your thumb and simple things
like taking a screenshot feel a lot more
difficult the position of the volume
keys is most likely where it is for the
purposes of controlling digital zoom
with the camera but I don't think
digital zoom is enough justification to
be in such an under Kannamma cloak ation
everything else is fine though the power
button is nice and large and easy to
press and then you have your usual
headphone jack up top micro USB port on
the bottom and the SIM card / micro SD
card tray on the left side in typical
Sony fashion the X performance is ip68
dust and water resistance so you can
dunk it in water use it in the rain and
it'll be perfectly fine one feature that
it does not have though is a fingerprint
sensor and if this phone came out a
couple of years ago where fingerprint
sensors weren't as prevalent that
probably would have been okay but this
is 2016 and fingerprint sensors have
pretty much become a standard on
high-end flagship smartphones and we're
even seeing budget phones that cost a
fraction of what the X performance cost
that include fingerprint sensors so it's
a little bit of a head-scratcher why
Sony chose not to include one another
oddity with the X performance is the
placement of the NFC chip so most phones
typically have their NFC chips on the
back but the X performance has its NFC
chip on the front in the upper left
corner and the biggest problem with this
location is that it makes things like
touching your phone to transfer content
to somebody else's phone connecting to a
Bluetooth speaker or using mobile
payments a little bit more awkward and
cumbersome because you can't see the
display and this is just another one of
those quirks that really makes you
question why Sony chose to do the things
that they did with this phone so
normally you have to go like this but
with the X performance you have to go
like this and
this is typically where you have to tap
the display to finish the beam I don't
think that's going to fly over too well
with most people most high-end flagship
smartphones these days are packing quad
HD displays but with the X performance
Sony chose to stick with 1080p and on a
five-inch screen 1080p is perfectly fine
it's extremely sharp colors are vibrant
it gets plenty bright that is easily
visible in direct sunlight and the
viewing angles are also quite good just
like previous Sony devices you have the
option to tweak the white balance and
vibrancy of the display to whatever
looks best to your eyes so there's
nothing inherently wrong with the
display at all it's a very good-looking
screen but this is a $700 smartphone and
pretty much every phone in this price
range if not all are coming with quad HD
display so the point where it's
basically become a standard in
high-priced flagships so it doesn't make
a whole lot of sense by Sony chose to go
with 1080p and it's especially puzzling
considering this is the same company
that released a 4k smart phone last year
let that soak in for a minute on the
more positive side despite certain
features being omitted or the
questionable hardware decisions there
are some things to like about this phone
first off it has dual front-facing
speakers which are always awesome to
have on any smart phone they're not the
loudest front-facing speakers I've ever
heard and could be a notch or two higher
in volume but overall they produce a
nice clean sound without any Distortion
and they've been a pleasure to use while
gaming or watching YouTube secondly Sony
did pack the X performance with flagship
specs you've got these snapdragon 820
processor 3 gigabytes of RAM 32 gigs of
internal storage and the micro SD card
slot that I mentioned earlier for
support up to 200 gigabytes of
additional storage despite having a gig
less of RAM than most other flagships I
haven't noticed any real-world
differences between the X performance
and other flagships on the market that
are rocking the same chipset it's fast
and fluid touch responsiveness has been
great and it plays games and jumps
between multiple applications with very
little problems it's safe to say that
performance is not an issue here and it
definitely lives up to that part of its
name battery life on the X performance
is good but is it anything crazy
spectacular it's got a twenty seven
hundred milli amp hour battery which
falls short of that magical 3000
milliamp hour mark but it's
enough to last me a full day as long as
I keep that usage to mostly basic tasks
like reading emails texting web browsing
social media and maybe an hour or two of
watching YouTube anything heavier than
that like long gaming sessions coupled
with a heavy camera usage and I often
found myself how to recharge at least
once in the middle of the day it does
have quick charge for faster charging
speeds but despite having a Snapdragon
820 it's utilizing the much older quick
charge 2.0 if you're really hurting for
battery and can't get to a charger Sony
stamina and ultra stamina modes can
effectively stretch your remaining
battery life by limiting your phone's
functionality on paper the xperia x
performance is packing some impressive
sounding cameras the front camera is a
13 megapixel shooter that packs plenty
of detail and resolution it's more than
you really need for video chats and
works extremely well if you'd like
taking selfies on the rear is a 23
megapixel camera with single LED flash
but despite having such a high megapixel
count the X performance doesn't do 4k
video recording another feature that
most flag ships have that the X
performance lacks and instead tops out
at 1080p at 60 frames it does however
come with a continuous tracking
autofocus feature that Sony called
predictive hybrid autofocus which lets
you tap on the screen to lock onto a
subject and it works pretty well
provided the subject isn't moving too
fast the camera interface is fairly easy
to navigate swiping on the display will
cycle between superior Auto manual video
and the usual slew of fun slash gimmicky
Sony camera features that we've all seen
before like inserting your face into a
picture or the various AR FX that can
make dinosaurs crawl all over your
living room or laser beams shoot from
your eyes having manual controls in the
camera app is always a nice feature to
have
but Sony's manual mode only gives you
the option to tweak white balance and
exposure whereas other smartphone
cameras on the market give you a whole
lot more HDR is also only accessible in
these settings when shooting in manual
which seems counterintuitive and doesn't
make a whole lot of sense since the
majority of photos that people take on
their smartphones are usually in Auto
picture quality on the X performance is
generally pretty good in bright lighting
conditions pictures are very well
detailed vibrant and colorful but it
does tend to make bright colors like
pinks and purples look
unnatural it also has a problem with
over crushing shadows so dynamic range
definitely could be better but HDR can
drastically reduce the shadows and bring
back a lot of that missing detail
low-light performance isn't terrible and
certainly far from the worst but it
isn't anything to really write home
about the camera still produces some
perfectly usable photos but you can
easily see these soft details and noise
starting to creep in as the lights get
dim software-wise you looking at android
6.0 marshmallow but Sony's Xperia Y and
software is definitely one area that
Sony has always been pretty good with it
clearly isn't stock Android but it does
maintain a somewhat stock look and feel
and Sony's UI has been updated with a
much flatter look which blends in a lot
better with Google's material design the
X performance comes with the usual Sony
apps like life log and PlayStation
integration for remotely playing your
PlayStation games on your phone but
aside from that it isn't overly bloated
with a bunch of apps that you'll never
use Sony also doesn't bog down the
experience with a ton of features either
but there are some pretty useful ones
such as double tap to wake custom icon
packs and a built in theme engine to
customize the look and feel of the
interface although there's only a
handful of themes to pick from the only
software tweak that didn't find
particularly useful is the suggested and
recommended apps pane which you can
access by swiping down on any home
screen or through the app drawer but
thankfully this is a feature that can be
disabled so there's no question that the
X performance is a good phone despite
some of its quirks and odd hardware
decisions by Sony but that's not the
problem here
as I mentioned a couple times already
this phone cost $700 putting it in
direct competition with the s7 HTC 10
and the LG g5 and the phone's price is
the biggest thing working against it if
it's going to cost $700 it needs to be
able to do all the same core things that
those phones do like have a fingerprint
sensor a quad HD display and 4k video
recording then on the other end of the
spectrum you have phones like the one
plus three that have a fingerprint
sensor and double the RAM of the X
performance while only costing a
fraction of the price even if it's phone
were to cost four to five hundred
dollars I'm still not entirely sure it'd
be that great of a deal but for the
things that it lacks it definitely isn't
worth 700 bucks if you buy this phone
you will enjoy it but knowing that there
are better deals out there that either
cost the same price or a fraction of the
price the X performance is an investment
that isn't going to give you the return
that you deserve as always thank you
