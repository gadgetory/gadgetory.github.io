Authority what's going on everybody and
here we are again with the LG g5 now I
wanted to give you guys a closer look
into how the modules actually work on
the g5 and removing this little bottom
panel right here where the battery will
actually come out and I'll do that in a
second but as a quick disclaimer I will
tell you that if you'd looked at our LG
g5 first look and also the camera future
focus that will tell you everything you
need to know about the camera and also
about how the modules kind of work what
we're going to use right now is just an
example of what it's like to actually
remove everything and to be able to
change the functionality of this device
as you're pressing this little area you
feel that there's a slight movement in
the bottom panel that kind of comes out
a little bit and after that by holding
down on that area you are actually able
to just remove the entire area now it is
very much recommended that you turn off
the device first as we had right here
and be able to just pop out the battery
like this now this is the entire battery
right here the 28 28 hundred rather
milliamp hour battery that is here and
it comes with this nice little
inscription on the bottom that says
life's good when you play more and
that's exactly what we're going to be
doing with the LG g5 by adding in a new
peripheral now one thing that you have
to know about we're moving the battery
on here is that you kind of have to come
at an angle on this so by gripping on
the side like this and removing the
battery you just be able to snap it off
like that and you can already see right
here that the proprietary connector on
here is what will snap into other
peripherals that are used with the LG g5
in this case we are going to be using
the one that probably is very important
to a lot of shooters out there the
actual camera module now the camera
module is going to add hardware buttons
in order to take advantage of the camera
and by doing so we're just going to put
the battery in at a certain angle like
this and just well that snap it into
place it does take a little bit of
getting used to but after a while it's
not all that hard to do and it's going
to become second nature and once you
have the battery inside of the new
module you'll just take out the g5 and
light it right in and once you feel the
snap and it does not come out by pulling
it unless you press this little area on
the side you should be good to go now
coming in just a little bit closer to
the module itself we're going to show
you what it looks like when I turn this
over now we have the camera module right
here which adds a full area right here
in order for you to grip now that will
allow everything to be easy rather this
way that would be easier to use for
taking shots because we also have the
shutter button right here a button for
triggering video recording a dial in
order to change the zoom and then a
small little area right here where
you're just going to flick this toggle
in order to trigger the camera but of
course when you remove the battery and
you put in a new module the battery is
being reinserted so we do have to turn
the device on now for actually using the
module here this is the one that you're
going to use that actually makes the
phone not all that well let's say
pocketable
because you have this large area right
here that houses a 1200 milliamp hour
battery which will bolster the already
include 2800 so you will get more
battery life out of this particular grip
so it's nice to be able to have that
function but having the grip right here
allows it to feel even more secure when
you're actually taking photos with it
turn on the brightness and this little
toggle on the side right here is what
we're going to use to trigger the camera
so just by flicking that area right
there we'll be able to get right into
the camera now shooting with this
particular module is a lot easier
because you have the hardware buttons
already up on the sides and resting your
finger on this area right here will make
things very easy while you press the
shutter button with your index finger
much like a point-and-shoot camera so
it's pretty obvious already that the
grip makes shooting with this camera
even easier and as we showed in our
camera future focus things are actually
quite nice with the wide-angle 135
degree angle view that is available
accompanying the regular more narrow
field of view in the original lens now
pressing the shutter button halfway down
will get you a focus just like a regular
camera and then you press all the way
down
in order to take the picture you can
also trigger video recording using the
other button and there we are doing a
video so everything is just nice and
easy to use we're just one hand right
there now as you can see we already have
the pinch to zoom in order to change
from the two different lenses and be
able to zoom in as needed but this dial
that is right here on the corner will
allow for the same functionality so if
you are holding the phone in one hand on
the grip you'll be able to just roll the
dial in order to do the zoom this is
just one example and probably the best
one that's available right now as to
what the module is able to do the
modular design rather is able to do by
adding even more functions to the LG g5
and so there you have it for a quick
look at the modular design of the LG g5
we have the camera module on here right
now and as you saw in this video it's
actually not all that hard to get the
battery out of the original g5
construction and be able to change the
battery into whatever the new modules
may be now if you saw our first look
already you know that we were taking a
look at the camera module and then we
also have a bang and Austin created hi-5
DAC module that was able to pre create
hi-fi audio at 32 bit for even better
audio listening so those are just the
two examples that we had currently for
these modules and we are really excited
to see what other ones will be made
available LG did make it clear that the
design and the construction of this
modular design will be made available to
third-party manufacturers so they will
be able to create even more experiences
and even actually create third-party
batteries so you can bolster the
replaceable battery experience on the LG
g5 so keep it tuned to Android authority
for all of the best including the LG g5
if you haven't already taken a look at
our first look and the verses that we
have and the future focus videos that we
have on this particular device you can
go and head on over to Android or decom

to this channel if you haven't already
to keep up with the LG g5 because we are
