handy the Android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly
let's jump right into those headlines
it's been found that Google photos will
keep uploading your photos to Google
even if you've uninstalled the
application this is because it's
integrated with Google settings that's
on every Android phone so if you want to
disable it forever you'll actually have
to do so using the Google Settings app
and that is just a little bit weird
according to reports Facebook is working
on a virtual assistant called Moneypenny
ostensively named after the James Bond
character unlike most Moneypenny is a
virtual assistant to help you shop for
things and it'll be integrated into
Facebook messenger of course will
provide more details as we get them late
last week developer bean dog announced
that they'll be releasing a standalone
expansion to baldur's gate called
Baldur's Gate siege of dragon's beer the
game which is coming out later this year
will tell the tale of what happens
between Baldur's Gate 1 and to Twitter
and the third-party developers that have
been making Twitter apps have been at
odds for a long time thanks to Twitter's
ridiculous token limit that prevents
Twitter applications from becoming super
popular in a recent announcement Twitter
has conceded that they may need to make
some changes and we hope that leads to
more third-party Twitter apps after an
absence due to some pranking the google
map maker is reopening its doors
sometime in August the improved version
will have a stricter approval process
and more moderation to prevent things
like that prank where someone added an
Android urinating on an Apple logo for
even more Android apps and games news
updates and new releases don't forget to
check out this week's newsletter which
is linked in the video description below
there we have a complete list of all the
happenings in the app world including
the stuff we didn't have time for here
today if you're so inclined you can
subscribe with your email and get this
info beam to your inbox every single
Friday ok folks let's take a look at the
apps and games that made a big splash
this week mountain goat Mountain is a
new game out of Zynga it features some
colorful and enjoyable graphics along
with arcade style gameplay the premises
you must climb mountains while avoiding
obstacles the mechanics are simple
tapping and swiping so anyone can get
into it it is a freemium title which
means there are in app purchases but
overall it's a fun little time waster
and something a little bit different out
of Zynga Wi-Fi mapper is a new
application that helps you find Wi-Fi
hotspots the idea is that you open the
application and it shows you a map where
you can get access to free Wi-Fi
according to developers the app shows
over 600 and
50 million hot spots that you can access
the information is crowd-sourced so you
can add more if you find them and it
also comes with Foursquare integration
you can see the history of the hot spots
you've connected to and how well they've
worked it's a solid application with
some decent features and it's totally
free
redbull alert is a new alarm clock
application that aims to get you up and
out of bed before hitting the snooze
button it does this by integrating a
social aspect where you can compete with
your friends to see who wakes up the
fastest the application will also track
your progress or lack thereof
so you can see if the application
actually does help you wake up faster
it's a fun premise and it's free to use
here maps is already a popular offline
navigation option but this week milk
you've released a public beta it's a bit
convoluted as you have to join the beta
group become a beta tester and then
finally download the application the
public beta will have new features a new
UI design and will be the place where
Nokia tests all of their new ideas do
beware because that means there are
gonna be bugs too you can click the link
in the video description below to find
out how to get it last up this week is a
new first-person shooter called traitor
Valkyrie plan this is a first-person
shooter game based on a true story from
world war ii and features decent
graphics plenty of shooting and you'll
also need a little bit of stealth the
mechanics are fairly simple and the game
manages to miss a lot of the pitfalls of
other touchscreen shooters by sticking
to a simpler mechanic of course this
means it isn't as exciting as some
shooters sometimes another case is cheap
and it's fun once again I'm Joe Indy the
