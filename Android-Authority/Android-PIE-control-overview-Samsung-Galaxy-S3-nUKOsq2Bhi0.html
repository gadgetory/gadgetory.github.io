Clayton young bird coming at you from
Android authority your number one source
for all things Android and today I'm
just taking you on a quick review of
what the development community is
calling the PI control and what the PI
control is basically is a navigation bar
that overlays your Android operating
system it allows you to navigate
effortlessly and might add in style so
let's go ahead and check it out okay
guys so before we get too far in this
video let's go ahead and check out what
this pi control actually is as you can
see right here this is the bottom half
of my home screen on my Samsung Galaxy
s3 we have our capacitive buttons here
such as back menu and of course our
physical home button and on our physical
home button we can bring up our recent
apps everything of that sort but what
we're going to actually do is put our
finger on the very bottom of the screen
swipe up and we have our PI control now
the PI control is an on-screen
navigation bar of sorts it's actually
what it is
but you can customize it as it is now
you can see that we have our time our
date we've got our battery percentage
and our back home recent and search Keys
now each of these interacts differently
if we actually put our finger on it and
of course it'll perform the task that it
denotes so let's go ahead and click our
recent apps and it brings those up
pretty cool stuff huh so the next thing
I'm going to say is that you have to be
running a custom ROM to access the PI
control either that or you need to
install it with a third-party launcher
but custom roms have been implementing
the PI control namely paranoid android
who created it and they actually built
it on the CyanogenMod 10.1 source code
so it is a cm10 sort of thing this is a
cm10 bass-drum as well as a okp and
that's why it features it so anyways
guys on this particular ROM which is the
vanilla brew box I'll provide a link in
the description we're gonna want to go
ahead and open up our settings menu and
from our settings menu we're gonna want
to go down to the actual root box
settings now this will be different on
devices running paranoid android even
mind you anyways we're going to want to
go into our pie controls here
where you can see that we have all sorts
of different settings for the pie
control itself as well as the ability to
disable it I of course have it enabled
for you guys and we're going to go ahead
and check out some of the options now as
you can see the pie control has color
settings here we can go ahead and choose
holo colors which is basically a fall
color I'm not gonna change anything up
just because it's not too important to
me anyways we have our enabler right
here where we can enable or disable the
pie control here's our trigger size
modification as you can see I was
running the big trigger let's check out
the huge trigger and it looks like this
they're simply larger so next we've got
our pie gravity basically allows you to
choose where the pie control comes in
from we've got our bottom comes in from
the bottom obviously we have it on the
right as well top and left so from the
right of course we could bring it in and
we've got our pie control we've got our
pie size and right now it's at the
default size I'm gonna go ahead and
knock that up to the large size so as
you can see now it's much larger
including the entire circle that the pie
comes in on looks really awesome too
next is the pie style we've got the bear
style the quick default is slow now
that's actually the animation style so
as you can see it's slowly animating now
as opposed to the quick animation that
we had earlier then we've got our gap in
between elements we can set and we can
enable Chevron targets which will allow
the notification panel and quick
settings to be activated when swiped
anyways we have we can always show the
menu button as well and then we have our
last app button so let's go ahead and
check out what the last app was this is
our last step button so we'll click that
so anyways guys this was the pie control
really awesome a lot of cool
customizations you can do as well as
some nice interface so you can impress
your friends with and I just basically
love it if you guys want to check this
out you've got a samsung galaxy s3 go
ahead and install the Paranoid Android
ROM or install even ill a root box ROM
or you can check out the LMT launcher
which I'll provide links to in the
description for any phone you want
through the mad guys this is Clayton
Youngberg with Android authorities calm
and stay tuned for more awesome android
