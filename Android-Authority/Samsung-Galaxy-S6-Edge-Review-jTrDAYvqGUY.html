Android Authority and for many years
Samsung was highly criticized for their
build quality and heavy use of plastic
and each and every year we eagerly
waited and hoped that that would all
change well with the Galaxy s6 edge that
change is now but it didn't just happen
overnight over the last several months
there was an evolution it all started
with the Galaxy alpha one of Samsung's
first Android smartphones to feature the
use of metal but it was only along the
frame a few months later came the Galaxy
Note 4 and Note edge which were
essentially blown-up Galaxy alphas with
beefier specs and an S Pen more recently
Samsung released their a series which
were a bunch of low to mid range phones
but they were the first crop of
smartphones from Samsung to not feature
a sliver of plastic and that leads us to
today this is the Samsung Galaxy s6 edge
the evolution is complete and it may
have taken longer than we anticipated
but you note they say some of the best
things in life are worth waiting for
while Samsung may have taken some
inspiration from existing products
there's no denying that the s6 edge is
Samsung's most beautiful phone yet
Samsung has finally given us a phone
that is fitting of the flagship title
and the high price tag that comes with
it the s6 edge features a metal frame
with chamfered edges that sandwich
between two pieces of Gorilla Glass 4
and in the hand it feels solid the front
and back glass features a translucent
effect that gives the phone a very
unique look and when the light hits it
just right it can be very eye-catching
although this is a new direction for
Samsung there are still many design cues
that tell you this is a Samsung device
through and through the power button is
in its typical location on the right
with the volume buttons on the opposing
side both of which are very meaty and
tactile the home button flanked by
capacitive recent apps and back button
can be found along the front along with
the usual sensors front-facing camera
and a very bright notification LED light
above the display the IR blaster and
nano SIM slot can be found up top and
the usual 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
and single speaker have been shifted to
the bottom with the micro
usb-port sitting squarely in between the
heart rate monitor also makes a return
on the rear next to the camera speaking
of the camera it does protrude quite a
bit from the body of the phone but this
isn't anything new we've seen plenty of
other phones out there with protruding
camera lenses and they've seemed to hold
up just fine and so far the s6 edge
seems to be doing the same the big
elephant in the room with this year's
design is the lack of expandable storage
a removable battery and IP certification
which means it's no longer dust and
water resistant like it was on the s5
and some may view this as a step
backwards some may not even care and to
be honest some may not even really
notice and Samsung has typically always
been about function over form and some
may argue that they've leaned really
heavily on the function side of things
over the last several years especially
with all the hardware and software
features that they piled onto the
devices like the heart rate monitor air
gestures and whatever else you can think
of and this year they decided to go with
form over function and it's really going
to be up to you to decide whether that
premium design is worth those sacrifices
because as of right now Samsung seems to
think so the star of the show on the s6
edge is really the display it's a 5.1
inch Super AMOLED screen with quad HD
resolution and at a whopping 577 PPI
this is Samsung's sharpest screen yet
say what you will about quad HD but
there's no denying that the screen is
gorgeous obviously since it's Super
AMOLED you get all the great
characteristics that you come to expect
like deep blacks high contrast ratios
and saturated colors the color
calibration can still be adjusted
further in the settings if the default
settings don't quite suit your tastes at
6 iron it's worth of brightness the
screen is extremely vivid and easy to
see in broad daylight and everything
from web browsing games and video look
absolutely fantastic on it what sets the
s6 edge apart though and the reason for
its name is the way the glass spills
over onto the sides and disappears into
the metal frame this time around it's on
both sides of the display meaning you
don't have to flip it upside down if
you're left-handed like on the note edge
and no longer are the edges a separate
piece either and instead it is now one
single display these edges bring about
neat software tricks specific to the s6
edge itself which we will get into a
little later on but what I really love
about the curved edges is the swiping
experience it's extremely smooth and
seamless and plays very well with all
these slide-out elements found all over
Android 5.0 also when you're sliding
elements in and out from the edges
there's a certain illusion that is
created it appears as if the UI is
rolling in from underneath the glass as
you swipe inwards and disappearing
nicely as you push back outwards at 5.1
inches the s6 edge will still be within
the realm of one-handed use for most
people but what I think a lot of people
are going to be really curious about is
how the s6 edge feels in the hand is it
awkward is it more difficult to hold and
the answer to those questions is no it's
not any more difficult to hold than a
foam with a normal flat display and even
though the edges run all the way down
into the metal the actual display
portion doesn't and what you're actually
holding in the hand is metal and bezel
so the screen is any more prone to
accidental taps or presses than a phone
with a regular flat screen and with the
way that Samsung has implemented the
features that take advantage of the edge
design they're actually really difficult
to trigger unless you're intentionally
trying to do so it's been a while since
we've seen an X and O's powered
smartphone from samsung here in the
States
but this year Samsung opted to not go
with Qualcomm for whatever reasons that
maybe is discussion for another day but
globally the s6 edge is being powered by
Samsung's latest Exynos 7420 and 3
gigabytes of RAM with specs like these
and the software optimizations that
Samsung has made this year the s6 edge
is just blazing fast Samsung has really
taken their criticism to heart and the
sluggishness that is typically
associated with samsung devices is not
present here the s6 edge flies through
everything from navigating through the
UI jumping in and out of applications
multitasking gaming you name it the s6
edge does it all without skipping a beat
the animations throughout the UI have
also been cleaned up to make the phone
feel just as fast as it should to show
off this new processor even more Samsung
has implemented a double tap on the home
button that launches the camera and only
0.7 seconds now all isn't perfect here
there is one glaring hiccup that I
noticed
that had to do with the my magazine
homescreen swiping over into my magazine
is now faster than ever as Samsung got
rid of the slow animation but when
swiping back out of it you'll have to
pause for a second before you can swipe
again it feels as if the my magazine
home screen is not fully integrated into
the touchwiz launcher like how Google
now is with the Google now launcher or
blinkfeed
is on sense thus causing the delay this
only occurs if you have my magazine
enabled but if you don't you'll never
notice it and since it's software
related Samsung will surely fix it you
should never let one bad apple spoil the
bunch and that's exactly what this is
and judging by the raw power and
performance at the Exynos 7420 delivers
there's no reason for Samsung not to
stick to their guns with expandable
storage and removable battery gone from
the equation Samsung has done a few
things to augment the hardware situation
the galaxy s6 edge now starts off with
32 gigabytes of storage with 64 and a
128 gigabyte options also available
wireless charging is now natively
built-in and Samsung is utilizing a dual
charging technology that allows the s6
edge to work with both WPC and PMA
standards what that means in English is
the s6 edge will work on pretty much any
wireless charger you can find giving you
a variety of charging options the heart
rate monitor makes a return but is now
in a vertical orientation and it seems
to work more effectively because of it
the fingerprint scanner on the home
button has also been improved it's now a
touch and hold type versus the
cumbersome swipe method that was used
previously and it's so much faster and
easier to use than ever before as far as
speaker quality is concerned the newly
mounted bottom speaker is surprisingly
loud for a single speaker and can easily
be heard even in loud environments but
it suffers from the same issue that all
bottom mounted speakers suffer from the
audio fire sideways and is easily
muffled by the hand when in landscape
regardless this is still one of the
better sounding single firing speakers
that Samsung has used as of late
Samsung has also decided to ditch their
ISO cell camera technology in favour of
what might be considered a more
traditional sensor but this change is
really for the better it's a 16
megapixel sensor with OAS which just
wasn't possible with ISO cell and it
features a very wide aperture at F 1.9
the camera UI has been cleaned up and
simplified and many users should find a
lot quicker and easier to navigate you
have basic camera settings like filters
and HDR mode which now features an auto
mode that takes the guesswork out of
when you should use HDR camera modes are
easily accessible by swiping to the
right or tapping the mode button in the
bottom right corner the camera modes
have also been slimmed down to just a
few like panorama selective focus and a
pro mode for full manual controls with
the option to download more a new one
called virtual shot has been added
allowing to take a full 360 degree view
of an object and it looks really cool on
the viewfinder but it's not something
that can easily be shown on social media
the picture quality is the most
important and the camera absolutely
delivers pictures are super sharp
colorful and full of detail and the
shutter speed is extremely quick and
more often than not I got exactly the
image I wanted on the first try
the tracking autofocus is a nice touch
especially for moving objects like cars
or pets and the F 1.9 aperture gives off
a natural bokeh effect that just can't
be beaten by fancy software tricks that
some cameras out there are trying to
compensate with HDR also works well on
this camera to bring out some extra
detail it's not overly aggressive like
some other cameras but sometimes you'll
be hard-pressed to see much of a
difference between the standard shot and
the HDR shot 4k video recording is also
possible and even though video
stabilization is disabled in this mode
the built-in OAS prevents the video from
becoming overly shaky
the camera is also pretty phenomenal in
low-light and what I've realized is you
can't always trust what you see in the
viewfinder the viewfinder may show a
grainy and colorless image but once you
take the photo it's a completely
different result and that's a testament
to how well Samsung's camera software
handles post-processing the low-light
images may appear slightly muddy in the
darker spots of the photos but the
post-processing does a great job of
cleaning up the excess noise providing
for an overall sharp looking image
especially at the point of focus
Samsung cameras have always historically
been pretty good but Samsung has
definitely raised the bar here and it's
going to be up to other Android
manufacturers to keep up battery life
has been a major area of concern since
the announcement of this current
generation Galaxy S line as the battery
capacity will be deemed small at 2600
milliamp hours especially when you take
the quad HD display into account one
thing to be aware of though is the
Exynos 7420 features a 14 nanometer
process that is much more energy
efficient but the battery life merely
just catches up to phones with lower
resolution displays that's not to say
that the battery life on the s6 edge is
bad because this is exactly the type of
improvements that we need in order to
improve battery life versus just
slapping a larger battery into a phone
the s6 edge will definitely get through
a full day of use and if you're used to
charging your phone every night this
won't be an issue but you shouldn't
expect the screen on time to go very far
beyond the 4 hour mark among the many
improvements to the hardware also comes
many improvements to the software the s6
edge is running on Android 5.0 lollipop
with a completely revamped version of
TouchWiz it's lighter it's cleaner and
most importantly it's fast
Samsung finally got rid of all these
slow animations like the folders for
example the settings menu is no longer
the convoluted mess it once was and all
the blip and blue nature sounds that
haven't made any sense for the longest
time have all been replaced with more
simplified click sounds the color scheme
is still pretty much the same as before
but it's more pastel like an appearance
so it's not quite as
in your face and the beauty of TouchWiz
now is that you can theme it the
built-in theme engine allows for a
complete UI change from the icons
wallpapers sounds native applications
and UI elements like the notification
shade the options right now are pretty
bare but as time goes on you can expect
more themes to be available
Samsung didn't stop there though there's
40 percent less blow over previous
versions of TouchWiz but some staple
apps like s health and s voice are still
present but s voice is no longer tied to
the home button and a lot of these apps
can easily be disabled or uninstalled a
lot of the gimmicky features like air
gestures and toolbox are also gone but
the more useful staple features like
multi window smart stay and palm swipe
to capture have been kept in tact one of
the software features that many probably
won't talk about is the keyboard
Samsung's keyboard has been completely
redone from the ground up it's extremely
accurate and easy to type on and it's
one of the first keyboards that I've
used in a long time that I didn't feel
compelled to replace right away with the
Google keyboard in a lot of ways it's
very comparable to the Google keyboard
in terms of its accuracy and word
prediction and that really says a lot
about how much time Samsung has spent on
revitalizing their software now we can't
talk about software without mentioning
the features that take advantage of the
s6 edges curved glass these can be set
to be either on the left or right side
of the edge depending on if your left or
right handed but the four features that
Samsung has implemented are edge
lighting people edge information stream
and night clock with edge lighting the
edge of the screen will light up when
you receive calls or notifications and
can be dismissed by simply placing your
finger on the heart rate monitor also if
the people edge is enabled the colors
will light up accordingly to what has
been assigned to each individual contact
speaking of the people edge this feature
allows you to add up to 5 of your
favorite contacts that are easily
accessible from a swipe on the top
portion of the display from here you can
call or text them and if you have a
missed call or text message from any of
your contacts
it'll place additional tabs on the edge
of the display so you can easily respond
with information streams this will allow
you to view various different streams
like Twitter Yahoo News and sports
scores for example tapping on a stream
will take you into its respective app
if you want to see more and you can also
download additional streams if you'd
like the implementation however is a
little bit clunky as you have to swipe
quickly back and forth across the edge
to activate it and it just doesn't feel
intuitive the final feature is called
night clock and this is pretty
self-explanatory the edge can be used as
a night clock and you can set the hours
at night for it to automatically come on
so that it's on when you go to bed and
off when you wake up in the morning some
may view these features as gimmicky and
personally I think people edge and night
clock are going to be the ones that
people use the most because what they
display like this I don't think very
many people are going to want to set
their phones facedown in order to take
advantage of the edge lighting and like
I said the implementation of the
information stream is just a little bit
clunky and not very intuitive and I
think it would have been better to maybe
see a DoubleTap to activate the
information stream versus the awkward
swipe gesture that they have going on
right now but like most Samsung features
these can easily be ignored or
completely disabled if you don't want
them but if you really think about it
not utilizing any of these features sort
of defeats the purpose of the edge
design in regards to price you can
expect the galaxy s6 edge to be priced
at a premium of the s6 so far only
t-mobile and 18t have come forward with
pricing with t-mobile coming in just shy
of seven hundred and eighty dollars for
the 32 gigabyte model and it only goes
up accordingly based on storage the 18 t
version will be available at is starting
cost of 815 dollars and we can expect
the remaining carriers to be priced
similarly as you may have already seen
the s6 edge will be available in four
different colors which may vary
depending on carrier but with all the
different storage options and colors
available users will have plenty of
choices to pick from the edge has grown
up and is no longer the experiment that
it was on the note edge and we'll be
seeing the s6 edge being marketed just
as heavily as the regular s6 if not more
so the edge is now one of many parts of
Samsung's new identity going forward and
I can't help but think that the s6 was
more or less a safety net for Samsung
just in case the edge doesn't sell so
who knows maybe next year we'll be back
to one phone and the edge will be a
default feature as for this year you'll
have to ask yourself the question
to edge or not to edge as for me I'm
going with the edge as always guys
