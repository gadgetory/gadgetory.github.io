Joe handy the Android authority app guy
do you like racing games I know I do and
today we'll be taking a look at some of
the best racing games for Android first
on our list is asphalt 7 this popular
and well known racer has been around for
a while and is a crowd favorite you race
around tracks and speeds even NASCAR
wouldn't against opponents who regularly
try to knock you off course and out of
the way the gas is pressed automatically
and you tilt your phone to steer you can
tap the left side of the screen for
brakes and the right side to activate
knobs once you get into it it's not a
difficult game to play and there are
plenty of opportunities to upgrade cars
and go even faster next on the list is
CSR racing for our regular viewers you
may have noticed that we review this app
a little while ago so we're not going to
talk much about it in this video since
there's that whole review for you guys
to check out if you want to see more
about CSR racing that said the game is a
lot of fun and has a lot of addicting
qualities it's a drag racing style of
game with a lot of modern vehicles for
you racing enthusiasts out there it's
free it's fun its addicting and it even
looks really good can't ask for any more
in a racing app if you're more into
tuning the car and less into things like
graphics then drag racing may be for you
it has the same controls as CSR racing
however that's where the similarities
end the graphics are not very good
compared to CSR and asphalt but this
also has a lot more to offer where this
game really shines is the tuning you can
buy upgrades just like you normally
would however you can then tune the car
the customization is really quite
in-depth you can tune the car gear by
gear how much nos gets used and all
sorts of other variables Plus unlike CSR
you can race tracks that are longer than
half a mile you guys didn't think we'd
do a racing list and only put car games
on there did you next up is highway
rider this game features motorcycles and
it definitely does not take itself
seriously like these other games do do
you have a virtual death wish then this
game is for you there are two modes an
arcade mode and a fugitive mode in
fugitive mode you race against cops to
remain a free man trying to survive as
long as possible
you get boosts by passing closeby cars
when you lose the game tallies up your
broken bones to see how bad you hurt
yourself really it's a win win the last
game on our list will make fans of the
old wave race game for the Nintendo 64
have a wave of nostalgia silly jokes
aside Riptide GP is a racing game that
deals with jet skis instead of
and is actually reminiscent of the old
n64 classic the controls are about what
you'd expect from a racer tapping the
left screen brakes the right side
accelerates tap the meter for boost and
tilt the phone to steer you earn boost
by performing tricks mid-air we like the
graphics especially the water splash on
the screen after big jumps if you take a
look at our leaderboard you can see how
all these apps stack up against one
another as per the norm we did not rate
these ourselves you guys did we just put
them in order if you want to check them
out there are Appling in the video
description
we knew this app list would be a
challenge because we wanted to put more
than just games that race cars so there
may have been a few good ones that we
missed out on we do already know that
we're gonna get a lot of flack from Real
Racing 3 fans and we wish we could have
added it but it got beat out in the
ratings by just a little bit by asphalt
7 as usual if there's any racing game
you think should have made the list but
did not let us know in the comments
once again I'm Joe Hendy the Android
authority app guy feel free to subscribe
to our YouTube channel and check out the
written version of this video and our
social media links in the video
