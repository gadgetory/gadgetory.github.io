really quick obviously it has less or
lesser specs i should say than the l7
and it kind of shows already when you're
just looking at the phone it is a 4 inch
display I for now it's a 4-inch display
true color IPS also with a WVGA display
so kind of in the hand it feels a little
bit more like the plastic II feel rather
than my matted back of the l7 it is a
lot smaller though so you can grip it
very well those point 3 inches value
really make a difference here and it's
definitely a pocketable phone something
that will fit pretty much any pocket you
have and it gets only smaller from there
from the l3 that being said though the
art there are differences in the
internals on the l5 a 1 gigahertz
mediatek single core processor is
powered by a power vr sgx 531 for
graphics other than that there's a 5
megapixel camera on the back instead and
the battery is brought down to 1,700
milliamp hours nonetheless it is a small
like I said there seems to be a nice
sturdiness to these phones so you can
really bounce this thing around you
probably not gonna have any problems so
that is the l5 2
LG and finally we have the optimus l3 to
this is a bit of a special version of it
though and I wanted to make sure to
cover this one the l5 and the l3 to do
have versions that are dual sim capable
there's actually a button right here to
be able to switch between the two sinks
so we're just going to take a look here
first of all obviously we're dealing
with a very small 3.2 inch display again
IPS at an IPS displayed just like the
other two it's very small this one has
demanded back so I'm not too sure what
happened with the l5 but anyway feels
really small in the hand there's no
other way to say it but nonetheless it
does still feel sturdy just like the
other two phones and to be honest the
one of the nice things about this phone
is the fact that the performance
actually seems to be quite good always
keeps going back to the movie there so
you are getting jellybean 4.1 on all of
these devices so that project butter is
definitely showing here it's all buttery
smooth still still really nice I could
see this being a pretty popular phone
with people who actually really like the
small displays they're not looking for
anything too special out of their phones
I just want it to work this is
definitely a device that just works that
being said underneath the screen there
is a one bigger one gigahertz single
core MediaTek processor just like in the
l5 a 3 megapixel camera this time so 3
5 on the five and there is a micro SD
card slot in here so this is able to
have expandable memory those are some of
the few specs that are available now of
course there is also a 1540 mill and
battery inside so there there is going
to be quite a bit of life inside of this
little this little guy right here so
that being said these are the three l
two phones by LG this is the L Series
very very interesting to know that there
are dual SIM capability inside of the l3
and the l5 so for those of you that look
for that kind of functionality out fee
has given you a couple of choices there
so thank you ever thank you very much
everybody that this has been Joshua
pegard android authority we're coming to
you live from the Mobile World Congress

to get as much done as we can and stay
