over 4.7 inches who wouldn't want to put
a screen protector on their HTC One
what's up guys I'm Clayton young we're
here with Android a 30.com and today my
goal is to show you three of my favorite
screen protectors for the HTC One
so today we're checking out three
different types of screen protectors
we're looking at the zag invisible
shield which is a wet application screen
protector we're also looking at the
bodyguards screen guards which can be
wet or dry and then we're looking at
classic screen where screen protectors
without further ado we're gonna jump in
and check out the screen where consort
protection screen protector now these
are more classic protectors in a sense
that they do not use any application gel
or fluid and they simply have an
adhesive back now the package comes with
five and screen protectors it also comes
with a cleaning cloth and the card stock
to help you smooth out air bubbles now
the cleaning cloth is the first step in
installing the screen protector so we're
going to use that to get all of the dust
off of the HTC One we're also going to
want to make sure we have clean fingers
so we don't get any residue on the
actual screen protector then going to
peel off one side of the screen
protector much like screen protectors of
the past and corner it in order to get a
clean install after it is set on the
face of your device you can use the
included card stock to smooth out the
air bubbles making sure you got all of
them you want to remove the second piece
of plastic now you might see some new
air bubbles forming while the second
piece gets removed but don't worry
because you can smooth those out with
the card stock simply work your way out
to the edges and the corners might be
tough but most people have installed
screen protectors of this nature in the
end it looks pretty great you can see I
had a little bit of damage in the corner
but most of my corners went on flat and
you can see that it almost has an anti
glare feature it looks very very nice on
HTC One and it will provide a lot of
protection now I had the phone in my
pocket with keys and we're gonna
simulate a test if the keys were in
there all day and actually scratched the
phone I am using moderate to heavy
pressure on the screen of the HTC One
and I'm actually tapping the keys as
well you can see what you did get a few
scratches in the screen where a screen
protector but we're just gonna lift this
up to show that none of the scratches
were sustained in the display of the
device and the screen wear protectors
did their job perfectly
next on the list is the bodyguards
ultimate screen protector this is a wet
screen protector with a list of features
and it comes with application gel a card
stock and cleaning cloths as well as two
protectors per pack now the first step
in installing a wet application screen
protector is always to power your device
off you don't want to be working with
the solution while your device is on
next we'll slide out our stickers that
are included and our cleaning cloth and
as always we're gonna want to clean the
screen and have clean hands during
installation now in order to install
these screen guards just peel off the
white backing and you'll reveal the
adhesive side of the screen guard this
can be installed wet or dry but more
streaking occurs when it's installed dry
to install wet we're just going to grab
our application gel and drop a few
dollops on
then we can working on with our finger
or a similar tool we don't want to use
too much I did use a little bit too much
but I cleaned it up with the cleaning
cloth
so next to just line up the screen
protector with the body of the HTC one
and set it on top the application gel
allows you to move it around slightly so
you don't actually have to set it on
perfectly after that you just gonna use
your fingers in the included card stock
to smooth out the air bubbles and
streaks under the screen protector you
can clean up any excess fluid with your
cleaning cloth and then remove the top
layer as you can see it's pretty
malleable and I did lift up the screen
protector but it doesn't much matter
because it sets back down and adheres
perfectly again just work your air
bubbles out with the card stock when
you're near finish getting the air
bubbles out make sure to collect all of
the residue from the application gel
because you don't want to following in
the speakers of the HTC One after
installation it looks fairly decent and
I'm really impressed with the protection
now we do have some streaking but
usually goes away within 72 hours we can
then power on our HTC One and check out
how the screen looks as you can see I
have a little bit of folding up at the
edge but you can work that down with
your finger it looks beautiful with the
screen guard on and it's nearly
impossible to get a scratch in the
device as you can see I put some hard
scratches in with the card stock we're
going to see how the device fared under
the screen protector
now you'll want to at least wait two to
three minutes before receding the screen
protector if you have to but I'm peeling
mine off just for demonstration purposes
let me try and push a pencil through the
actual body of the screen guards because
it's very very strong and extremely
malleable
and you can see that with almost full
force I can't even get the pencil
through the screen protector the final
screen protector we're checking out
today's zag invisible shield now it
comes with installation instructions a
squeegee cloths and application solution
as always we're going to power down our
HTC One before we install the screen
protector now the first step is to
actually get the application solution on
the tips of your fingers when you handle
the screen protector it doesn't adhere
to your fingers
they're gonna peel the screen protector
up and put application solution on that
peel it up gently but it is fairly
malleable and you won't tear the screen
protector after removing it from the
backing simply put a few squirts on it
with application solution it doesn't
dispense much so you won't need more
than a few pumps
and never spray the application solution
directly on the face of the phone then
just like with the bodyguards simply put
on the face of your HTC one and begin to
get it in place by moving it with the
application solution under it after it's
fairly in place you're going to use the
included squeegee which happens to be
rubber and is quite useful to get the
rest of the air bubbles out
the invisible shield was really fun to
install because the air bubbles an
application solution came out much
easier than on the screen guards next
we're going to repeat the process with
the back film you can line it up using
your camera lens and then you're just
gonna use your squeegee to get all of
the applications solution out just like
imma front now the back is a little bit
trickier so you're gonna want to take
your time you can also set your phone
under a heat lamp or use the cool
setting on a hairdryer to help speed up
the application process but never
overheat the HTC One here's the HTC One
after the invisible shield has dried
quite some time as you can see most of
my air bubbles are gone but I still
haven't powered on my device now the
invisible shield provides substantial
enough protection but if you do find
yourself needing the case it's often a
concern whether or not the full-body
protection is gonna allow the phone to
fit into a case here I put my HTC one
with the full-body protection on in a
case may case and it fit and performed
perfectly we also want to give a big
shout out and thanks to mobile phone
comm for providing us with the screen
protectors for this video and many more
to come
alright everyone so now that we've seen
all three of these screen protectors in
action on the beautiful HTC One which
one of you guys could Iraq I'm
personally gonna stay with this zag
invisible shield because it's the
full-body protection and you can't beat
being able to rock your phone naked I
also like the bodyguards and I do like
the classic screen protectors as well so
anyways I'm going to leave links for all
of these screen protectors in the
description and you guys should comment
saying which screen protector that you
would Rock on your HTC one as always
thank you for watching this is Clayton
