brought to you by domain.com has Samsung
been listening to us geeks perhaps
because it looks like they're putting
microSD card support in the galaxy a7
the Galaxy a7 is expected to ship with a
5.5 inch full HD display a 1.5 gigahertz
Snapdragon 615 system and a chip with an
Adreno 405 GPU 3 gigabytes RAM 16
gigabytes of on-board storage and will
allegedly feature a 13 megapixel rear
facing camera and a 5 megapixel front
facing camera it will purportedly ship
with Android 5.1.1 and also be made of
metal presumably it will also include
microSD card support now the Galaxy a5
is expected to ship with a 5.2 inch full
HD display and a 1.6 octa-core exynos
7420 gigabytes of on-board storage the
a5 includes a 13 megapixel rear cam and
a 5 megapixel front-facing camera it
ships with android 5.1.1 and will
include microSD card support and again
the body is expected to be made of metal
while the gold-coloured variant of the
galaxy a5 pictured here clearly looks
like it has a metallic back the a7 at
least from this shot here almost looks
like it's made of glass
due to the reflective surface which
clearly looks the same as the front of
the device this could be a lighting
issue or it could even be a coating on
the metal itself or it could actually be
glass do you remember earlier this year
when Samsung announced that they were
gonna scale down the number of different
models they produced I guess not
everyone got that memo because they've
now produced the Galaxy j-3 or shall I
say the Samsung Galaxy j-3 6 which just
made its debut in China yes the circled
6 is part of the actual name of the
device our best guess is that it has
something to do with the auspicious
nature the number 6 has in Chinese
culture a technology that thus far has
been confined to the upper echelons of
Samsung's product line the fact that
AMOLED is making its way down range
could be a sign that Samsung is pulling
all
stops in its fight with the Chinese
manufacturers that have taken the
entry-level market by storm to other
premium features are rumored to be
coming to cheap Samsung devices soon ie
Samsung pay and fingerprint sensors
other specs of the galaxy j3 six include
an unspecified quad-core processor
clocked at 1.2 gigahertz 1.5 gigabytes
of RAM just eight gigabytes of
expandable storage and an 8 megapixel
rear camera a 5 megapixel front camera
and a generous 2600 milliamp hour
battery now for those of you who are
fans of the redmi line from xiaomi you
should know they have a big announcement
tomorrow this teaser image features the
words grand finale in Chinese at the top
as well as a launch date of Tuesday
November 24th at the bottom the
festivities are scheduled to take place
at the Beijing National Convention
Center according to my drivers it should
be noted that the image doesn't
specifically mention the redmi note 2
Pro though we're still pretty certain
that the teaser image is referring to
the rumored device the redmi note 2 pro
will feature a smooth metal body design
with a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner
which is a first for xiaomi it will wear
approximately 165 grams compared to the
redmi note 2 s 160 grams it will also
feature a 5.5 inch 1080p display a
mediatek helio x10 processor 2 gigabytes
of ram 16 gigabytes of on-board storage
a 13 megapixel rear cam and a 5
megapixel front-cam and a big
3060 milliamp hour battery these may not
seem quite like pro specs at first
glance but for the rumored price of just
172 bucks
we'd say the phone will be well worth it
