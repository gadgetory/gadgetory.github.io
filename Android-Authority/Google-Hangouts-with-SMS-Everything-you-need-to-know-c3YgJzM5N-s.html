handy the Android authority app guy
hangouts with SMS is coming very soon
and a leaked apk let us get our hands on
it just a little bit early so in this
video we're going to check out some of
the new features with hangouts okay most
people know the main features of
hangouts at this point so we won't waste
your time by going over the old stuff
the first thing you'll notice upon
opening the new hangouts is the
immediate option to turn on SMS you can
either do it right then and there or you
can do it later in the settings once SMS
is enabled all your feeds will load
including existing SMS messages if you
have any many people have reported that
they can't tell which feed they're using
and those people are silly there are
giant SMS symbols in the pictures when
it's an SMS conversation and speech
bubbles in the chat will say it as well
it's really not that hard
you can turn SMS off and on in the
settings it's really very simple for
such an important new feature next up
we'll talk about gifs support you can
send gifs to other users which only adds
to the experience of using hangouts we
have a leak copy so our gifs sends had a
few minor glitches but these are
expected to be ironed out when it's
actually released to send them just add
them like you would any other picture
also included our location messages just
tap the little google map symbol and you
can automatically send your location to
anyone if they tap on that it will open
that location up in maps where they can
get directions if they need them it's a
really useful feature and really easy to
use lastly we'll talk about mode
settings you can set your mood so people
online will know how you are feeling
it's not really an important update but
again it adds to the overall experience
also there are little icons that will
show what devices your friends are on
it'll show a phone if they're on mobile
and a computer if they're on a computer
again not overly important but in
addition to the experience that's about
it folks the overall experience won't
change that much but with the added
features it makes hangouts much more fun
to use and you can finally say goodbye
to that stock SMS app once again I'm Joe
