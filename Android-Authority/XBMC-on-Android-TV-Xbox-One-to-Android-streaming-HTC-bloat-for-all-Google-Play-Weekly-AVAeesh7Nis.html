handy the Android authority app guy and
it's Friday so you know what that means
this week we have a lot of awesome stuff
to talk about so let's get right to it
first up let's take a look at what
Google updated this week Google search
was updated again and now has improved
transportation reminders for buses and
trains as well as the ability to update
your flight status if you're planning to
fly somewhere YouTube reportedly
introduced 1440 support in their mobile
app but it appears as though it's only
available on some devices some of the
time which is not unlike their current
1080p settings
lastly Google Play Music all access was
rolled out to nine new countries in
South and Central America including
Ecuador Paraguay the Dominican Republic
Panama Nicaragua and others libreoffice
has announced that they're going to be
porting their popular office suite to
mobile starting with Android
according to the announcement they'll be
bringing it to Android first because
apparently about 90% of their code is
already all good to run on Android open
source and open document fans should be
happy about this move because open
document support has been pretty much
absent on mobile so far there's no word
yet on when it'll be done but we do know
that it's being worked on HTC is trying
something a little bit different by
releasing their exclusive applications
for everyone to use word is that they'll
be releasing HTC Zoe first which is a
feature on the 1-series to let you put
some photos together with a soundtrack
to create a Zoe or essentially a
slideshow with music this is an
interesting move because it's been
apropos for OEMs to not release to
proprietary apps because those are the
features that make their devices unique
apparently HTC has done with all that
and they're going in a more software
oriented direction the application
formerly known as XBMC now called Cody
has been spotted working on Android TV
there really isn't all that much to say
here a Google+ user whose name I don't
feel like butchering this week made a
huge speaks to XBMC source compiled it
and it ran surprisingly well on his
Android TV developer box this is good
news if you're into Kodi and it's
definitely encouraging that it ran
pretty much flawlessly with minimal
efforts for some people this means
they'll be buying an Android TV device
when they eventually come out in our
last bit of news this week Microsoft has
announced that Xbox one will soon be
able to stream television to Android
most Xbox and Android owners are
familiar with the
SmartGlass application for now it's a
fun little remote but it doesn't do much
more than that
after this planned update you'll be able
to use the application to stream TV
shows from your Xbox one to your Android
device so far it's only been announced
so we don't know too many of the details
which means keep an eye out because
we'll know more soon so who wants to see
some trending applications as usual if
you want to check any of these
applications out you can find the links
in the Brittain companion which is in
the video description below your window
weather is a newer weather application
that focuses more on design than on
functionality it does show the weather
and you can view our by our forecasts
using a very attractive slider feature
it looks nice and comes with a live
wallpaper if you want it to look even
nicer it lacks some features but it
makes up for it with good looks Google
Plus got a couple of updates in the last
week or so included in the update was a
lightly tweaked UI that doesn't look all
that different but it's one of those
you'll know it when you see it kind of
things also included was chromecast
support so you can now cast your photos
and videos directly to your TV through
the application which was actually kind
of cool
t-mobile has released an application
that promises to unlock devices on their
network so they can be used on other
networks right now it only works on the
Samsung Avon but we expect support for
more devices to roll out eventually
seriously it only works for the Avant so
giving it a one star ready because it
doesn't support all devices yet is kind
of stupid don't be that guy no one likes
that guy duet is a new minimal brain
teaser game that is actually quite a bit
of fun and those who tune in every week
no I don't usually prefer minimal games
this one mixes an atmospheric soundtrack
with simple graphics and a difficult to
master gameplay premise where you must
rotate two balls around objects and
avoid collisions the core game is free
and you can get extra stuff if you fork
out the $3 tap path is a new application
from Chris Lacey who also brought us
link bubble with this application you
can actually choose how links are opened
if you single click it'll open a web
browser but you can also double click or
triple click and have it do things like
automatically add the link to pocket or
do other things with other applications
it's pretty useful and can save people a
ton of time so you should definitely
check it out if you want to stay up to
date on the latest and greatest in
Android news and reviews I recommend
