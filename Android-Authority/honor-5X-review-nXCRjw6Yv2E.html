and this is the honor 5x the first honor
smartphone for the US market now this
phone offers a beautiful and premium
design a fingerprint scanner and the 5.5
inch screen all for just $199 now that's
a very good deal but let's see if this
phone is truly worth picking up let's
start with the design of the otter 5x
because as you can see the back of this
phone is entirely made from this brushed
metal which is something you don't see
too often from phones in this price
range it gives it a very premium look
and feel although can be a bit slippery
the metal here certainly isn't the most
high-grade metal as is easily prone to
scratching so you will have to be a
little more cautious when handling the
phone or setting it down on tables while
even the size are made of metal the top
and bottom are made from plastic but you
won't be able to tell just from looking
the volume and power buttons can be
found on the right side and they feel
very nice with a good amount of tactile
feedback they certainly do not feel
cheap and with the power button and
volume buttons having a textured grippy
pattern to them you'll have a very
pleasant experience controlling volumes
you'll find the headphone jack on the
top with the micro USB charging port and
speaker being on the bottom it's a
pretty light device at only 158 grams
and not too thick either at eight point
two millimeters also there's a little
LED notification light at the top and
overall for a $200 phone to support this
metallic backing we are very impressed
as you power on the display you'll be
greeted with a nice 5.5 inch IPS LCD
panel at a resolution of 1080 by 1920
and the quality here is actually very
good colors are vibrant while not being
too oversaturated and without the whites
being too warm or too cool you'll notice
a back light shining through in darker
areas however more so than most LCD
panels and there's also a notably large
black border around the screen which may
be a bit of an eyesore to some people
especially if you choose a white front
but those are really the only areas
where this nice-looking display falls
short the display can get very bright
giving you no problems outdoors and with
a 1080p resolution on this 5.5 inch
screen text remains very
been clear running this phone is a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 processor with
an adrenal 405 GPU and 2 gigs of ram
with this processing package of course
you shouldn't expect this to be the
fastest phone on the market but you
should expect some really nice
performance here
however the Snapdragon 615 seems to be a
little more sluggish here then we would
be used to on other phones that also use
it animations will be choppy from time
to time and some apps may take an extra
second to open there's a bit of a delay
when pressing on keyboards and this is
also an area where the phone may freeze
for a full second or two also when
navigating through apps and the recent
apps screen expect some app refreshes as
well overall though it's not a huge
difference compared to other phones
powered by the Snapdragon 615 and really
these extra stutters may be due to the
lack of polish on huawei's emui software
Geekbench give the phone a single core
score of 700 with a multi-core score of
3165 and tu2 has some lower scores too
at only twenty six thousand six hundred
and seventy-three as for battery we have
a three thousand milliamp non-removable
battery inside and I was actually very
surprised at how good battery life was
on this thing even on a day where I was
heavily testing the phone's camera and
gaming performance I was able to get six
hours of screen on time very impressive
if you take advantage of EMU eyes
battery saving options that lower CPU
and network usage to promote better
battery life you'll get some crazy
numbers and when using smart mode I was
able to get an extra hour of screen on
time things start to get interesting
with honor 5x when it comes to hardware
as we have a fingerprint scanner found
on the back like most of Honor's lineup
the placement of rear fingerprint
scanners has really grown on me over the
last couple of months and I do think is
the best place for a fingerprint scanner
to go when in your hand the device can
easily be unlocked without any awkward
Hamden asacs whichever way you may hold
your phone your finger is always going
to be ready to tap that scanner but what
makes the scanner great is the fact that
you don't need to first push the power
button to have the scanner begin reading
once your finger makes contact with the
scanner whether the screen is on or off
your print will be red and fast too
although not as fast as the Nexus 6p it
gets very close and is very reliable
it's awesome to see a fingerprint
scanner on such a cheap phone especially
one of this quality since your pointer
finger is always resting on or near the
enter it makes sense to have the scanner
serve additional purposes and that's
exactly what it does with gestures so
swiping up shows a recent apps screen a
tap will take you back and tapping and
holding takes you home and you can even
answer calls stop alarms and take photos
with the scanner so Iping down on the
fingerprint scanner pulls down the
notification page which is very helpful
given how hard it is to reach the top of
this 5.5 inch screen is definitely a
feature that I've gotten into the habit
of using and I know when I switch to
another phone I'm going to be sad to see
it go with such a fast and reliable
fingerprint scanner full of useful
gestures I'd have to say this is
definitely one of the best ones on the
market right now the speaker is placed
on the bottom right so it can easily be
covered up when gaming or watching
videos which is unfortunate but is even
more unfortunate is its sound quality
which is very muffled and almost seems
too started even at lower volumes when
it comes to storage you only have one
option at 16 gigs which is pretty small
but forgivable since the honor 5x allows
for microSD card expansion up to 128
gigs this phone also features dual SIM
cards for micro SIM cards or nano SIM
cards the honor 5x is running android
5.1.1 out of the box however there's a
heavily skinned emui 3.1 which is a norm
for all of Honor's lineup this will
probably split a lot of users and may
actually be a deal-breaker for some it's
not bad but with a lack of an app drawer
being one of the more questionable
decisions it can really make users feel
limited with their customization you're
going to have to resort to folder making
which can still not look the greatest
and can take a lot of planning and time
but there's nothing stopping you from
during a launcher on here to change your
homescreen there's also some silly
features that show up sometimes like
consumption reminders which warned you
about apps consuming too much power even
though most of the time you see these
pop up right after actually using the
app the recent apps screen looks
something similar to an older kick head
version of Android and even with this
harsh reskin some stock Android features
shine through ever so often like with
the emojis that have been unaltered not
all of this reskin is bad Bo the
Notification pulldown is very well
organized into two parts one for
notifications and one for shortcuts this
saves a lot of room allowing for lots of
notifications to be displayed at once
a Mui 3.1 really shows a lot of detail
here too if you do need to get into
shortcuts a simple swipe to the left
will do and if you think about it this
rescan saves a lot more room than you'd
be used to on stock Android with this
timeline on the Left showing exact times
for received notifications you'll feel
very organized if the lack of an app
drawer isn't a big concern for you you
decide to stick with emu eyes home
screen you do have a lot of customizable
options as well like themes transition
animations homescreen grid and even fun
features like shake to realign icons and
auto align this software definitely is
going to turn a lot of users away which
is unfortunate as there's nothing
stopping Huawei from slapping a more
slimmed down version of Android on to
the 5x but at the same time a lot of
users will have a lot of fun with all
the extra features however while way
states that the 5x will receive regular
software updates including marshmallow
emui 4.0 and Android security patches in
a timely manner which is great to hear
and in fact they have already released
this most security update before the
phone was even released so it seems they
are indeed keeping their word now we get
into the camera and with this 13
megapixel sensor aperture of 2.0 and
lack of optical image stabilization the
quality is more the same you would find
on the majority of phones in this price
range in optimal conditions like
outdoors the camera performs to the best
of its ability and really looks nice
pictures tend to have a lot of softness
to them without any type of post
processing or sharpening going on sure
we would have liked to see just a bit
more sharpness to these images but
pictures still seem clear the color
temperature seems to be more towards the
warm side and colors appear to like the
punch of vibrancy as well and lots of
the time areas of photos will be
overexposed
however these issues are very minor and
overall the camera takes pleasing
pictures HDR is there for brightening up
the shadows and it does a great job
although sometimes it will just make the
overall picture brighter which results
in a worse picture as you move into
nighttime shots the camera will try to
compensate for the lack of light by
increasing the shutter speed and without
optical image stabilization photos come
out slightly blurry for a front-facing
camera pictures look pretty decent
although with some extra noise but once
again indoors photos will be a lot less
sharp with lots of noise
you can shoot 1080p
although you'll have to toggle it on in
settings and it can be pretty shaky and
exposing is also an issue here as well
it tries to correct the exposure very
rapidly with harsha's myths that can be
distracting there are some extra
features in video mode as well like
slo-mo and object tracking which is
actually pretty cool you can touch the
object you want to focus on and the
camera will then track and focus on to
that object no matter where you move so
yes the camera definitely has a lot of
room for improvement but this is a two
hundred dollar film that we've been
talking about here and for that price
you really can't complain so is this
phone worth picking up for $200 I would
without any hesitation say yes of course
it's a great Buy this is the only phone
you can purchase at the moment in the US
that has a metal design and a
fingerprint scanner for $200 these are
features you would usually find on more
high-end phones that can cost anywhere
from 400 to 700 dollars these two things
alone make this phone a bargain but on
top of that you have a large 5.5 inch
screen and feature-packed operating
system yes it's marketed as a budget
phone so of course you shouldn't expect
the fastest and smoothest software
experience my biggest gripe with the
phone and I know a lot of you guys would
agree is the lack of an app drawer but
once you slap a custom launcher on top
you'll have an awesome time using this
premium feeling budget phone alright
