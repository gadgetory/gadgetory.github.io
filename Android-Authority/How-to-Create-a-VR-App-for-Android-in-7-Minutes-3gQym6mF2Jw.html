massive way that everyone's been
anticipating it will do just yet but VR
is still definitely going to play a huge
role in the future of tech and the
future of Android VR has almost
limitless potential to change the world
whether that means influencing the way
we create communicate learn or game and
as our mobile devices get more powerful
and computer vision allows for true
inside out tracking much of this is like
to take place on our Android phones but
for now we have Google cardboard and
daydream and the gear VR they're a
little less exciting the new oculus rift
and HTC vibes sure but there's still
some pretty awesome games and
applications here and there are lots of
great reasons for developers to get
involved not only because there's lots
of money to be made in their fledgling
VR app stores but also because it pays
to get ahead of the curve and learn
skills that are likely to be in huge
demand in the next few years and apart
from anything else it's just incredibly
awesome to be able to create your own
virtual world and then step into it so
that further ado let's see if we can
make those eighties dreams a reality and
try to make our own VR experience on
Android in just seven minutes or less so
the first thing we need to do of course
is to open up unity there is we're going
to start a new project even though I've
done this once before is a trial we'll
call it VR app make sure that you've got
3d selected and then click create
project pretty easy okay and here we
have unity if you're not familiar with
using unity then there are plenty of
articles and tutorials over at Android
Authority calm that I've written and
others have written and I'll link to
those in the description also okay so
the first thing we want to do I'm going
to kind of rush through it here for now
the first thing you want to do is to
create a 3d plane that just means a flat
surface and the reason we want that is
so that we can walk on it and I'm going
to make this a little bit larger we've
got plenty of room to move around okay
we can also insert a 3d object which is
a cube here just to add a little bit of
variety to our world if we wanted to
give that physics without a rigidbody
now we want to make this a 3d
first-person shooter type experience so
we're going to go down to assets here
and we're gonna say import package
characters this is going to allow us to
import various ready-made assets you can
of course select just the things you
want from the standard assets here but
for now for simplicity let's just import
everything and give it a moment hold on
okay so now that's created what we're
gonna do is look in the standard assets
here we're going to go to characters
we're gonna go to first person we're
going to prefabs a prefab as a
ready-made a game object it could have
scripts it could have 3d models or
prefabricated hence the name ready for
us to use this is a completely ready
first person character controller and as
you'll see it makes our lives incredibly
simple so just drop it into your scene
from there we want to delete the main
camera here because the first person
controller is now going to act as the
camera and now if you click play you'll
see just how quick and simple everything
was ago we can look around there's that
box we can walk around with the Mazda
keys we can jump this sound effects all
that's been added by that first-person
controller pretty nice and easy believe
it or not that's ready for us to jump
into so the next thing we need to do
first we're gonna save our scene we
could make a folder for that if we
wanted to keep things nice and neat
but for now let's just call it simi a
scene in unity is not to just the level
it also includes all the elements that
you've included so that means things
like this first person character
controller okay so now with that saved
we're ready to set this up to run so
we're gonna go to build settings want to
change our platform to Android so select
that and click switch platform to make
it official once again you need to give
it a couple of seconds we need to hold
on okay and the next thing we need to do
once that's done is to move our scene
into the scenes in build that's
important because without that there
it's not going to know
what to include when it creates our app
now finally click player settings and
this is where you set up the settings
for your app itself the first thing we
need to do is in other settings that's
cool company name Android or authority
and that's called the product name VR
app with no space then I'm going to
change my package name and you need
immunity to be very strict and make sure
that that is the company name and then
the app name we also need to make sure
we're targeting API level 19 because
it's only from there upwards that we can
support Google cardboard so that's done
then we're going to go into X our
settings and just click virtual reality
supported that's the magic sauce right
there you can see here you've got the
opportunity to import virtual reality
SDKs we're going to click the plus there
and we're going to choose cardboard but
of course if you wanted to daydream you
just click daydream and if you wanted
oculus you just click oculus note
however that oculus is a little bit more
complicated because you're also going to
need a signature file from your device
but for these two it's incredibly simple
so just click cardboard and then you can
click build and run and your project is
complete and ready to test on your
device which is pretty amazing really
then you can load it up look around and
explore your 3d world of course for this
to work you need to have your Android
device plugged in and you need to turn
on USB debugging if you can't find that
setting then it'll be in the developer
options in your settings menu if you
don't have access to developer options
you'll need to turn that on you do this
by going to about phone finding the
build number and then tapping on that
seven times it'll then say you're now a
developer you can change those hidden
settings now of course this is all good
and well and pretty amazing really we
don't yet have any way to interact with
the world we can change this however by
clicking FPS controller finding the
first person controller script that's
the code that handles this behavior
going to that two settings menu the
little cog on the right clicking on it
and then saying edit script that less
edit the code
now the good news is that Google
cardboard only has a one input method
that being the magnetic button at the
top and that's pretty easy for us to
override so in here do a search and look
for jump and there you go we've got this
line as long we want em underscore jump
equals cross-platform input manager get
button down jump we're gonna change that
to input get mouse button down zero and
all that's doing is it's swapping the
kind of adaptable jump button for a
mouse click and the good news is that
Android immunity interprets a mouse
click as being the same thing as tapping
the screen anywhere and that also
happens to be the same way that Google
cardboard interprets a click of that
button so this means that now clicking
the button will make our character jump
but you could just as easily make that a
button to make the character move
forwards to make it fire so you can
shoot a target and that's where you can
start to use your imagination and come
up with really cool ideas for new VR
apps like I say we're really only at the
start of this technology right now
there's so much potential that hasn't
been explored giving you the opportunity
to come up with that really killer app
that awesome idea that no one's had
before the only thing holding you back
really is the limits of your imagination
and if you want some ideas and some more
tips on how to create more immersive VR
experiences then once again there's an
article I've written over Android Java
comm and I'll link to that once again in
the description down below so we found
this video useful interesting guys if
you did then please leave like please
share it around that helps us out
immensely let me know in the comments
down below if you have any problems I'll
try and help you out and what you'd like
to see in this tutorial next time of
course check out Android or 30 com if we
are your source for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
