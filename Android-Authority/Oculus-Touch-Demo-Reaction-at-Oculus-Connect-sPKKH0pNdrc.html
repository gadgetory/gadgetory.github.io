bush a set up right here with their logo
I think that's pretty funny hey it's
Josh regard for management authority
what's going on everybody and I'm coming
to you live from the oculus connect the
second year of the Developer Conference
of oculus has for their rift platform
but also with Samsung for the gear VR
platform now there's already a video of
me giving my reactions to the to the
announcements of the new gear gear VR
that comes in at $99 which i think is
really great a very easy price point and
entry point for people who already have
samsung devices and it will bring some
of the best VR experiences to a lot of
people all right so I already gave my
reactions to that and it's actually over
to my left right here where Samsung is
kicking it right now but over to my
right is oculus touch now if you
remember back at MWC this year we were
all really blown away by the HTC vive
which is through the partnership with
valve that HTC is bringing VR in their
own way and it was because there was a
lot of touch and the fact that you can
actually walk around in an environment
in order to really be a part of this VR
experience
now what oculus touch does is actually
very much the same thing except there
are a few changes yes you do have the
entire set connected to a computer and
you're seeing me actually Don the whole
thing right now it's gonna go to a
computer it should have a wireless
component to it considering that the
person had to hold the wire while I was
walking around with it and that was the
case for HTC vive as well but what
oculus has done is they've created the
small space that you're able to walk
around in just like in the vibe but now
the inputs are actually geared taught
more towards the gaming aspect it's
because the actual controllers wrap
around the hands and then the circular
areas where the contacts are communicate
with the computer and with the sensors
to give you a one-to-one access to where
your hands are and now this isn't
something that's necessarily new but the
actual controller itself is pretty much
in the shape of a gun so the two demos
that I actually did wear of gunslinger
stuff so the first one that I did was
simply a shooting gallery type kind of
like in the Old West where I had two
pistols and what what happens is on the
bottom portion where your index feet are
rather your middle finger would lie is a
grabbing button which is where you're
going to grab and
interact with a lot of stuff and by
holding that you're holding up the guns
or any of the items that are in the
world
what made this really cool was the
second demo which was called a bullet
train
so essentially you start on a train and
you're given the ability to teleport
this is the way that you're gonna move
around in the world rather than just be
confined to just one particular area
what you do is you hold the a button
which is one of the space buttons on the
top and then you're able to teleport
forward now this is a game by epic so
you can imagine that it was actually
epic because when the train stopped
after I learned how to teleport and pick
up guns and shoot them I was put into
this train terminal or train station
where all of these soldiers were coming
after me and you're able to teleport to
a bunch of different places grab a bunch
of guns and shoot a lot of people and it
was really awesome see what was really
great about it is that you can teleport
all over the place you're able to even
teleport to your enemies and be able to
disarm them and when he disarmed them
they automatically disappear and died
and whatnot and you had rifles and
shotguns and pistols and they were just
it was just really really fun for
anybody that was the has played
first-person shooters or anything this
really puts you in the shoes of the
character that you're usually playing in
games like that so it was a great demo
showing the capabilities of their touch
platform obviously they're going to be
two controllers but the reason why it's
actually really fun especially for the
gamer types is that they actually have
inputs that cater to gaming but that's
not really all that they have the were
workshop in toy box type games where you
actually put into a space and you have
to grab and actually manipulate parts of
the world so there was that aspect as
well but the games that I played were of
course the shooting gallery types and
the bullet train one which is the one
that came after that a super fun a
really great way for oculus to kind of
put their touch platform forward and to
be able to compete with the likes of HTC
vive with the way that they were able to
show their movements and also their
interactions with the world those
particular types tend to have wands kind
of like the PlayStation Move and whatnot
but the way that oculus is doing it does
seem a bit more intuitive and allows you
a lot of different inputs and movements
because there were control sticks on the
actual controllers so you feasibly you
should be able to move around the world
it might be a little bit weird because
you're in a small Square area
but nonetheless there's a lot of input
on there for you to be able to really
manipulate so that was just a reaction
video it's kind of hard to really show
via our platforms on a video like this
which makes our job a little bit tougher
so the best we can do are these reaction
videos and I wasn't even able to record
the TV that was showing what I was doing
in the VR thing unfortunately but
hopefully you get an idea of just how
cool VR is continuously getting now much
more advanced it's getting as well and
with HTC vive stealing the show back at
MWC oculus is able to steal their show
obviously into their show with their
rift and touch platform so key between
234 even more don't forget to check out
the gear VR video that I did just just a
little while ago then you're probably
seeing on the channel right now so you
can see what Samsung had in store for
this oculus event keep it tuned to you
for even more because we are your source
