reporting live from the Sony booth here
we have the privilege of taking a closer
look at some really really great phones
here the galaxy s3 versus the Sony
experience ZL now this actually is the
device that is packing the largest
display of 5-inch 1080p display with a
Bravia Engine 2 in the smallest form
factor the gentleman who works here he
says that it consumes over 75% of the
entire form factor we're looking at a
front-facing camera on here too which is
interesting they were saying that most
people video chats and whatnot they tend
to have their face down on the bottom so
their engineers actually discover that
people were always looking at the bottom
so we sort of simulate more eye contact
which is a very thoughtful feature
additional differences includes the fact
that it's actually a smaller device but
it has a bigger display now unlike the
Xperia Z this one is not water resistant
but that's ok still the 13 megapixel
Exmor R vs samsung galaxy s 3 s 8
megapixel so the experience e wins zeal
wins there
expandable memory as well different
display technologies completely we're
looking an AMOLED display made by
samsung here versus Sony's in-house LCD
it is also featuring a tempered glass
but it is not of the AMOLED variety like
Samsung gonna be packin LTE connectivity
out of the box when it's launched no
we're done release date or pricing yet
but it has the quad-core Qualcomm s4 pro
processor versus Samson's Exynos and the
processing that's featured in the Xperia
Z L is actually going to be a whole
generation ahead over the arm cortex a9
technology that Samsung is using and the
fact it has more RAM a bigger display a
high-resolution display and also much
better camera means that is likely to be
the better device plus it also has what
a lot of guys have been missing which is
a dedicated camera button so we really
have to hand it to Sony this is actually
probably gonna be my favorite mobile
device that we've seen here at CES 2013
so yeah we just want to take a closer
look for you guys this is a versus of
the Samsung Galaxy s3
versus the Xperia Z L let us know which
one you think is better and don't forget
