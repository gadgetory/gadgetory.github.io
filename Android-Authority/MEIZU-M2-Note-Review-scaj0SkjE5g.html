OneNote launched meizu is back at it
again with the m2 note with very similar
hardware is the meizu m2 note a worthy
refresh this is Bailey Stein with
Android authority and this is why for
review of the meizu m2 note the m2 nose
design is very similar to that of the m1
note with a few seemingly minor changes
it still looks like a larger curved
iPhone 5c and that's especially apparent
when looking at the color options mazes
inspiration from Apple doesn't translate
to a bad design by any means however the
curved polycarbonate unibody design
helps the phone fit nicely in the hand
the camera is flush with the back of the
phone Bunz are responsive and the phone
feels very solid overall although mazes
mentality towards the m2 notes design
could be described as if it ain't broke
don't fix it there are a couple of
notable changes the first being the
shape of the phone the curve isn't as
harsh as it is on the m1 note which
makes the sides easier to grip while
holding the phone secondly the power
button has moved from the
difficult-to-reach top right of the
device to the left side below the nail
volume rocker if you're still not a fan
of the button placement you can always
use the number of unlock gestures or the
physical home button to wake the device
the physical home button is actually the
third and for me largest change that
Mizzou has made with the m2 note the new
button no longer glows and consequently
no longer functions as a notification
LED but it's much better for
navigational purposes why well it not
only functions as a home button but also
as a back pine that's important because
on the m1 note Flemmi added an
additional navigation bar for the back
key a poor implementation to say the
least
the swipe up to access the recent app
tray gesture is still present but I
think that the gesture still ties in
well with the experience unlike an
amazing mx-5 the home button sadly does
not function as a fingerprint reader
meizu did add a traditional notification
LED though to the left of the earpiece
and five megapixel front facing camera
the 5.5 inch 1080p sharp IGZO display on
the m2 note is beautiful it's very
similar to that of the m1 else display
except with more vivid colors and a
slightly warmer color temperature
it's fully laminated coated in Corning
Gorilla Glass 3 has excellent viewing
angles and looks great outdoors the
brightness range is also pretty good and
the adaptive brightness is responsive to
environmental changes it's the best
smartphone display I've seen for under
$200 and it makes media consumption a
very enjoyable experience this time
around Mesa was offering a system
setting to adjust the color temperature
something that some users will
definitely appreciate powering the m2
note is the octa-core 64-bit mediatek
mt6752 collect it 1.3 gigahertz what
size that the processor is actually
slower than the slightly older mt6752
used in the m1 note which is also an
active core 64-bit chip except that it's
clocked at 1.7 gigahertz this makes the
phone feel slower than the m1 note and
the benchmark scores are about 25% less
than they are on the f1 note dated a
performance is still good but that is
good as some other phones in the same
price category including the m1 note
there's also still two gigabytes of RAM
which should be enough for most users
the mali t 7 20 g pu is also a slight
step back from the mali t760 but it
should be able to play most games
without any serious issues the meizu m2
note supports 802 11 and Wi-Fi GPS and
Bluetooth 4.0 the GPS signal could be a
bit stronger but it's much better than
it was on the m1 note and should work
while using the phone outdoors unlike
its older brother the m2 note supports
quad-band WCDMA as well as FDD LTE and
TD LTE unfortunately it only works with
up to HSPA+ on AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile but
speeds do seem to be pretty good at
least an 80 in the Detroit area the side
firing speaker sounds exactly like it
does on the m1 note fairly loud but
distorted at full volume it's
unfortunately very easy to cover the
speaker while holding the phone that's
really the case with any phone with side
firing audio
there is an internal 30 100 milliamp
hour battery which in my testing lasted
through a full day of heavy use I
started my day at about 9 a.m. with
brightness set to auto and Wi-Fi off for
most of the day I took a bunch of
pictures and also use GPS for about 20
minutes the phone lasted until about 11
p.m. with just over 4 hours of screen on
time I think that's pretty good
considering that particular day's usage
the 13 megapixel samsung rear camera
captured some good images and some
not-so-good images it's really just kind
of average at this price point images
seem to have good color reproduction and
detail but it does have some exposure
issues tapping a light object can result
in images that are too dark and vice
versa the camera app does provide a
respectable amount of control and manual
mode and the auto mode is fairly easy to
use the maze um - no chips with fly me
four point five point one a forked
version of android 5.1 lollipop flammie
does get a lot of things right but it
also has a few flaws I'll start with a
list of the positives the gesture wake
up settings are great letter gestures
can be customized on the phone execute
gestures very quickly I like how you can
choose which jets you want to launch
when swiping left or right of a
lockscreen the custom icons used for fly
these launcher are actually pretty good
you can always turn them off in the
settings the system apps are all
beautifully designed the music app has a
large collection of free to stream music
and the tips app is very informative
Smart Touch is kind of cool
they included power saving modes go
beyond what is offered in stock Android
and the Flyleaf 4.2 cruiser bug has been
fixed in 4.5 finally the animations
throughout the operating system despite
digging some obvious inspiration from a
certain fruity tech company are
consistent and provide a very nice
visual experience now to the negatives
the lockscreen doesn't display your
notifications the launcher does not
include an app drawer and the phone
ships with a bunch of useless Chinese
apps which thankfully can be uninstalled
the notification tray still lacks a
setting shortcut so if you want to
access the settings you have to go home
first and then find
Settings app the Settings app itself is
a very watered down version compared to
stock Android and the pre-installed
keyboard isn't very good for English
users unfortunately many apps and
features require you to either speak
Chinese or live in China you can't buy
any music subscriptions apps or themes
and the voice assistant and dry mode are
both limited to the Chinese language
there's also a lack of Google Play
services out of the box some retailers
will install these services for you but
if you perform a factory reset you'll
likely lose them fortunately there are a
few Google installer apps available in
the meizu App Center
but even after running the Google app
does not work at least for me that means
that I wasn't able to use Google now nor
able to use voice for any sort of text
input I realized that the phone wasn't
intended for markets outside of China
but I think that means it could have at
least made the experience better for non
Chinese speaking users the meizu m2 note
is available through many online
third-party resellers starting at about
$160 color options include white grey
blue and pink
there are 16 and 32 gigabyte variants
but if that's not enough you can always
expand it using a microSD card up to 128
gigabytes just keep in mind that you're
going to lose one of the sim slots if
you choose to do so
the meizu m2 note is a great phone which
improves on the already solid at one
note although mezuzah update comes just
months after the initial release of the
m1 note the changes made in the m2 note
are relatively minor it should not upset
on one note users the m2 note is really
just a slightly better version of the m1
note with more refined edges with a
comfortable design excellent display and
great battery life
the m2 note signed in areas where most
other budget devices don't that's not to
say it's without its flaws however as
the performance is disappointing the
camera is still about average and the
fly meself per experience could be
better for non Chinese users if you can
deal with its software quirks the meizu
m2 note is an excellent choice for under
$200 thank you for watching this video
