is Jace I'm sorry I missed last week I
was moving but I'm all in now and you
know what I find interesting it's that
all the news or rumors and leaks
surrounding the galaxy note 4 get far
more attention and search demand then
the supposed real news of the galaxy
alpha does that say more about us andhra
geeks or more about the hopeful iphone
killer that is the Galaxy alpha things
that make you go alright so please
kindly take a big spoonful of salt while
we dig into the galaxy note 4 leaks and
rumors the most obvious feature is the
metallic looking frame going around the
sides of the phone which is very similar
to the frame of the galaxy alpha the
frame is chamfered on the edges and
features would appear to be plastic
inserts ostensibly to ensure antenna
reception the bottom edge of the phone
shows a micro USB 3.0 port a speaker
grill and the s-pen slot on the front
side the only distinctive feature are
the very thin bezels rumor has it that
the note 4 will feature a 5.7 inch 2560
x 1440 pixel AMOLED display the back of
the phone is likely textured plastic
similar to the note 3 but without the
faux stitching the squirt off camera and
LED heart rate sensor module are also
similar to those we saw on the Galaxy
alpha shots now my question for all you
phablet fans out there is how big is too
big at five point seven inches that's a
pretty big phone at what point does it
just become too unruly to be a phone and
just a smaller tablet now I know a lot
of you were really excited about what
the Tegra k1 processor could do but now
NVIDIA has come out with a 64-bit
version titled Denver which simply means
it was specially designed to play john
denver songs
denver in invidious words is the 64-bit
Tegra k1 chip that will offer pc class
performance equipped mobile devices will
experience much better performance for
standard apps extended battery life and
the best web browsing experience while
opening up new possibilities for gaming
enterprise apps and more now with that
being said we are very excited to learn
that this is the expected chipset for
the upcoming nexus 8 and if this all
comes together the 8 inch device will
come with 4 gigabytes of RAM and this
monster of a 64-bit processor sounds
very tempting indeed now moving on news
about the official galaxy alpha or what
samsung hopes will be referred to as the
official iphone killer most of the
specifications of the galaxy alpha have
leaked over the past couple of weeks so
there's no surprise here you get a 4.7
inch HD display an octa-core Exynos
processor two gigabytes of ram 32
gigabytes of storage non-expandable
however and a 12 megapixel rear facing
camera LTE category 6 and in 1860
milliamp hour battery the real store
however is the design to the phone which
incorporates a metal frame going around
the edges of the Alpha the back is still
made of plastic however and features a
variation of the dimpled texture we're
all familiar with from the galaxy s5 the
Galaxy alpha will be available in 5
color options at launch charcoal black
dazzling white frosted gold sleek silver
and scuba blue availability for color
options will vary by market so yes this
looks like a mid-range to upper
mid-range phone and although it does not
have a micro SD card slot for expandable
storage it does have a removable battery
always good news alright thanks for
watching android army my name is Jace
love to connect with you right here on
google+ or twitter now you should know
there's been on ongoing contest on the
android Q&amp;amp;A series i have some clues put
into those shows you should watch them
if you can find the clues you reach the
prize of a fifty-dollar google play gift
card that's been ongoing it's been
really hard for people to find these
clues my other clues in the past we're
clearly too easy
they're hard I spent almost as much time
trying to choose those clues as I didn't
actually editing the video so check
those out they'll be two more coming out
over the next couple of weeks I'm going
on vacation this week but an Android Q&amp;amp;A
will be coming out as soon as I get back
go to forget about my brother's Android
Josh Joe and the tech ninja Kevin Chris
and lon always working hard to deliver
the best content on the web I should see
you next week on Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
