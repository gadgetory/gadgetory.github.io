really thin device one of the thinnest
on the mark well not yet on the market
but it's only six point nine millimeters
thin but it's special because it
contains Intel's latest clover trail and
is reputed to be extremely powerful so
let's just do a test and see how it
fares
I can feel like heating up now just to
the top right
now this is only a prototype mind you so
it might not be the most optimized but
we'll get a sense of its raw performance
here it was a little bit sluggish but
that could just be too due to the fact
that the UI and overlay is not optimized
yet
five point five inch display clocked at
two gigahertz with two gigs of RAM it's
got a 13 megapixel with a 1.8 1.8 focal
length dual LED flash it's got a 2
megapixel on the front it's a really
strong angular eyes sort of industrial
type design just bear with us guys only
27% here and we did some testing on the
snapdragon 600 reese previously and that
had phenomenal benchmarks putting it
really to the top of the charts it
likely is the most powerful SOC in the
world before the 800 comes out we didn't
get a chance to test the tiger 4 yet but
it will likely be quick very powerful
too
and for those of you that are bored you
can just skip ahead this is the latest
version 9 to 2 we just have to install
it I hope you all appreciate how
difficult it is to get Wi-Fi or any
radio signal in a room where there's
about a thousand people all competing
for a signal and if you're still
watching and you haven't skip forward
you are a patient person
I mean really patient it's pretty warm
in the back here actually it feels quite
warm here yeah it's definitely stepping
up here we go ninety-three percent we
are so close the moment of truth is upon
us
I feel like an NFL announcer here we go
100% 100% this version 3.1 point 1 &amp;amp; 2 2
now there are a lot of peers out there
that will Wow higher than the Snapdragon
600 we saw on the Optimus G pro that is
the nominal that's unbelievable so as
you can see yeah I mean I don't know
what to say I know it's getting a little
it probably just sucked away at all from
that test there might not be the highest
in the world we have some modified
devices here obviously a little bit
overclocked and tweaked
not to mention guys this is a 1920 by
1080 display running Android 4.2.1 out
of the box it is besting the HTC One
which is a Snapdragon 600 so in all
likelihood what we're looking at here is
an extremely powerful device until
they're targeting what appears to be the
low-end segment and they're
collaborating with a few device
manufacturers but those numbers speak
for themselves number 5 not bad up
against some really really impressive
company here obviously we're gonna have
to do a lot more thorough testing once
we got one of these guys in so I know
that ok dude there we go
so I think I speaks to herself so guys
this is a first look at the benchmarks
in the k900 from Lenovo running a two
gigahertz Intel cloverfield it's really
impressive stay tuned to android
authority your source for all things
Android my name is Darcy Lou cuvee we're
live on the ground here at Mobile World
Congress Barcelona 2013 let us know what
you think of this processor the k900 and
