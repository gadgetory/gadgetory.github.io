render of the Samsung Galaxy s8 but
we're aware is the fingerprint sensor a
3d render video from on lakes might give
us the best look at the Samsung Galaxy
s8 and s8 plus design unli exclaims this
render is based on a factory
computer-aided design of the devices and
could tell us a lot about the upcoming
flagships as you can see in the video
the s8 seems to have a significant
screen to body ratio reportedly around
90% and will lack the physical home
button typically found in the Galaxy S
series you may also notice what appears
to be a lock button on either side of
the device one of these could represent
a dedicated Bigsby virtual assistant
button that has also been rumored other
details include the single button
mounted speaker USB type-c connection
and the inclusion of a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack many feared will be lost
in an attempt to mirror Apple's iPhone 7
now check this out if this render is
accurate and there indeed is no physical
home button and presumably there's no
kind of on-screen home button then the
fingerprint sensor has to be on the side
or the back we don't see anything on the
side and look right under the camera
there's no fingerprint sensor there are
nothing that looks like a fingerprint
sensor it looks like it could be on the
top right hand corner of the phone just
to the right of the camera that's gonna
be kind of awkward especially for those
of you getting the si+ unless you have
some creepy long scary fingers it's
gonna be really hard to get to you
one-handed what do you guys think are
you concerned let me know in the
comments below all right now let's talk
snapchat and I know I know many of you
are not a big fan of snapshots Android
app and I hear you I read in the
comments on Sunday however this is
important because snapchat is massively
influential and yet they are bleeding
money so an attempt to make more money
snapchat has made a deal to publish the
planet Earth miniseries exclusively
on snapchat snap ink and BBC Worldwide
are releasing six brand-new mini
episodes of planet Earth two exclusively
on snapchat each episode will last
between four and six minutes with the
first launching on February 17th a day
before the planet Earth two series
debuts in the u.s. it was shown in the
UK towards the end of last year the
episodes will be released on a weekly
basis and will align with the locations
of the TV series mountains deserts
jungles Islands grasslands and cities
but will feature all new footage built
for snapchats portrait mobile view
unlike the TV show these episodes won't
be narrated by Sir David Attenborough
but instead by British actress Sophie
Okonedo think The Secret Life of Bees
and Hotel Rwanda and know this
miniseries will not be available in 4k
but dude it's on your phone okay you
know what sometimes a comment can be
repeated enough times or thumbed up
enough times that the average casual
viewer starts to believe it even though
it is verifiably false proven in the
video that they just watched yeah so I
thought it was time that we have a
little post show chat like we used to
have and clarify some things one I will
talk about politics when it is relevant
to tackle the Trump immigration ban and
how it affects the tech world is
obviously related to tack it has a
profound impact on the tech world it is
relevant I will talk about it
if you don't like that okay I understand
that that's fine you can unsubscribe no
problem
second thing is that people were saying
that I said that Saudi Arabia and Egypt
were responsible for 9/11
holy crap people listen to what was just
said nothing in that video suggested
those two things at all I did say that
some of the 9/11 attack errs were from
those countries and Trump didn't ban
those countries why he didn't explain
that the media has not explained that
I'm still asking the question so if we
want to have great conversations of the
comments please make intelligent
comments based on what was actually
talked about in the show and if you
disagree that's okay that's good explain
to me educate me instead of calling me a
stupid Lib tard
