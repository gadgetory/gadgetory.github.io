si+ have been out for a little while now
and whether you're already own one or
just now considering picking one up I'm
sure some thought has got into how you
can best protect it with so many options
out there when it comes to shielding
this top-end piece of tech finding
something that perfectly suits your
particular needs can be tough
so we've rounded up some of the best
options available for the premium
handset
now we'll be sticking with the five
point eight inch variant in today's
video however all the cases featured are
also available for the s8 plus I'm Mike
for Android authority and these are the
top cases for the galaxy s eight and
that's a plus so starting things off
we'll take a look at two cases from case
ology the légion and parallax series
cases both offer military-grade drop
protection with a dual layer design each
is made up of a rugged yet pliable TPU
interior surrounded by a hard
polycarbonate outer shell the parallax's
shell has more of a bumper style design
that skirts the edges of the SE leaving
the TPU layer and its signature textured
geometric design exposed on the back
while the lijing series has more of a
traditional and sleeker look with the
hard shell covering majority of the
device both cases have fully covered
raised buttons that are easy to press
and have nice tactile feedback cutouts
for the speaker mic charging and audio
ports are spot on and should offer ample
room for a variety of connectors you
also get a nice laying a table design
with each thanks to the top and bottom
TPU being slightly raised from the
display now as far as feeling hand goes
the size of the paralyzed case make it a
little more pump friendly thanks to its
rounded edges and textured TPU while the
légion case has a sleeker more
aggressive angular design which doesn't
feel as quite nice to hold at the end of
the day if you're looking for a case
that's both protective and gets a thumbs
up in the looks department you really
can't go wrong with either of these
options best of all you can pick each of
them up right now for under $15 up next
or two clear case options for those who
are looking to let the beauty of the
rest States design shine through first
up is the affinity case for poetic
now this case brings a truly unique look
with its xform architecture and it's
been engineered to offer optimal shots
of
with minimal bulk the case is made up
with a hard polycarbonate shell that's
infused with molded shock resistant TPU
each corner of the affinity is plated
with this thick CPU which flows down the
back of the case in this rigid stress
dissipating pattern that comes in a few
of the color options such as clear black
and blue
the sides feature fully covered buttons
that offer good feedback and an ansi
slip texture for added grip cut up
surface ice for the charging port
speaker headphone jack as well as the
cameron fingerprint scanner now one of
the nicer touches of the Eternity case
of those raised TPU channels that run
down the back to give you the ability to
slap your phone down without worrying
about scratching up the clear finish and
in addition to the raised bezel on the
front the affinity case really has you
covered regardless of how you want to
lay down your s8 the Infinity case has
been recently heavily discounted and
will run you just 995 making it one of
the more affordable options on the
market and one you just might want to
pick up the second clear case we're
taking a look at today is the ring key
fusion this case should appeal to those
who enjoy a minimalist design without
sacrificing protection like many other
cases the fusion is just that the fusion
of a polycarbonate back plate with the
soft TPU bumper that's aimed at letting
the look of your s8 speak for itself
taking an up-close look at the back of
the case you'll notice two slightly
raised corners with a TPU tapers off and
sticks out just a bit it's a subtle
addition but one that makes the back of
the case much less prone to scratching
the sides of the case is soft as are the
covered buttons which still provide nice
click and feedback the cutouts are ample
and allow for easy access to all ports
as well as a fingerprint scanner the
ring key Fusion is available for just
1199 in addition to the clear comes in
two other color options rose gold
crystal and smoke black so if you're
looking for a slim and lightweight clear
case for your SH definitely check this
guy out
ok so I think we can all agree the s8 is
a marvel of design and a beautiful piece
of tech so it's understandable that some
of you wouldn't want to cover it up with
a case at all and if a clear case is in
your bag but you still feel the need to
protect your investment you might want
to check out this next occasion the
crash guard from Rhino shield is a
simple bumper style case that offers
some of the best draw protection you can
find it's comprised of both hard and
soft polycarbonate which covers just the
size of your device allowing me to show
off the s8 in almost all let's go
the case is surprisingly comfortable to
hold most bumper style cases protrude
out from the edges for added protection
but make holding the device a bit
awkward the crash guard doesn't suffer
from this as a tapers down on the left
and right sides almost flush with the
back of the phone top and bottom bezels
are bit thicker which provide protection
for the corners as well as elevating the
SI toes buy any flat surface the case
has a matte finish where at a grip and
cutout slope for plenty of room your
power volume and Dixie buttons are
covered and easy to press though they do
feel a bit mushy and lack that
satisfying click that some other cases
also but hands down the cases to win the
level of jaw protection you're getting
and the fact that the majority of the
phone is uncovered as intended makes the
crash cart from rhino shield a solid
option for anyone moving on we have a
few cases from spigen the rugged orange
tough armor and Neo Hybrid are always a
top speed means annual lineup of cases
and this year for the s8 is no exception
like the cases we took a look at from
case ecology the tough armor new hybrid
of both dual layer designs with distinct
variations the tough armor is the
Kangaroos begins lineup when it comes to
draw protection comprised of a hard
polycarbonate shell surrounding a
durable TPU inner layer and using
speakings air cushion technology the
tough armor provides military great job
protection and features an angular
industrial design fully covered buttons
sit flush the profile of the case and
have good tactile feedback the big speed
button is easy to find if you ever
wanted to thanks to the ribbed texture
that's been added cutouts of precise as
always and the inclusion of a kickstand
is always convenient for viewing media
the tough armor is available in the
black you see here as well as gunmetal
coral blue and maple gold and pricing
ranges from 14 to $17.99 the Neo Hybrid
is an attractive yet protective case
constructed of a bumper style frame made
of hard polycarbonate
versus a fullback plates a little tough
armor it has the same military grade
certification against drops and dings
and features a laser cut pattern let's
edge into the TPU for added grip it
offers a lie in the table design with
slightly raised top and bottom bezels
raised buttons are very responsive and
cut out to precise for all ports the
camera modular fingerprint scanner were
trimmed it is glossy hard TC same as on
the tough armor for
detection over all the Neo Hybrid slim
profile and slick styling with its
rounded edges and herringbone pattern
back make it the top selling case with
vegans lineup it would be a great choice
for anyone who regards and looks as
highly as protection because here you
get both the last case where spigen is
the rugged armor it's a simple single
layer TPU case but as with the last two
options the corners of the case you
speak into air cushion technology so it
still provides that military-grade
detection this slim and flexible case
which snug and feels great in the hand
thanks to the unique fingerprint
resistant finish and the carbon-fiber
accents give it a premium look the
buttons respond to the light press and
offer solid feedback and cutouts are
perfectly aligned and should provide
plenty of room for most 3.5 millimeter
connections the rugged armor is a
lightweight great feeling case that will
only set you back $9.99 making it
another excellent option the Tauri
wallet case is a nice all-in-one option
it has a premium leather exterior and
uses a TPU shell to keep your SAT firmly
in place the interior is outfitted with
three card slots and a larger pocket to
hold your cash the magnetic clasp keeps
your cover from opening and allows for
quick and easy access it's actually
quite strong giving the case a better
chance of staying close if dropped the
case can also be used as a kickstand for
viewing media cutouts are precise and
offer plenty of room to access your
charging port headphone jack and speaker
the cutout on the back is a little
cramped but the fingerprint scanner is
still accessible the Tauri wallet case
does a good job of guarding your s8
against dirt dust and scratches if
thrown into a backpack of bag it's
definitely not the slimmest option even
as far as folio style cases go but the
added convenience it brings along with
its elegant look makes the case a nice
addition for anyone looking for an
all-in-one solution for their everyday
carry moving on from the more elaborate
to the most minimal and the thickest of
the thinnest the minimal case for the
Galaxy s8 is at the opposite end of the
spectrum at just point three five
millimeters the cases as slim as it gets
the shell has no branding of any kind
and is finished with a fine matte
texture that does a great job of
repelling fingerprints exposed buttons
ensure easy access as they extend just
past the case on the back individual
cutouts mean you don't have to hunt for
the fingerprint scanner as much and the
raised lip around the camera module
prevents scratches to the lens
the whole idea here is that this is an
option for those who really don't want
to be using a case at all but still load
the thought of scratching up the finish
of their beautiful new phone and unlike
a skin this can be reused time and time
again there's nothing quite like the
feel of the s8 in your hands and the
minimal case gives you the ability to
retain that feel while offering some
added protection the case comes in five
color barriers including clear white
clear black solid black coral blue and
red and can be picked up for $14.99 the
last two cases on the list put
protection above all else the poetic
revolution and diesel bold are two of
the most solid build cases we could find
and are designed to provide all-around
protection in almost any environment the
poetic revolution is a rugged two-piece
case that combines a super stick TPU
exterior along with a hard polycarbonate
inner frame to shield your se it
features a textured and fingerprint
finish for added grip fully covered TPU
buttons and flaps that protect your
charging port and headphone jack from
dirt dust and debris the inner frame
locks your s8 in the event of a fall and
the raised corners or for additional
shock protection now installation and
removal isn't the easiest but that's par
for the course with a case like this
it's also worth noting that full
coverage glass screen protectors won't
work on this case it's a polycarbonate
frame laying over top of the display
overall the poetic revolution is a solid
choice if you're in the market for a
rugged case and that extra bit of added
protection finally last up is easel bolt
leave the bolt offers everything in
expect from a rugged smartphone case
including multi-layered military-grade
drop protection with its TPU and impact
resistant polycarbonate its unique
styling is said to be engineered for the
best possible user experience it
features a perforated outer shell with
molded story Asian's that provide added
grip and is coated with a soft touch
finish and now tower locking kickstand
over its hands for reviewing and covered
buttons keep out unwanted dirt and dust
the case comes with a digital
accessories like a screen protector
rotatable belt clip holster and a
lanyard to further aid in your active
lifestyle disease will bolt is a stylish
and protective case built with
thoughtful design it is available in a
slew of color combinations currently
priced at just $12.99 and is definitely
worth a look if you're interested in top
airline protection
well that's just about wraps it up for
this one guys I hope you all enjoyed the
video and until next time I'm Mike
LeBron Oh for Android Authority and this
has been the top cases for the galaxy s
8 and s 8 plus thanks for watching
