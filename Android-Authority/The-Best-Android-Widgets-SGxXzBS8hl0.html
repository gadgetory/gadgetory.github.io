Joe handy the Android authority app guy
do you like widgets I know I do and
after the intro we'll take a look at
some of the best widgets for Android
first on our list today is battery
widget reborn this simple and wonderful
battery widget is pretty much everything
you want in well a battery widget aside
from displaying the battery the widget
can be used as a toggle to turn anything
you like on and off it also happens to
be fairly customizable you could change
the color of any part of it and the
widget can be resized to any size so if
you're looking for a 2 by 2 green and
black battery widget it's doable if
you're looking for a 5 by 5 purple and
yellow widget go for it next up is clock
now this very simple widget is a clock
widget in the style of the popular
google now card so if you're going for
that authentic Google look you can now
do that there are four background
options and two text color options so
there's even a little customization
there along with the clock you can have
it show with weather and an icon of your
choice that icon will have to say single
toggle so if you talk about your Wi-Fi a
lot you can do that the app also comes
with a dedicated toggle widget with up
to 6 toggle spaces in case you need one
of those digital calendar and widget is
not just an awesome widget but it's a
pretty good app too many stock and OAM
skin calendar offerings are okay but
they may be lacking some things like a
good widget offering this is where
digital excels because it has some
really great widget offerings you can
choose from a lot of styles do you want
a full screen month view digital has it
you want a 2 by 4 widget that shows day
by day it can do that to pretty much any
permutation of a calendar widget that
you can think of is present it's neutral
colored so it works all with any theme
and you can control the transparency one
of the most popular and highly rated set
of widgets is HD widgets there are two
reasons for this first there is a truly
wide selection of widget configurations
toggles clocks weather and calendar
widgets and many of them can be combined
the second is customization each widget
can be customized in a variety of ways
you can choose text color background
color clock color and with their color
for map you can customize it even more
so anyone with any theme can choose
something in HD widgets that works for
them last on our list is tap too you may
recall that this app also made it onto
our best google reader replacement apps
list and it appears here again in the
best widget list tap 2 has a couple of
really nice widgets that you can use to
keep track of your news
first option is a scrollable wedgie that
works rather well if your phone Hardware
can't handle that there is a less
resource-intensive card widget they can
be customized to show a certain new
stream and you can change things like
style and colors in terms of news
widgets it's one of the best if you take
a look at our leaderboard you can see
how these apps stack up against one
another as usual this is based on the
Google Play Store ratings and there is
no bias on our part to download these
apps you can find links in the video
description this was a difficult list to
compile as it's difficult to gauge the
value of a widget tap su has some great
widgets but may be useless for those who
don't use their devices for news feeds
so we've included some honorary mentions
these include UC CW beautiful widgets
battery monitor widget resizable contact
widget pro and minimalistic text because
there are just so many widgets that do
so many things this list may not contain
all of the widgets that you love so if
there's one you'd like to give a shout
out to feel free to leave a comment and
let us know once again i'm joe hindi the
android authority app guy feel free to
subscribe to our youtube channel and
check out our social media links in the
video description</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
