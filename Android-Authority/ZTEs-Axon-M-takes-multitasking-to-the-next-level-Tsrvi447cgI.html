landscape has only one note and that
note is square monochrome and 18 by 9
let's face it it's been more than a
decade since we last saw smartphones
seriously innovate there's a
tried-and-true rectangular formula and
everyone is sticking to it but it's 2017
now and people are starting to look for
a change
while some manufacturers are leaning on
gimmicks like mods looking at you
motorola and LG other brands are trying
to seriously push the envelope in terms
of what we expect from our daily devices
both Lenovo and Samsung have been
famously playing with foldable devices
but the first one out of the gate in
that regard has been CTE the ZTE axon M
represents finally true innovation in
the handset sphere it's genuinely unlike
anything we've seen before offering two
screens for the price of one with a
simple robust hinge that opens the door
to a whole new world of possibilities
what makes the axon M stand out we've
seen a lot of interesting concept
designs from a variety of brands but ZTE
is the first to bring something truly
different to the commercial market the
excellent M isn't the first phone to
offer two screens but it is the first
phone to offer two screens right while
the dual screen phone market is very
much in its infancy the axon M is for
the trendsetter someone who wants a
phone that stands out and isn't another
v2 device this is a smarter smartphone
thanks to the new multitasking features
that just aren't possible with two other
smart phones the axon M s unique display
setup opens up the floodgates for
developers on a whole new level the
possibilities with this true dual screen
are unlimited and developers are
springing to action to craft creative
new interfaces to match it's certainly
an early adopters device for those who
are ready for something new to finally
arrive not only is the axon M
stimulating developing corner of the
world it's also causing case makers to
turn an interested eye the future of
mobile tech will not be limited by a
single 18 by 9 screen and case makers
will need to adapt to fit the axon M is
a harbinger of a completely novel mobile
landscape why two screens multitasking
has long been a pain for all mobile
devices many software innovations such
as split screen have been dedicated to
solving this issue however nothing can
quite make up for the sheer power of
added display real estate the axon M
dual screen setup allows you to run two
apps simultaneously in their full States
watch videos while
taking notes keep texting while browsing
the right thread you've been perusing or
look at two different cat photos at the
same time the world is your oyster
it's a standout device that's sure to
turn heads around anyone who uses it far
from a me-too gimmick the axe on em is a
genuine innovation that offers practical
utility alongside eye snagging design
it's advice for the working man that can
handle multitasking with aplomb and
entertainment would seal the ability to
fold out the phone into tablet sized
screen space is an additional advantage
that no previous device has been able to
claim tablets in general suffered an
initial rise in prominence followed by a
fall and use largely due to their non
mobile size however with the ax on em
you're able to carry all the screen size
of a tablet right in your pocket ZTE has
worked with a variety of designers to
custom fit this tablet experience and
it's even possible to extend displays
across screens on apps that weren't
specifically designed to do so the
devices software is just as flexible as
its hardware the ax on em is advice
truly willing to bend over backwards to
get what you need the ax on em is a
first generation product that offers a
ton of great features right out of the
gate
however as developer interest increases
owners will be able to do more and more
with their ax on em it's totally
possible for one screen to operate as a
controller while another works as a
console emulator offering unprecedented
mobile gaming potential it can function
as an e-book with pages displayed on
either side the only limit to the
feature of dual screens is our
collaborative imagination if you're
interested in getting in on the future
of smartphone tech the ZTE axon M is
exclusively available on AT&amp;amp;T and is
also available for purchase at Best Buy
locations as well follow the links in
