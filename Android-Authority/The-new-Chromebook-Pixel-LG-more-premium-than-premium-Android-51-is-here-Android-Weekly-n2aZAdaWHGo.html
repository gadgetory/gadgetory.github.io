brought to you by domain.com hey
everybody this is Jace ok hello again
ladies and gentlemen I'm Joe Hindy from
android authority chase is out on
vacation this week so I'm going to be
filling in for him let's take a look at
this week's Android news the big news of
the week was the rollout of android 5.1
lollipop it came with dual-sim support a
few UI tweaks device protection HD
calling and according to the changelog
over 14,000 total under the hood changes
the device protection is a particularly
interesting feature that will keep your
phone lock down even after it has been
factory reset of course that
functionality is only on the Nexus 6 and
the Nexus 9 right now but more devices
will have it eventually unfortunately
we're not sure if the memory leak bug
has been fixed some have reported that
it has been while others have posted to
the google code form to let them know
that they're still experienced some
memory issues nevertheless the update
has been deemed a big success over
android 5.0 you're wondering when it
will reach your Nexus device the answer
is soon there are factory images
available for the Nexus 5 nexus 7 2013
and the Nexus 10 and it's even begun
rolling out to some Nexus 5 and Nexus 6
owners if you don't have it yet patience
because it's coming soon if you don't
own a Nexus device we have no idea when
it's coming to you this samsung galaxy
s6 remains a top story in the news this
last week after a report came out that
stated that Samsung already received 20
million pre-orders for the galaxy s6 and
s6 edge I mean it kind of makes sense
that interest is that high even after
Mobile World Congress opinions of
Samsung's flagship has been generally
positive a few people don't like the
lack of SD card and removable battery
but generally speaking people think this
galaxy s lineup is way better than years
past of course it helps a lot when
reports like this one from display may
come out that declare the samsung galaxy
s6 and s6 edge have the best screens in
the industry right now based on a
variety of tests including color
accuracy brightness and energy
consumption in response to all of this
hype Samsung is ramping up production
which could be a great move if the phone
really is going to be that popular or a
seriously bad move if they overestimate
how many they'll need and over produce
like they did with the samsung galaxy s5
of course we'll know for sure after the
devices get released
LG has also been in the news lately
after they announced that they would be
creating a device that was to quote more
premium than premium the announcement
comes hot on the heels of various leaks
and rumors regarding the LG g4 and a
curious device called the LG note which
I'm sure these Samsung lawyers are
already working hard to destroy before
it sees the light of day according to
Juno cho LG mobile CEO we are planning
to release a product that stands above
the g series it will be launched during
the second half of this year what's
interesting about all this is the g
series is already among the best devices
released every year after LG put their
act together with the g series lineup
it's hard to imagine what could be
better than what they've already got in
the pipes rest assured we'll know by
Christmas last up this week let's talk
about the new a Chromebook pixel the
2015 version of the Chromebook flagship
will retail starting at about a thousand
bucks with a more powerful LS version
retailing at thirteen hundred dollars us
the Chromebook pixel will come with an
intel core i5 or i7 between 8 and 16
gigabytes of ram and between 32
gigabytes and 60 gigabytes of storage
depending on which model you pick up it
also comes with a headphone jack a micro
SD card reader and two USB 3.0 HDMI
1,700 pixel touchscreen with a 3-2
aspect ratio fans of the Chromebook or
at least detractors of apple's latest
macbook have already begun spec
comparisons spoiler alert the Chromebook
has better specs by a whole bunch
perhaps the most interesting part of the
Chromebook pixel is the USB type-c after
the announcement the internet flooded
with interest about the USB type-c
google has been working with a USB
implementers forum to create a unique
connector because there isn't a
universal standard for laptop charging
it and this could change all of that
reportedly it can deliver up to 100
watts of power and has adaptive charging
that changes based on what devices
plugged in that means laptops will get
more power and cell phones will get
however much power they need which makes
it truly Universal Adam Rodriguez
product manager at Google is quoted as
saying that Google is very big on the
type-c and that we should expect it in a
lot more Chromebooks and Android phones
