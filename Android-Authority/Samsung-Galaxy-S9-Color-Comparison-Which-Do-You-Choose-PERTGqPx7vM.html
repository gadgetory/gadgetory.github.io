official and as Samsung likes to do
every year they released our phones in
multiple colors so let's take a quick
look at all the color options that you
have for the galaxy s 9 and s 9 plus so
let's start with the most basic color
option and probably the one that you're
going to see the most out of all the
colors I'm talking about none other than
midnight black it's a color that Samsung
has been using for quite some time now
and because it gives you that all
blacked out look it's easily the
stealthiest color you can get it's even
more stealthy looking than the previous
s8 or no date because the metal frame is
now completely matte black whereas
before the frame was a glossy finish I'm
a pretty big fan of the subtle change
and it's a safe color option as you can
never really go wrong with black next up
is lilac purple and every year there's
always at least one color that is the
flashiest and most eye-catching and
lilac purple is the one for this year it
sort of reminds me of the purple LGB 30
with how it has a slightly pinkish look
to it and it's also very vibrant at the
same time it wouldn't necessarily be my
first choice but overall it's a pretty
good-looking color and something that's
a little different from some of the more
standard colors that were typically used
to seeing the third color option that
you're going to have for the galaxy s 9
is coral blue we've seen Samsung use
blue plenty of times with their
smartphones and the shade of blue that
they use seems to change every single
year and the s9 is no exception I would
say that this is a much lighter shade of
blue compared to the blue we saw a few
years ago on the galaxy s6 and it's also
not super vibrant like the deep sea blue
from the note 8 I definitely like the
deep sea blue from the note 8 a lot
better but this is still a pretty
good-looking shade of blue and if you're
a fan of blue I think you'll be pretty
happy with this color last but not least
is titanium gray and out of all the
colors available this one is definitely
my favorite
I like this color because it's sort of a
great in-between option it stands out
much more than the midnight black but it
isn't overly flashy like the lilac
purple and gray and black is a pretty
good-looking color combination in
general unlike the orchid grey that
Samsung used in the past this doesn't
have the hints of purple or anything
like
that it's just a fairly standard shade
of gray the only downside is this color
isn't coming to the US and that always
seems to be the case with every Samsung
release there's always that one color
that doesn't make it and more often than
not it's one of the better colors that
they release I've got my fingers crossed
hoping that this is going to change but
for now this color is going to be pretty
tough to get if you're in the US but
that's pretty much all of the colors for
the samsung galaxy s 9 and s 9 plus let
us know which one is your favorite down
in the comment section below and of
course keep it tuned here for more on
the samsung galaxy s 9 and the rest of
our MWC 2018 coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
