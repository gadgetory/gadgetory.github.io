Android authority what's going on
everybody and here we are with the
zenfone zoom by a soos and you're gonna
notice that I won't have the screen on
here that's because we're actually
working with a mock-up so we can take a
look at the hardware of this device but
there will be some clips being
interspersed in this particular video of
the software that you can see it's just
we couldn't take it off the actual
tether nonetheless I wanted to bring you
my thoughts on the at least the chassis
the design and what has really kind of
turned out to be a very nice feeling
phone despite the fact that on the back
here you're getting a full camera we are
still having the 13 megapixels here on
the rear facing camera and the
front-facing camera is 5 megapixels but
nonetheless it will have a three times
zoom that has a total 12 times total
magnification effect but perhaps even
more importantly than that oh why yes is
available here optical image
stabilization and laser autofocus both
great features that we have seen create
some nice photos and a nice camera
experience on other devices and as far
as the design goes you can really see
here that this is a nice looking camera
already but on the other side it just
happens to be a phone you have the nice
big unit over here with the lens that is
the lens with all of the little parts
over here three times being shown here a
soos right here on the left side and
then the rear-facing camera a
rear-facing speaker I should say but
especially in the hand you do have a
nice and metal feel all around in this
particular sense it does feel very
sturdy and it definitely feels like a
premium device which makes sense too
considering that its price point is
going to be higher than the zenfone 2 's
you can even see this little shine here
on the bottom where you can have this
hairline aluminum feel or metal feel I
should just say right there what was
also interesting here is the fact that
the button layout is just a little bit
different you can have the power button
right here easily accessible with the
thumb and the volume rockers feel really
meaty over on top of it but down here we
have the dedicated shutter button that
is really nice to use and after that a
record button for a video so it's nice
to be able to get straight to recording
video with a dedicated button on there
not something you see all the time with
other smartphone cameras on in this case
a camera smartphone the Asus
phone soom also comes with a 5.5 inch
1080p display covered in Corning Gorilla
Glass 3 and though we don't have the
full spec we do expect this to have the
same type of Intel processor that is
available in the zenfone 2 but now let's
take a look at the Zen UI now one of the
main reasons why we weren't really able
to take the phone off of the tether is
because there are still a couple things
are being worked out in especially the
camera software but you can see that the
Zen UI is largely the same when you look
at this one compared to say the zenfone
2 and one now with all of the new
customization features inside that you
can really make this operating system
your own and going through everything
this is one of the few Asian
manufacturers that puts a app drawer
inside of this nui which is off
obviously going to be great for a lot of
Western users but nonetheless it's a
very good-looking Android iteration with
5.0 lollipop as you can see with the
notification drop-down being the way
that it is and also even the deep recent
apps screen having all of those cards
there but nonetheless this was just a
quick look at these n phones soon we
will obviously get our review unit at
some point later on and be able to put
this thing out for a camera shootout
perhaps up against some of the
competitors that this form-factor agenda
generally tends to sort of take on
nonetheless that is the zenfone zoom and
you can stay tuned to Android 34 all the
best coverage of CES 2015 we're here
with a sous on the floor at CES 2015
make sure you stay tuned here because we
are your source for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
