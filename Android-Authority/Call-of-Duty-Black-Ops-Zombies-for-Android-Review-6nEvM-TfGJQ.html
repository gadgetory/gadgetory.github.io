Clayton Youngberg coming at you from
your number one source for all things
Android Android authority comm C we're
going to be reviewing Activision's brand
new call of duty black ops zombies game
for the Android OS now this has been out
for a while on the other horrid iOS
systems but it's finally come to Android
and Sony has the licensing to this for
about a month so at the time of filming
it's only available on these experiences
I'm running this on my Sony Xperia ion
we've got our 1.5 gigahertz dual-core
snapdragon s3 processor pushing the
graphics behind this awesome game I'm
going to go ahead and see how it goes
this is our main menu starting off our
main user interface we have single
player gaming modes we can choose our
player profiles by some call of duty
points also we have our co-op
multiplayer mode
we've got extras available and then we
can choose more apps by Activision let's
go ahead and check out our extras first
off we have controls configuration
settings we can restore the default
settings view the credits view about the
game and view tutorials check out what's
under settings you have detail level
going to go ahead and turn that all the
way up so we can play this on our expiry
on the look just beautiful and choose
our music volumes a lot of you hardcore
gamers might recognize this of course
it's the same music for the Xbox and we
can enable our sound effects i'll leave
the music on just for novelty and we'll
go back checking out our single player
we'll go ahead and go in there you can
see we can start a new game or we can
continue games that we have previously
saved that's a really cool functionality
I like the ability to save games and to
go ahead and start a new one though give
us a prompt that will be erasing our
previous game now we can choose our
players such as Nikolaj Misaki dr.
Edward Richtofen and tank Dempsey so I'm
going to choose Dempsey then we can
choose our levels we have our tutorial
kino der toten get-ups arcade the
ascension level and then the call of the
Dead director's cut my favorite is
ascension so we're going to go ahead and
play that and then we have our
difficulties recruit regular and veteran
so I'm going to choose recruit for the
sake of the video I am not that good of
a player yet just go ahead and continue
we have our usual loading screen the
same one as on the Xbox
got some nice little hints down here
usually this one says kill yourself with
grenade disappoint so anyways the
graphics are pretty good they're running
pretty well on the Sony Xperia ion here
we do have our 1.5 gigahertz dual-core
processor as you can see the controls
are pretty responsive go ahead and turn
the music down just for a second so we
can get my comment Airy now you guys
just love to hear my voice anyways very
responsive you can move around like this
we have our left stick controlling our
general movement and then our right
stick controls our finer aim you can
simply tap this button to hone in and
then we just tap the screen to shoot
turn it up just you can guys get enough
of the sound effects automatic reload
this is how we stab just press the knife
button got some dropping from the
ceiling let's try the stab one controls
take a little bit getting used to turn
no scope these guys have our classic
quotes tank dempsey oh really nice
gameplay full feature we can get our
prickle colas over here is our quick
revive so we'll go ahead and get that
really quick
good $500 I'll show you what it's like
to get down and the zombies kill me
really quick so I can actually show you
the pre colas do work we have all of
them got the stamina what else is there
PhD flopper available um what else
basically all of them I'm pretty sure
all of them are available I'll let this
guy get me down and we can shoot our I
think they're called the Mustang and
Sally when you get the tool pissed the
dual pistols when you go down see it
takes more hits than in the Xbox game
you get down
there were nice sound effects the
brilliant sound of having your ears
green when an explosive goes off feet in
front of you um so anyways let's go
ahead and go through the full level
really quick I don't think I have enough
money to open the doors just yet but we
will try it yeah getting lost here
anyways it is running very smoothly
we'll go ahead and go back we can save
and quit here go back into our main menu
show you just a few more of the features
and then you guys should try it out
yourselves if you do have an expiry
advice it's going to be coming to all of
the devices not just the Sony devices
here very quickly just for about a month
Sony has the licensing on it let's try
our co-op multiplayer and see how this
goes we have our local Wi-Fi connection
we can play online with our buddies
don't have any friends right now who
have a Sony device so I am Sol on that
check out our buying the Tod points we
can buy these points and let's see what
we can do with these points we can use
them for new weapons perks and new areas
and we can also use them and buy from
the main menu or in-game or
single-player use only so that's pretty
cool it's got a great interface umm it's
heavily developed really fun to play
check it out for your Sony devices you
guys it's just a blast if you love the
Xbox game you're gonna love the mobile
version $7 in the Play Store so it's got
a somewhat heavy price tag but not that
bad
I'd suggest getting it if you're a Call
of Duty fan and thanks for watching guys
as always we appreciate the views this
is clean Youngberg with android 40 calm
you got any questions don't hesitate to
ask peace guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
