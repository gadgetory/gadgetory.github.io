design from the s6 with a couple of
features let's say returning this time
around it's Joshua car from Android
authority what's going on everybody and
this is your first look at the Samsung
Galaxy s7 now while this year there is a
galaxy s7 and s7 edge the S of an edge
is the larger of the two devices as it
will come in at 5.5 inches and the
original s7 will have 5.1 inches in its
screen overall that means that this
metal frame with the dual glass panels
is going to feel pretty easy in the hand
especially for one-handed usage but as
is the case with both of these devices
the backings are now both curved it's
almost as if they took a shrink-ray to
the galaxy note 5 those curves do make
the phone really sit nicely in the hand
and the ergonomics are even better this
time around but overall this is the same
type of phone that you might remember
from the galaxy s6 with only a few
little refinements for example the
camera bump has been minimized on the
backing of course and the front home
button is a little bit more flush with
the actual body itself probably one of
the best additions on this phone is a
returning feature from the galaxy s5
water and dust resistance what we have
here is an IP 68 rating so we will be
able to take a splash and even a tumble
and still be able to keep kicking and as
long as we are talking about returning
features we do have the micro SD card
slot coming back to the galaxy line it
is now part of the dual SIM tray so you
should be able to have dual sams or just
replace one with a micro SD card slot in
order to bolster the onboard storage the
display is the same AMOLED screen that
comes in a quad HD resolution and is 5.1
inches in size and that means high pixel
density along with all of the colors
that's pretty much pop out and punch you
in the face that means a pretty
enjoyable experience on here however and
if it's any indication from the note 5
and the s6 before it to the s7 should
still provide a pretty great experience
when it comes to viewing media games and
text but the addition of an always-on
display is available here and the
always-on display is able to show the
time and the date a calendar a quick
calendar or a certain personalised image
now we went into the settings on the
always-on display in the settings
and we saw that there were only a few
different images and they weren't
necessarily user-defined
nonetheless it is using the AMOLED
display to its good potential only
turning on the various pixels that are
needed in order to show the time or any
other parts that you want to have on
there kind of true to form during our
meeting Samsung did not want to disclose
what the processor is but we expect that
it will indeed be the Exynos 88-90 as
plenty of leaks and various rumours were
suspecting speaking of the processor
however Samsung has found a way to keep
it cool under intense load especially
during gaming there's actually a copper
pipe that will run next to the processor
that has water inside that will
continuously condense back into form in
order to keep cooling the processor
especially under very heavy loads one
thing that I will mention however as
might be a trend in the upcoming year
when it comes to these phones there is
actually a setting inside of what is
called the galaxy labs features which
are supposed to be experimental that you
can actually remove the app drawer now
what they call it is add just moving the
icons over to the home screen and having
all of them displayed on there now we
did see this in the LG g5 as well which
does not have an app drawer altogether
and the option in the galaxy s7 shows us
that there might be a trend moving
towards this new change in Android skins
now the camera is an even bigger bump
from before in the sense that they are
using bigger pixels but less megapixels
you have an F 1.7 aperture lens that has
1.4 micron sized pixels and overall it's
going to be a 12 megapixel rear shooter
that will should be able to bring in
even more light because of the larger
size of those pixels it should be better
all around but low-light shots should be
even better than before going through
the manual mode you still get all of the
different great features including
Kelvin readings in the white balance
this time around and also all of the
different features to be able to cater
the shot to what you need now of course
we were only testing this in the meeting
that we had with Samsung so we weren't
able to take any extensive photos or to
really look at them but if it's anything
like the note 5 or the galaxy s6 from
last year then these cameras should be
performing quite well and finally on the
last bits of the hardware the battery
has been bumped up now the original
versions of the s7 and the s7 edge have
over three
or at least 3000 milliamp hours in their
batteries the s7 will have 3000 and the
larger s7 edge will have 3600 milliamp
hours which should bring quite a bit of
longevity for a full day and hopefully
two days worth of battery life but of
course they still have the wireless
charging available on these bodies and
then fast charging will allow the phone
to charge up really quickly in a very
short amount of time
overall the galaxy s7 and the s7 edge
might not be making a whole lot of waves
in terms of their announcements in the
phone but ultimately it is a great
addition to the galaxy line that takes
some features that were in previous
versions and finally brings them back if
you had the s6 and you wish that it had
the features of let's say micro SD card
slot water and dust resistance and you
wish the power was even better you're
not going to get the replaceable
batteries this time around but at least
the Power has been bumped up and this
just might be the phone that you were
waiting for if the s6 didn't do it
enough for you so keep it tuned to
Android authority when we get our full
review unit of the galaxy s7 and the s7
edge we will give you all of our
thoughts on it especially talking about
the camera and everything else that has
been added into the newest galaxy
flagship keep it tuned here for even
more about the samsung galaxy s7 and
even more from MWC 2016 because we are
