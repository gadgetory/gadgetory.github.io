authority and we're taking a look at the
Samsung lens cover case for the s7 and
s7 edge this is essentially a slim shell
style case that slipped on over the
phone like any other normal case would
but it comes with a lens attached to the
backside to change the field of view
there's a wide-angle version that opens
things up at 180 degrees for wider shots
and a telephoto lens for help you take
closer shots at longer distances the
case itself is pretty standard but the
lenses are made of metal which matches
the high quality feel of the s7 and s7
edge really well and they're also
detachable so you can easily switch back
and forth between the two if you have
them both or just remove it for the sake
of fitting the phone back into your
pocket the nice thing about using these
lenses is that you don't lose any
quality or resolution in the images so
you're still getting the full 12
megapixel shots which you can still zoom
crop and play around with afterwards the
lenses do make the phone look pretty
awkward but another benefit is that you
may not have to carry around another
camera if these lenses do exactly what
it is that you're looking for from a few
shots that I've taken here at Samsung
the lenses work just as advertised and
they're kind of a lot of fun just to
mess around with and see what kind of
shots you can get there's no info on
pricing and availability just yet but
we'll keep you posted on Android or
thorny comm this has been a quick look
of the lens cover case for the s7 and s7
edge keep it tuned here to youtube.com
