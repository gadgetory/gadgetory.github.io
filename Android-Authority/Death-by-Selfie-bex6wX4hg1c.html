who may be a little too selfie happy you
may want to share today's show they
could be in real danger so thus far this
year we've had eight deaths by shark and
twelve by selfies recently a 66 year old
Japanese man was visiting the Taj Mahal
royal gate and tripped and tumbled down
some stairs while attempting to take a
selfie his head injuries led to
unconsciousness and eventually death now
before you think oh that's just the
camera happy Japanese people in the West
have had similar problems earlier this
year a 21 year old woman was posing with
a gun for a selfie when she accidentally
shot herself in the head fortunately
this Moscow woman lived but a Spanish
man who tried to get a picture of
himself during a bull run wasn't so
lucky
no you may be laughing because you think
you would never be stupid enough to do
that but apparently it has become such a
problem that major theme parks and
events like Comic Con at Disneyland have
forbidden selfie sticks Wow
well just remember the king of cool
himself Casey nice that almost got hit
by this while taking a selfie you guys
know the drill you can follow me appear
I'll follow you in the comments and you
don't want to forget about my brothers
and sister your source for all things
