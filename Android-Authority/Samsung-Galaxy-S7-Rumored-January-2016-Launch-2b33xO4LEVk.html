brought to you by domain.com so a little
birdie shared some leaks surrounding the
galaxy s7 korean news outlet ichi news
is reporting that the new super
smartphone will make its official debut
in january
possibly January 19th and that there
should be both a premium and a sub
premium variant Sam mobile had
previously reported that this dual
dichotomy is going to be a follow-up to
the galaxy s6 and s6 edge also mentioned
in the rumor is the report that quote
project lucky will use an e pop chip to
integrate all the necessary sensor
components on a single die an
engineering strategy employed to help
improve efficiency spec wise the details
are somewhat confusing there may be
several different processing variants
depending on the market that the galaxy
s7 is sold in and the flagship
smartphone may use a pressure-sensitive
display technology similar to what Apple
has started marketing also slated are
the USB type-c and a dual camera
arrangement with a brand new 20
megapixel primary sensor as with all
rumors this piece should not be
considered as factual until Samsung so
speaketh the specs could change and the
product launch could even be held later
than the typical Mobile World Congress
debut just a few weeks ago some were
claiming that the s7 would be announced
in December for reference still given
this strategic decision to launch the
galaxy note 5 and s6 edge+
earlier than usual anything is possible
now I'll be the first to start an s7
wishlist and I know many of you are
gonna want at the top of that list SD
card support but I think you gotta let
go with that
detach your heart from it it's not gonna
happen anymore there's too much money to
be made in selling you various internal
storage options but I can talk about a
great camera both front-facing and
rear-facing in the age of the selfie a
whole five megapixel front facing camera
is not going to cut it no more that's
right and of course fantastic battery
life manufacturers are proven that they
can really optimize battery life through
power efficiency and power management
take a note of the Sony's book Samsung
someone he's doing fantastic there and
if you are going to give us variants you
know
maybe you could give us a smaller option
for those of us who don't have LeBron
James hands what do you guys think let
me know in the comments below so do you
know why the dot C and domain name
extension is as popular as it is it's
not because people want a Chinese domain
name extension it's because marketers
know that enough people try and type in
comm and mistakenly type dot CN free
traffic that's the power of the dot-com
now why is that because no domain name
extension tells your story with the same
degree of trust as a.com or.net domain
name dot-com and dotnet domain name
extensions inject credibility into your
