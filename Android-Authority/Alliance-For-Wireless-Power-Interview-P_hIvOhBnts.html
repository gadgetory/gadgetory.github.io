with android authority reporting live
from CES 2015 excuse me been a long few
days i'm here with jeff gordon he's the
chairman of the committee for the
Alliance for wireless power and we're
going to talk about the state of
wireless power and obviously you've been
doing this for a while so what are we
looking at here at CES 2015 so here at
CES 2015 we have a nice booth here with
residents certified products we have
about 18 members who have brought
different technologies here they want to
show off that are all interoperable with
one another we have a variety of desktop
devices that you can use to charge your
mobile phones tablets and other devices
as well as the real key with resident
technology is ability to integrate this
seamlessly with in a surface so we have
a bunch of countertops we have a stone
cafe table they all have residents
transmitting pads built directly
underneath them and all you need to do
to build them in is we actually just use
some double-stick tape yeah or some
screws just to retrofit it in the
existing services we'd have to drill any
holes you have to dig around there just
pop the right up there and we've got
charging at the surface so in terms of
the core technology itself
i under the impression that it's up to
50 millimeters up to 5 centimeters
roughly so officially it's not specified
in our specification the distance but we
tend to talk about about 45 to 50
millimeters and the key there is with
furniture and that most furniture is
Moses design less than 50 millimeters
there's a few few key spots are about 19
26 millimeters is what most thicknesses
are so in terms of taking kind of a high
level overview what we're looking at
with the PMA obviously the Alliance
wireless power we have kind of smaller
players like energies as well and now we
have obviously the wireless power
consortium toasted cheese sander so what
do you kind of see is happening over the
next year two years three years in terms
of what consumers can expect like just
looking at the Alliance for wireless
power point of view first yeah is that
we expect to see products feeding me
roll out in the first half of this year
most likely in a accessory type mode
then towards the second half of the year
we'll start to see more integrated
technologies on the on the phone side so
we'd expect we have some member
companies that have announced support
within their chipsets for wireless
charging nice so when those get
integrated within the phones obviously
there's a real convenience of having it
built into the phone when you buy it
from your particular carrier or other
thanks these reasons and the Alliance
itself are they making
and he moves into potentially being able
to charge laptops or yes so our
technology the specification curly goes
up to 50 watts 51 and so we are actually
today addressing the charging of laptops
one of our demos are actually does show
charging and some other members Intel
specifically has talked about charging
of laptops I know they've shown that off
as well have some real heavy hitters as
part of your lines so welcome and Intel
obviously command significant mindshare
market share yes so but the real sort of
key is that once it becomes integrated
into the circuit itself and there won't
be any need for any sort of accessories
yeah so the two things one is that it's
built in so folks on the phones and
tablets and the other mobile devices
then it's just it's there when you buy
it that's a key and then we're talking
about how they're gonna charge their
phones so people might still go out and
buy a nice dish that they can drop their
phone into or whatever else to charge it
but it but really ideally we get this as
part of the ecosystem so it's built in
where you need it at home in the office
in your car wherever else it might be
are you able to disclose any of the
partnerships potentially with auto
manufacturers or like retailers or
starbucks at McDonald's anyway well
there's really it's our membership
within automotive we have a number of
tier 1 and tier 2 automotive suppliers
we have some things we're demonstrating
here as far as building them into cars
themselves other others of our members
as well have actual full automobiles
with their versions of wireless charging
built in so you can see that that's yeah
as far as and other ecosystems part of
it which I by earlier you mentioned
earlier was the merger that was
announced with the PMA exactly obviously
the PMA has a very nice ecosystem
already that's in place and you know
that obviously the the mergers just been
announced that we're going to start our
discussions on it so you know it's just
basically the letter of intent has been
signed the details of how that's going
to come together
anything we can talk about readily today
but it's still abundant speculate yes it
is it is exactly so so obviously when
you look at combining the two groups
talk about some powerful names within a
40 PT obviously there's a lot more
powerful names there as well can two
competing standards technologically
speaking exist within one alliance this
app also will put it I mean would there
ever be the potential one day for all
the technological standards to be
combined so that consumers could get it
earlier oh the ultimate goal is to have
a single standard yeah that would avoid
any confusion there and it's what we see
with a lot of other technologies yeah so
that would be the end goal and that's
part of what we're seeing with the a4wp
and the PMA combining is that that would
go we go for three to two and that's a
fantastic fact pedestrian problem in the
industry fantastic I think we're all
looking forward to a future with we have
less wires agreed yeah so thank you very
much for your time you're welcome so I
snuck away from Andrea thority reporting
live here at CES 2015 stay tuned for
more coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
