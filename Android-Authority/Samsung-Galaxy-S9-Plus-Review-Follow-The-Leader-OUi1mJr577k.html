venerated Samsung Galaxy S line hey it's
Josh of agarra what's going on everybody
and this is the Samsung Galaxy S 9 in
this case the s9 +
if you had oldness took this phone for
the Samsung Galaxy s8 that came before
it we actually wouldn't really blame you
the glass on glass designed is so common
now for samsung devices and really only
a couple of elements have changed all of
the buttons are done the same places
including the bixby button over on the
left and as far as the ports in the
bottom gulp the headphone jack of course
remains the phone does have a little bit
more heft to it compared to the previous
generation which is nice and the main
change that you're going to see is on
the s9 plus particularly because on the
back you now have a dual end setup and
the fingerprint reader is in a much
better spot the fingerprint reader is
below the camera module now which is the
same for either of the devices but of
course it's pushed down even more due to
the dual end setup of the s9 plus okay
there are a couple of caveats I want to
give with the design of this device and
one of them you're probably expecting
already because this is a glass on glass
design well you're gonna get
fingerprints and smudges on it
incredibly easily and this is a phone
that I'm constantly having to clean for
this very video but another issue did
arise and it's with the gorilla glass on
the front the very top layer of the
Gorilla Glass 5 is already eroding for a
phone that's supposed to be really high
build quality and has the price point to
match it you wouldn't think that this
would be a common problem but this is
something that I've had happened to a
couple of other Samsung devices in the
last couple of years but speaking of
that screen you still get a beast of a
display in the infinity display this
Super AMOLED quad HD resolution display
with so many features to pack with it
there's still that immersive experience
with the sides curving downward into the
body of the phone but it doesn't bleed
all the way down anymore the way it did
in the last two generations the reason
why is because Samsung didn't want there
to be any palm presses anymore so this
does minimize that accidental touch the
Samsung Galaxy S 9 has a 5.8 inch screen
and this s 9 plus has 6.2 inches in its
screen which means that there's a lot of
screen real estate for work and play and
the AMOLED screen provides great
vibrance and wonderful colors the
saturation is exactly where you might
want it to be but of course you can dial
that back in the settings and then
there's everything else that the screen
can do the OS on display is customizable
you can put a number of different
elements on there including an image
that you provide yourself and you're
able to get to those
in the lock screen menu in the settings
underneath that the lock screen can be
set to a 15-second video so if you're
able to edit it in such a way that it
fits perfectly on the vertical screen
then you have an even better looking
lock screen and something that is
incredibly personal and you're still
able to enjoy everything from media to
work to even gaming on here as I've
definitely played my share of games on
the galaxy s 9 plus so far
and speaking of gaming performance is
still where it should be with the best
possible specifications that are
available right now underneath the hood
you have the snapdragon 845 and the
galaxy s 9 plus gets the added benefit
of 6 gigabytes of RAM over its 64
gigabytes of on-board storage that is
expandable with an SD card speaking of
the RAM multitasking is still a treat on
here there are multiple ways of having
more than one application running and
you can have plenty of them running in
the background but Android or EO is what
brings picture-in-picture to here so you
can have a YouTube video just floating
above your workspace and you can always
have that media playing whenever you
want so a theme that you're probably
familiar with in the review of any
galaxy device is the fact that Samsung
is really trying to please just about
everybody and when you look at the
hardware that's certainly the case with
the s9 dual stereo speakers certainly
bring the volume but the sound is also
pretty rich and full thanks to Adobe
Atmos certification it certainly passes
the shower test and on top of all of
that you can actually use this as your
Bluetooth speaker in a way because this
phone has ip68 certification so it's not
going to die under the water but if you
want to use headphones the headphone
jack still returns and it provides a lot
of options inside of the menu you are
able to change the sound using
equalizers Dolby Atmos enhancements and
you're still able to adapt the sound so
it will automatically figure out the
best way to output that audio and on top
of that the phone comes with a gray pair
of AKG headphones just like the last
couple of iterations you get all of the
proper connections on here including NFC
for payments for example and of course
Bluetooth which provides apdex HD audio
support which means that bluetooth
streaming on here is going to sound
really great and if you have a good pair
of bluetooth headphones then you'll be
able to enjoy audio coming from this
phone wirelessly we already mentioned
the fingerprint reader and yes it is in
a much better place but so there is also
an array of
front that allows for other biometric
meters two of the main ways of doing
that face unlock and the iris scanner
have now been put together into what is
called the intelligent scan
intelligent scan basically means that
when you turn on the phone you wake the
phone before unlocking it it will scan
for your face to begin with and then it
will move to an iris scanning if the
conditions aren't really met where this
makes a lot of senses in low-light
situations like at night or right before
bed when you want to use your phone but
it's not able to recognize your face
because it's too dark to do so the
infrared light comes on and then it
starts scanning for your iris and then
it will be able to unlock it fairly
quickly after that now as we get into
battery life it is important to note
that we did not have a galaxy s 9 unit
to really test here we had the larger s9
plus that has 3500 million hours in its
battery compared to the 3000 in the
smaller unit the short story here is
that the battery life is exactly where
you would expect it to be if nothing
exceptional nothing extraordinary here
what you can expect is that the phone
will last an entire day maybe a day and
a half if you don't really use the phone
a whole lot but in the days that I have
been using the s9 plus I have really put
this thing through the ringer now that's
considering that the battery was being
used not only by having the screen on
but also by the camera app and in
conjunction I was able to get about
three hours of screen on time while
running around Casa bio in Barcelona
recording everything that you see later
in the camera section but on other days
when I was doing more media based stuff
like watching YouTube and Hulu or doing
video calls I was able to get six hours
of screen on time which is a little bit
more expected for a big battery despite
the big screen on this phone now when
you do get a little bit low on battery
life you can always turn on the power
saving modes which not only bring down
the clock speed of the processor a bit
but the main thing it does is it lowers
the resolution of the screen you can get
all the way down to HD plus resolution
which obviously makes things look a
little bit weird but at least you're
going to get at least an hour maybe two
hours more of battery life depending on
your usage and then of course there's
the ultra power saver that minimizes the
UI and a lot of the features down to
just its bare minimum with a few
applications like Twitter that you might
use if you absolutely need it
but thankfully it is easy to charge this
phone pretty quickly you're able to get
a bit of the battery back in no time at
all using the included charger with the
full charge maybe taking about 90
minutes there are a number of other ways
to fast charge this including fast
wireless charging or my favorite power
delivery which is the standard built
into USB type-c alright so that finally
brings us to the main focus no pun
intended
of Samsung's enhancements to the s9 and
the s9 plus that's of course the camera
let's start off by doing something kind
of fun so here I am coming to you as my
AR emoji now this may or may not look
like me you can always let me know in
the comments down below what AR emojis
are basically the way for you to express
yourself as a digital avatar this is
Samsung's take on the nmo G's from the
iOS side of things however what the way
that you do this is by detecting your
face using either camera and from there
it will create a caricature of your face
it may or may not be completely accurate
that you can then customize with
different hairstyles different skin
tones different hair colors eyeglasses
of some sort and also a few different
options for clothing one of the main
things that is nice about this emoji is
that it provides 18 different gifts that
you can use to send to pretty much
anybody on any platform so since we're
on the topic of self-expression let's
talk about the front-facing camera
the front-facing camera is an 8
megapixel shooter that is very similar
to the one you found in to the previous
generation one particular addition is in
the form of selfie focus which is its
take on the front facing cameras
portrait mode you take the picture and
then the software will figure out where
the cutout is of you and it will be able
to blur the background in a nice depth
of field or bouquet manner so between
that and the AR emoji there are some
enhanced Beauty mode features the main
one being a co-opting of the big speed a
our makeup feature you're basically able
to put on a full face of makeup in
augmented reality and then just look
fabulous when you hit that shutter
button and I've mentioned this before
but on top of those new enhancements and
the auto focus in this a megapixel
shooter you're still able to record 2k
video on the front which is great for
vloggers like myself so the finally
brings us to the rear cameras and on the
s9 plus like I've mentioned a couple of
times already you get the enhancement of
a second lens the telephoto lens comes
in at F 2.4 aperture and it supplements
what enhancements are put into the main
shooter the 12 megapixel main Lance
with multiframe processing made possible
by actual RAM built into the camera
module again this is kind of in the same
Avenue but still different from the
Google pixel - which uses a lot of the
same functions but has the ability to
use Google photos huge database for that
same amount of data processing you're
already seeing some great results as I'm
talking right now with all of these
photos that I took out in Barcelona and
also back home but there is a feat of
hardware engineering at work here and
it's in the form of the dual aperture
the 12 megapixel camera now has actual
blades in it that can close down the
iris 2f 2.4 aperture but that's not the
main story the main story is that the
wide aperture is at F 1.5 F 1.5 aperture
allows for a ton of light to come into
the sensor and in low-light situations
it is heads and shoulders above anything
Samsung has made before but the question
remains why would you want to have two
different apertures on here well it's
basically Samsung's way of undercutting
what F 1.5 means yes it does allow for
great low-light shots but it also
provides very fine focus sometimes you
don't want that to be the case
especially in broad daylight shots so f
2.4 aperture just undercuts at that
little bit so that you don't have too
many things just incredibly blurred out
in the background but of course you're
able to change between these two
apertures by going into the pro mode and
just swapping the two sightings out
anyway so the main lens does a great job
and in auto mode that aperture will
change without you even knowing it
however some extra optimization might
still be required when you're using
different apertures the rest of the
settings have to change accordingly and
it seems like this camera app still opts
for slower shutter speed over higher ISO
and when you do that the slower shutter
speed could mean that you have some
motion blur in some pictures so the
Samsung camera may not be perfect but it
does its best to get the job done for
just about everybody and if you really
want to have every tool possible for
your smartphone photography the s9 plus
is probably the one you want to look at
and that's because the telephoto lens
provides something that the s9 proper
does not have a proper portrait mode
this live focus mode uses both lenses to
get a narrow focal length while making
it easier for the camera to figure out
where the cutout is this is different
from the selective focus mode that you
only get on the samsung galaxy s 9 where
it's
software-based and the cutouts on there
can be pretty hit or miss just like with
the selfie focus on the front-facing
camera and finally when it comes to
video you have 4k 60 frames per second
video capture on the rear which is great
to have if you want to have beautiful
motion in your videos however when you
do the math that 60 frames per second
video capture means that you can get 960
frames per second super slow-mo at 720p
resolution and in those cases when the
moment is tough to capture the camera
app can go into an auto mode and tries
to figure out when it should trigger the
slow-motion capture what's great about
this camera is that Samsung found a way
to please just about everybody the
casual user will really love a are emoji
and probably get a kick out of super
slow mode but seasoned photographers are
going to find ways of exploiting and
taking advantage of the dual apertures
and overall it just shows that you can
get the best of both worlds in the s9 or
the s9 plus if you really truly need
that zoom capability speaking of trying
to please everybody we can finally talk
about Samsung's version of Android 8.0
Oreo now 8.1 is where we're at in Oreo
right now and it's just not found on
this just yet which might mean that
Samsung has a bit of an update problem
but they don't have a problem when it
comes to features because this is still
incredibly stacked there are the obvious
redundancies with a number of
applications developed by Samsung that
are pretty much covered by Google anyway
like Google Photos or the Samsung
gallery I will give the gallery app some
credit however because it does come with
a couple of extra features not only are
you able to change the different ways
that you can present the bouquet in the
background of a live focused photo but
you are also able to create gifts out of
it essentially a six-second capture out
of any video that can be made into a
quick gift big speed is still in that
button on the left that you can
deactivate you can't really change it to
anything else still but Bixby does have
a few added features on top that might
entice you to use it you're still able
to hold it in order to do voice commands
but there are some live augmented
reality based features that have been
added in like live translation and the
ability to have live food recognition
even if the live food recognition is a
bit hit or miss I have to give it some
credit because it's really trying even
at this bakery I was able to figure out
that this was an egg tart even if it
thought that my coffee was just a cup of
milk
and this is all on top of things like
the game launcher that provides a do not
disturb mode and locks the buttons for
example and you'll still have Samsung
held Samsung notes and pretty much any
other app that you've already seen on
the most previous Samsung Galaxy S or
Galaxy Note devices even if these
redundancies are kind of annoying it is
nice to see that if one doesn't work the
way you wanted to you still have the
option of using the other and so there
you have it - the Samsung Galaxy S 9 and
the S 9 plus the S 9 and the SN plus are
on pre-order right now at prices of 719
and 839 dollars respectively that's a
really hefty price point especially for
phones that definitely have some quirks
but if you had to choose between the two
of them I'd actually recommend the
galaxy s 9
both are great phones it's just that you
get a small bump down in some
specifications and if you really want to
have them then you can go ahead and pay
that extra 120 dollars but a lot of what
Samsung put into these phones that is
new you get in either phone anyway the
AR emojis the dual aperture in the main
lens and if you don't need the telephoto
lens for things like a proper portrait
mode then you don't really have a whole
lot enticing you to get the larger less
easier to handle and definitely more
expensive s9 plus but as is generally
the case with samsung galaxy releases
they do tend to be the best phone for
most people out there and that's because
Samsung has this unwavering desire to
create phones that appeal to just about
everybody and it seems that with the
galaxy s 9 and the S 9 plus they've
probably succeeded in doing that better
than ever before so as always thank you
guys very much for watching hope you
enjoyed this review of the Samsung
Galaxy S 9 plus in particular we'll get
our hands on the smaller galaxy s 9 and
do some more testing on that but you'll
also get a lot more coverage on this
Samsung flagship device as we put it
head-to-head to other phones in the
Android space and potentially against
the iPhone 10 in a more comprehensive
