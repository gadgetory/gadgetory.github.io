something good in the high-end area of
the market the ZTE axon 7 it's super
spec and has a very attractive price
point but they're not neglecting the
entry-level market because that's where
they have their roots established and
today they announced their latest phone
this is the ZTE zmax Pro and some people
are going to have a tough time wrapping
the heads around its pricing first of
all it's going to be available through
metro pcs but more importantly it's
going to start off with a price point of
$100 outright that's pretty aggressive
if you ask anyone but luckily it doesn't
look or feel cheap at all I like some of
the other sub 200 phones out then market
we definitely like the soft touch finish
of the rear case and because it adds a
certain degree of grip to the hand also
being pretty good at being smudge
resistant now the size is going to be
something that some people are going to
think about some weight like it some
might not but considering that this is
$100 the design the bone is pretty good
what you get here is a six inch TFT LCD
display with Gorilla Glass 3 now it's
worth mentioning that it has full HD
resolution which is kind of prescient
because when you think about phones
under $150 not all of them offer Full HD
resolution so it's nice having it here
and it is pretty detailed for the most
part now our issue pertains to the
brightness output it was a cloudy day
not all that bright and even on the
highest button setting it seemed kind of
kind of tough to make out kind of
underpowered and the screen seems to be
highly reflective as well specs wise
it's pretty indicative of its price
point it's a value conscious smartphone
so it's found by 1.5 year it's octa-core
Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 chip with 2
gigabytes of RAM it's going to handle
all the trivial stuff with ease but when
it comes to more processor intensive
stuff you kind know it might not be able
to handle them it has 32 gigabytes of
internal storage it can be supplemented
with a microSD card slot
but there are two things worth noting
about the hardware here first it does
come with a
fingerprint sensors on the back and
that's key because that it adds an
element security and very few phones in
its price range offers a fingerprint
sensor when secondly it offers also a
USB type-c port so at least it's
up-to-date with that in terms of the
connectivity the cameras on the phone
seem to be decent from a specs
standpoint you have a 13 megapixel rear
camera with phase detection autofocus
and then you have a 5 megapixel front
facing camera we did take a few
snapshots with the phone in our time
using it and we check them out on the
phone itself it looked nice but again
it's not really indicative of its real
potential because low lighting is
usually key to telling what phones are
good and what phones aren't
and finally the software now it's
running marshmallow out of the box and
who knows if we'll get the next version
Android but what's more important here
is that it's a mostly stock interface
which is nice
just like the ZTE axon 7 so curious will
like that because it's simple and
straightforward
now however they do include some do
metro pcs software - the biggest thing
about the ZTE zmax pro is its price
point it's $100 that's kind of
ridiculous and also unbelievable at the
same time but that's what it is and
given that it has a fingerprint sensor a
USB type-c port you have expandable
storage you have HD voice functionality
it's a pretty good offering a lot of
value thrown in there but it's only
available to metro pcs and that's the
only limitation and getting this phone
known so if you guys want one more about
the ZTE zmax pro you can check out our
website Android thority comm this is
