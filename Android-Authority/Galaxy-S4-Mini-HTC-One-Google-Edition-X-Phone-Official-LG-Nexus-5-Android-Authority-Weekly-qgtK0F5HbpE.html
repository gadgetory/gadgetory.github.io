you to join me for a look back at the
past seven days in the world of Android
this is the android authority weekly for
June second 2013 there were a few things
officially announced this week that we
all knew her coming and one of those was
the white Nexus 4 we've been hearing
about it since November but now it's
actually in the wild and available in
the Play Store surprise surprise it's
exactly the same as the black Nexus 4
when it comes to the specs and build
it's just well white on android
authority calm a commenter named william
wondered why there is so much discussion
about a new coat of paint for a fairly
old phone fair point moving on while
nothing is concrete we have heard a few
more rumors this week surrounding the
upcoming samsung galaxy note 3 first we
heard that the note 3's camera might
have optical image stabilization this
would be a big step up from the software
image stabilization used in its
predecessor the galaxy note 2 the very
next day we reported on a different
rumor that the note 3 might come with a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor under
the hood considering how quick the
Snapdragon 600 is and the fact that
bigger numbers are always better this
could be very cool of course people were
torn in the comments on whether they'd
rather see a Snapdragon 800 or an Exynos
octa core in the note 3 me I just want
to see it hold up in a drop test better
than the note to date now of course the
ETA is still September for the note 3 so
we've got a wild away try to stay
patient while the wording was less than
clear a comment made by an LG executive
made it look fairly likely that the next
Nexus wouldn't be coming from LG now a
later comment from LG indicated that
they aren't currently working on a nexus
5 but they wouldn't necessarily turn the
opportunity down ok seems clear enough
except that later in the week we heard a
rumor that Larry Page himself had seen a
prototype for a new Nexus from you
guessed it LG now all these stories and
rumors led to a lot of discussion about
who we'd all rather see make the next
neck
this who would you prefer I'm thinking
HP it seems that we've been talking
about the X phone for quite a while now
with no real details on it so it was a
bit of a surprise when Motorola
confirmed both its existence and its
name the Moto X at the d11 conference
Motorola's dennis woodside even went so
far as to say that he had it in his
pocket but couldn't show it to anyone
really come on then just because
Motorola went on to show off its some
really interesting things like digital
tattoos and a slightly scary pill that
turns you into your own password ok
supposedly the Moto X is coming out this
summer and should be fairly cheap that's
cool but you're still not forgiven for
that whole pocket thing Dennis do you
like the look of the samsung galaxy s4
but wish it was smaller and performed
more like an s2 but really somebody said
yes well good for you because that's
what the upcoming samsung galaxy s4 mini
is shaping up to be okay it should be
smaller and faster and lighter and it
does have a larger battery and more RAM
and look-wise it's got that s for style
if you're into that kind of thing
basically it looks like it's going to be
a solid stylish mid-range phone because
I guess Samsung doesn't have enough of
those already google continues to update
its core suite of apps and this week it
was gmail that saw the overhaul both the
android app and the web app now have
automatic sorting options and an updated
look that puts them more in line with
Google+ Google now and the new hangouts
color coding is also included now though
it's much more noticeable in the android
app than the web version of course a lot
of people can't experience this in
person as Google is slowly rolling out
the changes over the next few weeks
while you can force the update by
changing your inbox settings in the web
client you'll just have to be patient
and wait for the update and android app
our final story this week comes from the
yes we already knew that department
basically as soon as the galaxy s4
Google edition also known as the Nexus
user experience was released
rumors were rampant that the HTC one
would be getting the same treatment now
it's official now the hardware is
exactly the same as the stock HTC one
inside and out with one major change
instead of HTC Sense 5 it will run pure
unadulterated Android 4.2 point2 like
the galaxy s4 it will be available
unlocked from the google play store and
it even ships on the same day jun 26 now
almost immediately the comments turn to
discussions of somebody buying an
unlocked HTC One rooting it and putting
on an HTC Sense rum stop giving them
ideas anyway that's it for this week
folks if you look down in the
description you'll find a link to an
article and there we've collected all
the links mentioned in this video and
more we will be back next week same time
same place different host meanwhile if
