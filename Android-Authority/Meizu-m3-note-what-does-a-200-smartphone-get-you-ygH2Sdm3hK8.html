with Android authority you're watching
our video review of the meizu and three
notes with the untrue note Mesa has
replaced the iPhone 5c like colourful
glossy plastic with aluminum it's
implemented quite well too and the
overall design is sharp and assertive
from the seemingly engraved in 10
Alliance to the two and a half T curved
front glass this phone certainly looks
and feels premium the build quality is
also excellent which can always be said
about smart phones in this price
category the power and volume buttons
have moved from the left side to the
right side with this iteration and our
tactile and feel solid overall the phone
feels great in the hand with its curved
aluminum edges the single physical
button on the front of the m3 note
functions as both a back button when
tapped and a home button when pressed
there's also a fingerprint reader
embedded which is fairly fast and
accurate when you want to switch apps
you can simply swipe up from either side
of the physical button to access fly
means multitasking menu
I found this to work very well during my
time with the m3 note and although it's
definitely different from what many are
used to it's a much more intuitive way
to interact with your phone and yes
aspects like the single physical home
button to make the m3 Note look like the
iPhone unless you find the design to be
too derivative for your taste though
you'll likely be more than happy with
the m3 notes look and feel unfortunately
Mesa has taken a step back by ditching
the wonderful eggs open holes found on
the m1 note and m2 note in favor of a
more traditional average-looking panel
it's still 5.5 inches in 1080p but it
lacks some of the vividness and
saturation of the displays found on its
predecessors it's still better than most
in this price category however with
excellent viewing angles and good
contrast sunlight readability seemed
mediocre though and color reproduction
could have been much better
the m3 note is powered by a mediatek
helio p10 which could be considered
comparable to the Qualcomm Snapdragon
617 and you can purchase the m3 note
with either 2 or 3 gigabytes of RAM
overall performance is still decent for
the price and although apps are
sometimes noticeably slow while loading
performances otherwise fairly good the
same can't be said when playing
higher-end games however is the phone
can struggle with slow load times and
very low frame rates it seems that the
Mali t8 60 MP 2 GPU simply isn't enough
to drive these titles which is truly
disappointing is even the m1 note had no
trouble in this department
the m3 note is an unlocked dual SIM
device and you can use one of the SIM
card slots for a microSD card up to 256
gigabytes if the phone 16 or 32
gigabytes of internal storage isn't
enough while the m3 note does support 4G
LTE in many countries those in the US
will be limited to HSPA+ on AT&amp;amp;T mobile
call quality seem to be decent and
although my earpiece sounded fine caller
said they sometimes had difficulty
understanding me unless you make many
calls however this is unlikely to be an
issue meizu has yet to make the
transition to USB type-c and their
affordable line up and you'll be stuck
with microUSB with the m3 note this
should be good for people who don't want
to purchase new cables but may be
annoying for those who have already made
the transition the single side powering
speaker on the m3 note is reasonably
loud but moderately distorted especially
at higher volumes it certainly does the
job but it's not a step up from the m1
note nor the m2 no battery life was
excellent in my testing as I was able to
achieve about five and a half hours of
screen on time with normal use or about
four and a half look lighter use the
meizu m3 note 13 megapixel rear camera
offered average performance for the
phone's price captured images often lack
detail were surprisingly soft and lack
the dynamic range required for higher
contrast scenes and although the
accurate color reproduction and
appropriate amount of set
raishin are appreciated we noticed lots
of digital noise which distracted from
the overall picture even in good
lighting and low light images came out
very poorly which was sort of to be
expected at this price point autofocus
did seem a bit slow too and sometimes
even refused to focus altogether
overall the camera here seems to not
offer much of an upgrade over the m2
notes with the exception of some minor
improvements in the camera app the easy
to use automatic mode is complemented by
a variety of different filters the apps
manual mode offers a great amount of
control for those wishing to delve
deeper the m3 note is shipping with
mazes custom a fly me 5os on top of
android 5.1 lollipop it would have been
nice to see Android 6.0 marshmallow as
it has been out for nearly a year now
but fly me does do a nice job at
substituting features like fingerprint
reader support although fly me is a
sharp departure from stock Android and
could be considered as a glorified
spin-off of iOS it's one of the most
well refined and polished Android skins
out there and with Flemmi 5 Mesa has
made the experience better by addressing
our complaints and making many subtle
changes it was great to see meizu
finally add a settings shortcut in the
notification panel and redesign the
multitasking menu with beautiful
animations the pre-installed apps are
incredibly well designed and I found
myself even enjoying simple apps like
the clock and calendar although it does
not have an app drawer you can always
just download a third-party launcher
through the Google Play Store which is
included out of the box on international
units fly me five is easily one of the
best Android skins out there and maybe
one of the m3 Notes best aspects users
can also look forward to future updates
which are sure to only improve the
experience further the m3 note is 800 UN
in China or about $120 and can be
imported for about $200 in India is
priced at ten thousand rupees or about
$150 there are multiple models available
as well as different color options
depending on the region although the
meizu m3 note does pack a very large
punch with its premium design
excellent battery life an exceptional
software experience its lack of us
availability poor gaming performance and
unimpressive camera do not help it stand
out
now that fly me five is available in
previous iterations - there's nothing
particularly compelling here with the
exception of the new design and the
fingerprint reader if you can do without
those edit features you should look at
the m2 note instead for a bit lies
otherwise the mx-5 is still a great
option for just a bit more and it offers
a very similar design much better AMOLED
display better performance and a better
camera if you'd rather venture outside
of mazes product line the xiaomi redmi
note 3 is still the budget phone to beat
and it sold at the same price in many
markets including india thank you for
