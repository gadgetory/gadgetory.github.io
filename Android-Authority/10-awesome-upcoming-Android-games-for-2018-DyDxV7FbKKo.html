handy the Android authority app guy and
20:18 has some decent mobile games
coming up and we wanted to talk about
them just a little bit let's roll that
intro and get started
black desert mobile is an open-world
action game with hack and slash elements
it features five different characters
seven battle modes and a bunch of
minigames like fishing logging mining
and other stuff it's a little bit
reminiscent of gauntlet legends but with
deeper gameplay better graphics more
minigames and a longer narrative this
one should be out soon if it isn't
already however the first launch
destination is South Korea with other
places ostensibly coming later it should
be one of the better games for action
hack and slash fans in 2018 DC unchained
is a giant drop of fanservice into the
pool of existing comic-book properties
it'll feature some of DC's biggest
heroes and villains fighting alongside
one another and against one another it
has that freemium element of ignoring
the whole good versus bad thing by
letting you assemble teams of just about
any character that you can get your
hands on the gameplay doesn't look
amazing but there should be lots of
explosions this one will undoubtedly be
popular even if it seems blatantly
average based on the trailers still a
good time waster never hurt anybody
Final Fantasy 15 Pocket Edition is one
of those mobile RPGs that console RPG
fans might actually get excited about
it's basically the entire console game
refitted for mobile with simpler
graphics and touch controls this game is
broken up into ten episodes all of which
will be available at launch
unlike other episodic style games that's
probably why the game has been delayed
several times already this one should be
out on February 9th but don't be shocked
of Square Enix delays this one again
grid Autosport is an upcoming racing
game with some good potential
it features above-average graphics tons
of cars and tons of tracks to race
through this game also sets itself apart
by having a bunch of difficulty levels
and potentially even hardware controller
support it's already out on iOS where it
Garner's a decent 4.1 rating the Android
version should be out sometime in the
first half of 2018
the iOS version is also a pay once game
with some optional DLC and we really
hope the Android version ends up being
similar Harry Potter Wizards unite is
among the top games when it comes to
hype in 2018
and it's the next game by Niantic lab
makers of ingress and the
record-breaking pokemons go
they bring their unique augmented
reality style gameplay to the Harry
Potter universe with this title that
means it'll encourage players to explore
the real world to get various spells and
prizes while also fighting massive
bosses there isn't a ton of details at
this point and it might not even come
out in 2018
we're also guessing that it'll be a
freemium game like my antics other
offerings it'll most assuredly be quite
popular upon release paid a crime war is
actually already successful on PC and
console and the mobile port is likely
coming sometime in 2018
the game features 4 vs. 4 pvp where one
side plays the role of robbers trying to
loot a place while the other side plays
the role of the cops
each round features various weapons and
ability upgrades as you play thus there
is a minor MOBA element as well it'll be
interesting to see how they adapt the
controls to mobile with this one and it
should be one of the better FPS titles
this year player unknowns battleground
battlefield is the mobile version of the
viral hit game from 2017 it features a
lot of the same gameplay elements as the
console and PC version you get dropped
off on an island and you must be the
last one standing at the end of the game
the mix of fps and open-world actually
gives the game a certain charm among
fans of both genres the game is actually
already out in China and we're not
entirely sure if it's gonna make its way
westward however given the popularity of
the franchise
they'd be stupid not to tech and mobile
is an upcoming fighting game based on
the popular console fighters of the same
name that verbage is intentional because
this really isn't a Tekken game it's one
of those fighters that kind of plays
itself like the popular injustice and
Mortal Kombat mobile games it features
20 character as various special moves
and a progression system however the
mechanics seem to be little more than
tapping cards during combats it'll be a
good popular time waster but it might
not be a good fighting game this game is
available on Google Play for
pre-registration right now Tom Clancy's
shadow Break is actually on the brink of
being released everywhere it's already
on Google Play but it's only available
in a few countries the game features
real-time PvP combat FPS and strategy
mechanics and a ton of freemium stuff
like upgrades character collecting and
the like the multiplayer is a little bit
different from what we're used to seeing
you play support in the back while your
characters run forward toward the enemy
however it does still pale in comparison
to its console counterparts this one
should make its way around the world
sooner or later telltale Games's
launching their final season of the
critically acclaimed Walking Dead series
the long story follows a girl named
Clementine as she tries to survive in
the Walking Dead universe and this last
edition lets you shape her future as you
decide what kind of person she's going
to be the game made waves with its
comic-book style graphics and those
return for the final installment
additionally it'll share most of the
gameplay and storytelling mechanics from
the previous three seasons this one
doesn't have a release date yet but it
should be in 2018 at some point there
are plenty of other big-name titles
floating around and we didn't have time
for all of them we also didn't include
games in beta because those are publicly
available and we wanted to talk about
the stuff that hasn't been made
available just yet mobile games still
have a ways to go but it feels like this
year is going to be a lot better than it
was last year as always if we missed a
game that you feel should have been on
this list leave us a comment and tell us
about it and that about does it for this
one folks if you want to read more we
have the written version linked up in
the video description below with some
additional information and also don't
forget to subscribe and ring the bell to
get the latest android authority videos
as soon as they come out thanks again
for watching everybody and have a
wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
