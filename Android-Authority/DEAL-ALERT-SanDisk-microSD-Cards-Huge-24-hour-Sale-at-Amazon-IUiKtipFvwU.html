android authority what's going on
everybody and over at Android Authority
com we do have deal alerts where we tell
you about all the best deals on
everything android or android related
but today's deal of the day is something
that we really wanted to tell you about
via this video because it's really
relevant and important especially with
Father's Day coming up so every day
amazon does what they call deal of the
day where they put massive discounts on
various products and today's one that
just started like a few hours ago deals
with sandisk memory so that includes
everything from USB drives to solid
state drives compact flash cards and SD
cards and most importantly micro SD
cards now it should be pretty obvious
why this is relevant well if you have
upgraded your phone recently to one of
the current flagships whether it's from
sony samsung or HTC or even if you're
planning on getting the upcoming LG g3
well now thankfully a new trend is that
micro SD cards are making a comeback and
for anybody that really wanted
expandable storage from last year's
flagship small now this year you got
them and that's not even the best part
if you head over to amazon.com and you
take a look at the deals you'll notice
that the cards that are on sale are
actually some of the best ones that are
available pretty much all of them come
in at class 10 now if you see class 10
it's that 10 with the circle around it
on your SD cards or micro SD cards those
are fundamentally the best cars that are
available there are some cards with
enhancements like the sandisk ultras or
the extremes that give you even faster
read or write speeds but especially for
smartphone usage if you got that 10
right there you pretty much are good to
go so as you already know we are here to
serve you so once we got wind of this
deal we wanted to let you know as fast
as possible like I said it just started
a few hours ago and it's going on
throughout the day on june night which
is obviously today and it is only a one
day deal so head on over to amazon com
and make sure you grab your SD card for
let's say your pops who just got a new
phone maybe you help them get it and
they need expandable storage for other
music or pictures or all those selfies
they think they're taking but in reality
they're using the rear camera on
accident and you can also even get a
microSD card for that special someone
who maybe just got a phone that can take
a micro
the corner put all this music on it
remember mixtapes mixtapes are really
cool it's too bad we can't really do
stuff like that anymore what would you
even call it hey baby I made you a mix
card oh and actually that's not all
because we have yet another deal alert
for you on this very same day only today
there is also one hundred dollars off
certified refurbished kindle fire HD 8.9
tablets now the thing that actually
makes me excited about this particular
tablet and if you want to see our review
of the kindle fire tablet i did do them
a little while back and i actually
thought these were really good tablets
especially if you are a big amazon prime
user it's a great way of getting all of
that media straight to one place but one
thing that is great about this tablet is
the fact that it is the one that gets 4g
LTE so if you don't really have Wi-Fi
available all over the place well you
can get your 4g LTE set up on this
tablet and it comes in at a really good
price at just 199 for the 8.9 inch
version especially if you're a big
amazon prime user and you watch a lot of
TV shows and movies on amazon prime
instant well this tablet might be one of
the best things for you and it could be
either for you or for someone that
you're gifting either way it's a great
price on a great tablet so if you want
