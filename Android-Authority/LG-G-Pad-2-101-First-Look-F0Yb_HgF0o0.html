brings LG to 10.1 inches in its screen
hey it's Joshua regard from Android
authority what's going on everybody and
this is the LG G pad - at first glance
obviously with the LG G pad to the 10.1
inch screen is the centerpiece here it
comes in at full HD resolution but as
you move around the device you'll find
that this is actually a pretty nimble
device despite the larger screen it
comes in at 7.8 millimeters thick and
features a soft metallic finish on the
back which looks like brushed metal but
despite having that really nice feel it
also tends to be a little bit slippery
and obviously took to the finger prints
pretty easily the somewhat larger bezels
on the side mounted dual speaker
suggests that LG imagined this tablet
for landscape usage primarily and the
phone metallic finish is available in
just this born color you're seeing right
now which is called brilliant bronze
underneath however you have the
Snapdragon 800 the quad core Edition
with two gigabytes of RAM 16 gigabytes
of internal storage that is actually
expandable though so if for those of you
that have been hankering for expandable
storage and all your devices recently
this tablet has it in spades you have
your micro SD card slot available in the
back even a 5 megapixel camera you can
see there in the back with a 2 megapixel
camera up front will be available for
all of this really quick photos that you
might want that aren't necessarily going
to be of the highest quality if tablet
cameras have anything to do with it but
then we have a 70 400 milliamp hour
battery underneath that should be able
to power the tablet for a pretty good
while especially for those of you who
might be binge watching for hours on end
on this tablet
LG's GUI is still what powers here so
really with this big screen you should
have enough room for all of the
different elements that the GUI tries to
really throw at you everything from the
qslide applications to the great dual
window that should work really well on
this larger display and then everything
underneath including quickmemo+ and all
of the different widgets that LG has put
in for better usage across the board the
GUI might be a little bit Sacher
oversaturated rather when it comes to
its features but really it is still very
functional and should be able to be
powered by the Snapdragon 800 in a very
easy way that being said it will come
pre-loaded with Microsoft Office for
anything
tablet and an additional 100 gigabytes
of free onedrive storage for two gears
so if the storage with the microSD card
slot in the back is still not enough for
you then you have even more in the cloud
but actually the fun doesn't really stop
there because we also have a new
peripheral that's available specifically
for this tablet but can be used with
other ones as well as it is a Bluetooth
keyboard that is a fold-out keyboard and
when you fold it out it feels almost
like a laptop keyboard but what's great
about it is that it feels really nice
now typing on this particular keyboard
is really easy just have to fold it out
and then there are some stands in the
back that will allow you to stand in
particular the LG G pad - 10.1 on it so
you can use it almost like a almost like
a convertible tablet or in all-in-one in
sort so it kind of has that feel to it
especially when you have these really
solid keys here now one thing about
typing on here is that there is a large
gap between the lines here that does
take a little bit of getting used to so
after typing on it for a little while we
were able to still get up to speed one
triple a battery power is this
particular fold-out keyboard that we
were told will come in at around $100 so
even if you're looking for an investment
in input for one of your other devices
not necessarily just the LG G pad - we
do think that this one is pretty nice
already put taking it all together
though it's just a really nice looking
package and we do look forward to
looking at the Jeep head - 10.1 when we
get our hands on it in a review unit so
keep it tuned to Android authority for a
review of that and even more and we'll
probably take a look at this keyboard in
the future again as well so keep it
tuned to you for even more as we bring
you the best from Aoife here in Berlin
Germany this is Joshua car from Android
authority coming to you live from our
meeting here with LG</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
