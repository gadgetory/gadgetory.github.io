from Android Authority comm and today
we'll be taking a look at the citizens
tap out it's a free game in the Google
Play Store based around the lives of the
most famous animated town in history the
premise of the game is rather simple
Homer has finally managed to blow up the
Springfield power plant and the town
lies in ruin together with a lot of the
cast from The Simpsons
Homer must reunite himself with his
family and rebuild Springfield to its
former glory the menus have been built
into the game so there are no menu
screens to really deal with everything
happens in game in the bottom right
corner you'll have access to your build
menus including buildings scenery and a
spot to buy more Donuts should you want
them there is also an option to visit
alternate Springfield once a day for a
little extra money and experience and
the bottom left is the tasks menu along
with a five-star rating that will help
you determine what you need to build
more of tap out itself is a sim more
specifically a construction and
management sim you'll be buying new
buildings and tapping them for resources
to build even more buildings the game
starts with pretty much a clean slate
and the tutorial will walk you through
learning how to build new buildings and
make characters perform action once the
tutorial is over it's pretty much free
ring you can buy land to expand
Springfield and commence restoring it to
its former self it plays like any
classic construction sim with no real
learning curve so just about anyone can
get into this game and be a pro at it by
the time the tutorial is over because of
its simplicity and the fact that there
is always something more to do we gave
Tapout a gameplay value of 4 out of 5
stars
graphics and tap out or as good as they
can possibly be it is on par with any
episode of The Simpsons not the old CRT
standard-definition Simpsons but like
the movie or the later seasons the
graphics are crisp and clear and all the
characters and buildings look as they do
in the show it isn't really related to
graphics but all the characters are
voiced by their real voice actors so
there's no cheap impersonations here
each character has a set of catchphrases
that they utter when you make them do
tasks and it helps add to the overall
feel of the game in addition there are
also exclusive cutscenes so fans of The
Simpsons will no doubt enjoy that when
you get to the bottom line this is a
game that's supposed to sound and look
like The Simpsons and it absolutely does
so we gave graphics a 4.5 out of 5 stars
the replay value is difficult to judge
since there's no indication that this
game ever ends we assume that at some
point that all the buildings will be
built in all this
will be used in that all the things will
be unlocked however based on just a few
days of testing we've determined that
this is going to take eternity in
addition the game syncs up the servers
every time you open it and downloads new
content if there is any so this game is
an active development it may not end for
a very long time if the game ever does
come to an end we imagine people won't
want to play it through a second time so
we gave replay value a 2 out of 5 stars
when it's all said and done Tapout is a
fun game with a lot of content between
the actual rebuilding process and all of
the characters there is always something
to do you are after all rebuilding the
legendary Springfield in addition to
being fun there's actually some
storyline here Homer blowing up the city
the need to rebuild it and fighting Lisa
Bart Maggie and Marge helps drive the
game forward with a purpose so it's not
like Sim City where you're just building
things perhaps most importantly this
feels like a bonafide Simpsons
experience the graphics are on par with
the show itself and all the characters
are voiced by the original cast we can't
stress enough how this adds to the gamer
experience if you're a fan of The
Simpsons and of building sims this is a
must own game even if you're just a fan
of building sims it's still pretty good
also it's free so we gave value of 4.5
out of 5 stars once again on Joe handy
