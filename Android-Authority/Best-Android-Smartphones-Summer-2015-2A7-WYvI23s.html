to you by domain.com so if you want the
very best Android smartphone on the
market and you've got that chatter to
buy it your options look a little
something like this
now first on our list is the Samsung
Galaxy s6 the Korean giant has finally
delivered a truly premium Galaxy S
experience melding a glass front and
back with a metal frame most tech
journalists and even everyday tech
enthusiasts agree that the redesign is a
welcome one but of course samsung's new
look isn't without some sacrifice
Samsung has ditched the removable
battery and the microSD support another
major change for the galaxy s6 is the
processing package with Samsung electing
to leave behind Qualcomm slowly offering
up its own Exynos 7420 processor paired
with three gigabytes of RAM and finally
the software has also been scaled back a
bit with the latest iteration of the
Galaxy S like the idea of the galaxy s6
but hoping for something that stands out
among the crowd even more the galaxy s6
edge offers the same specs but adds dual
edges and a few special features that
take advantage of the phone's unique
design now although the LG g4 is second
on our list it's likely first in the
hearts of hardcore geeks and here's why
the LG g4 is one of the few flagships to
come with a removable back cover which
makes it possible for an even rarer
feature a replaceable battery a gorgeous
quad HD display a great camera
experience and is smooth and fluid
software iteration make for a fantastic
device if what is missing in other
flagships kept you from buying them the
g4 might be the phone you're looking for
you may also want to consider the Moto X
style now by style Motorola is mostly
referring to customization capabilities
a factor which has been an integral part
of the Moto X experience since day one
customers can use Moto maker to
manipulate their devices aesthetics to
their will you can change the color of
the metal areas and grave the back and
even choose from a plethora of back
options including leather wood rubber
and other materials now we all know that
the Galaxy Note 5 is just around the
corner but until that is officially
released the note 4 is still the king of
while some competitors are offering
larger screens none of them can match
the note fours productivity boosting
stylus the S Pen can truly enhance the
way you interact with your phone with a
strong focus on doing actual work from
basic research to composing a quick
message to multitasking but it's not
just work basically anything that
requires precision and speed can be done
better with a good stylus while
samsung's touchwiz often gets a bad
reputation nobody can deny that the note
fours feature set is super compelling
you can make the most of that 5.7 inch
screen with the new and improved
multitasking tools and that's something
you simply don't get another high-end
Android phones and with the latest
iteration of the series the note 4 looks
as good as it gets
thanks to that finally chamfered
aluminum frame if you're looking for the
ultimate device in getting things done
the note 4 is probably your best choice
now let's talk about the new kid on the
block the oneplus 2 it's getting harder
and harder for any manufacturer to
really compete with Chinese phone makers
in terms of value and oneplus is no
different so what do you get for the low
price of 329 u.s. well the phone is a
beast
featuring specs that include a
snapdragon 810 processor 3 or 4
gigabytes of RAM a 5.5 inch full HD
screen it also sports a massive 3300
milliamp hour battery that should keep
the phone running for a very long time
in addition the oneplus is offering a
variety of style swap covers making it a
breeze to customize your smart phone on
the go
there's wood sand stone and even Kevlar
options available now let's talk about a
phone that you may not know that much
about it's ZTE zaxxon we don't take it
easy on smartphones when we put together
a full review so the ZTE zaxxon getting
an 8.9 score really says a lot about the
new handset this phone is a beauty
especially consider the $449 price tag
it is everything you could expect from a
high-end device and a bit more the ZTE
axon features a beautiful metal design a
vibrant display powerful performance a
clean software experience with very
little bloatware and high
audio in addition customers get some out
of treats such as a free pair of JBL
headphones and even a two year free
protection plan they call it axon
passport and it even includes accidental
damage protection now although this
phone is not in the article I gotta
mention the Sony Xperia z3 compact for
anyone who really wants a one handed
option you should really check that out
what else did I miss let me know in the
comments below alright since it's been a
couple weeks since we've given away

domain name that's a.com that has not
been used before and makes me laugh will

trust as a.com or.net domain name
