own approach but for Sony its interface
hasn't seemed as polished as its rival
OMS however the company is using its
concept for marshmallow program as an
opportunity to learn from customer
feedback and after a few days with the
update we're asking is Sony's interface
about to get the major overhaul that it
desperately needs hey what's going on
everybody its NER of here friend road
authority bringing you a quick look at
Sony's concept marshmallow running on
the Sony Xperia z3
Sony's hardware is definitely premium
but its software has been somewhat
lackluster of late with elements such as
small apps still present despite a lack
of positive user feedback Sony's
interface has also traditionally been
quite slow but one thing you'll know is
immediately about the marshmallow update
is just how fast and fluid it actually
is prior to marshmallow Sony adopted a
similar approach to some of its rivals
by customizing large parts of the
Android experience but this resulted in
sluggish performance with this
marshmallow update however Sony has
adopted the less is more approach and
like Motorola he is running an almost
stock version of marshmallow with the
addition of just a few small Sony
changes in tweaks the first thing you'll
notice is the Sony launcher which looks
quite similar to previous versions but
hasn't improved to make it much faster
alongside the launcher Sony has also
tweaked the Settings app to include more
options than are present on stock
Android as you might have expected based
on past handsets
Sony has also replaced a stock gallery
and music players with its own album and
music applications Sony's other
additions to the OS included Xperia Care
application and its own camera app the
experior care app provides quick access
to support topics and warranty
information and helps you customize your
smart phone while in the camera app a
key change is the speed of the app with
photos now capturing and loading much
faster than they do on lollipop there's
also less camera apps pre-installed and
the options are quite minimal packaged
inside a sneak and relatively easy to
use camera experience so this is a quick
hands-on but what do you take away from
Sony's concept for marshmallow project
it's really simple sony is finally
fixing its software and if the final
product is as quick as this beta sony
may yet find a smartphone division
regain profitability the concept for
marshmallow project is a vision of a new
Sony and this is how all Sony smartphone
should be fast fluid and no silly
preloaded apps just a clean experience
with a few small additions to the stock
OS so what do you think about Sony's
concept for marshmallow and do you want
to see it running on your Sony Android
handset let us know your views in the
