Android authority here at Samsung's yes
2017 and checking out through to new
Samsung Chromebook laptops coming out
soon we have the two versions one is an
ARM based chipset the old ones skylake
the Samsung Chromebook plus and pro the
plus is the arm chipset and pro is going
to be the one with skylight so in terms
of design it is very light I gotta say
very lightweight skinny thin not a whole
lot of heft to it which is nice pad by
chromebook and the neat thing about this
one is that you could actually run now
Google Play apps up to two or three apps
from what they tell me so you have the
entire Google Play Store at your
disposal so apps that you're familiar
with Facebook Instagram because run role
here the other unique thing about this
this Chromebook is that now it has this
stylus pressure-sensitive stylus and
what I saw is that you know you can use
it to write down notes there's a search
function so if you write down your notes
it you could actually search for
previous notes so let's say you wrote a
bunch of notes that had hello in it you
could actually search for that in here
and it's very useful because if you
prefer that pen paper time and bl you
have this just like the it's think you
know the note series and any of the
other device out there that has a stylus
and it has a convertible aspects of 360
degrees you can flip around so again
gives you that paper pen like feel to it
yeah if you don't wanna use the keyboard
keyboards pretty good good tactile feel
to it
you have the trackpad here some of the
ports on the sides you have your phone
controls your USB type-c it's a 2400 by
1600 resolution display it is
touchscreen and it's it's a pretty good
productivity bathe type of laptop so
this is Samsung Chromebook plus like I
said there's skylake version and also
the ARM based chipset the arm ones going
to be coming out first in the spring
believe it's for 49 they haven't
and thinking about the pro version so
that is a quick look at these two
upcoming Chromebooks from Samsung if you
guys wanna learn more bad you can check
