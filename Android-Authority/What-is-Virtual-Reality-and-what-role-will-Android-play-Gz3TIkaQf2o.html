Ranger Authority today we are entering
the question what is virtual reality
virtual reality is an immersive computer
system that mimics the world we see
around us it can also be used to create
imaginary world which is particularly
useful for creating immersive gaming vr
itself isn't a new idea in fact it was
first described in the 1930s and the
first VR system was built in the late
1960s his boon time came in the 1990s
when companies like Sega and Nintendo
started developing consumer level vr
gaming products how after a boom there
is often a bust and that is what
happened with VR Sega's product was
never released and Nintendo's virtual
boy was a commercial failure and since
they're not much has changed at the
consumer level and it isn't just because
of the computing power needed to do vr
properly think about the size of laptops
and mobile phones from that era they
were quite big therefore to do VR
headsets properly a lot needs to change
in terms of militarization materials
displays and of course the computing
power and that's what's happened now now
almost after 20 years VR is making a
comeback in 2012 Palmer Luckey started a
Kickstarter campaign for an immersive
virtual reality headset for video gaming
called the oculus rift it aimed to rate
250 thousand dollars but in the end
raised an amazing 2.4 million dollars in
2013 John Carmack famous for his 3d
games like doom and quake joined the
oculus team the oculus rift is designed
to be connected and used with a PC
however Carmack helped develop a mobile
version in collaboration with Samsung
the Samsung gear VR uses a smartphone
which is clicked into the headset to
create a VR platform it is an untethered
solution which means there are no wires
printing it to a pc or other computing
device the smartphone's GPU is
used to render the virtual world and the
phone's display is split into half for
the image is needed by the left and
right eyes the headset also includes the
head tracking module from the oculus
rift the original gear VR only work with
the note 4 however samsung recently
released a new version to coincide with
the launch of the samsung galaxy s6 both
these gear VR versions carry the title
innovate edition meaning they are
intended for early adopters and for
developers however during a recent
keynote speech at GDC John Carmack said
that the gear VR would become a true
consumer level prank later this year and
he hinted strongly that this would
happen with the release of the samsung
galaxy note5 the two other big players
in the re-invigorated VR market are Sony
and Microsoft in 2014 sony announced
project Morpheus a virtual reality
headset for the PlayStation 4 the
headset which is reported to be able to
do graphics 120 frames per second is set
to be released sometime during 2016
unlike project Morpheus Microsoft's
product the hollow lens is an untethered
headset that will work with Windows 10
it is different from gear VR in that the
hollow lens come to this own built-in
computing module and doesn't use your
smartphone it's also different in that
it doesn't use an oled display that is
placed directly in front of the users
eyes but rather it uses transparent
goggles with a form of projection or
head ups display system this is where we
cross the line between virtual reality
and augmented reality although VR and AR
might look very similar because you need
to wear a headset or some form of
special goggles they are in fact quite
different and have different goals and
ultimately they have different consumer
markets before leaving our discussion on
AR I want to mention epson's movi Rio
smart glasses unlike Google glass the
movi Rio smart glasses don't try to be a
normal pair of everyday glasses they are
as dead designed for tasks that need AR
but like Google glass the mo vario
glasses as Android as we can see well
the difference in the oculus rift and
the gear VR today's
dr. Ettie market is split into two
tethered and untethered the advantage of
the tethered approaches at the
processing power and the electrical
power comes from a PC or a console and
these have high performance CPUs and
high performance GPUs however the
disadvantage is is that they are really
tethered to one place to the room in
your house wherever your PC or console
is located however the untethered
approach gives you portability wherever
you go your VR headset can go with you
it's portability also means it has a
greater social impact although using a
VR headset could be considered as
antisocial when used in public there is
an aspect of sharing the VR experience
with a group of friends for example the
wow factor you get when the headset is
passed from one person to another so it
seems that the tethered and untethered
markets will coexist and grow together
for quite some time in the future there
may be some convergence as the headsets
become more Universal and are able to be
driven by any device however at the
moment android plays an important role
as we can see from the Samsung gear VR
it's more than able providing an
excellent experience and because it
already is a full multitasking operating
system based on linux it's able to do
this as well as any other operating
system however because it's a mobile
operating system it's already optimized
for the untethered use case samsung gear
vr isn't the only android VR solution at
the low end is google cardboard designed
as a way to get people interested in VR
the Google headset is made from
cardboard this means it is cheap and you
can get a headset under twenty dollars
of course it isn't the most ergonomic ly
designed piece of equipment in the world
and you're probably isn't going to be
very comfortable for long periods
however as a way into VR cardboard is
great Google currently has around 50
apps in its featured cardboard section
in Google Play the challenges for
untethered VR devices and tethered via
our devices are quite different for
example one of the main problems that
faces the oculus rift is it needs to get
game down to the marketplace so it
becomes a de facto standard for vr
gaming course there are still technical
issues however many of the problems that
plagued VR technology of the 1990s has
already been overcome for untethered VR
devices the challenges are different
first of all the headsets don't have a
main power supply everything needs to be
based on a battery that means that power
consumption is always going to be a
factor secondly the current crop of
untethered VR headsets like Google
cardboard and gear VR rely on the screen
that's built into your smartphone this
of course affects picture quality
refresh rates and resolution also with
untethered headsets the GPU in the
smartphone is being used to generate the
virtual world although mobile GPUs are
sophisticated bits of hardware they
aren't up to the same quality and speed
aphek cards we find in pcs and that's
normal have you seen the size of the
graphics card in your PC what this means
is that VR headset makers are now
pushing the boundaries for mobile
graphics VR developers are looking for
greater frame rates and higher mobile
GPU performance the one major concern
for VR OEMs is motion sickness your
brain is an incredible thing and it
isn't easily fooled when your inner ear
to text motion but your eyes don't see
the same motion then you start to feel
sick you may have experienced this on a
boat or in a car the same thing can
occur when using VR headsets and it's
sometimes referred to as simulator
sickness if your brain detects that you
have moved your head but your eyes don't
see the same movement then some people
can feel sick also some people feel sick
when you're I detect movement but there
is no corresponding physical movement VR
headset makers like oculus are very
aware of this problem and are treating
it seriously in fact when the gear VR
hits mainstream it will have its own app
store and any apps which could cause
motion sickness will carry a very clear
warning label this is an exciting time
for VR there are some big companies
involved Samsung Sony and so on and it
looks like they're bringing out a really
interesting range of products it looks
like the technology problems of the
1990s have been resolved especially
those in terms of militarization and
pricing also VR is going to be a driver
of lots of new technologies including
motion tracking movement sensors
displays and mobile G
use three downside I can see is what
happens when the lawyers get involved
and if the different companies start
suing each other for paint violations
well let's just hope that doesn't happen
my name's Gary Sims round your authority
I hope you enjoyed this video if you did
please give it a thumbs up also don't
forget to subscribe to android
authorities youtube channel and also
leave some comment to tell me what you
think about VR have you used a gear VR
are you going to buy an oculus rift tell
me what you think and as for me I'll see
you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
