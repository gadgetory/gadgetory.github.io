Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome to the first episode of Google
Play weekly in the year 2014 CES is
right around the corner and the holiday
season is finally over so let's take a
look at what happened in the world of
applications this week and our first bit
of news this week LG is expected to
announce a brand new application at CES
called home chat home chat is an
application that lets you control your
appliances using text messages obviously
you'll have to buy the compatible
appliances for it to work but this is
actually really cool you'll be able to
do things like put your fridge and power
saver mode start and monitor your
washing machine till your vacuum to
clean at certain times turn on your oven
and a host of other features LG you'll
be using the popular line application
which is available on most mobile and pc
operating systems so you'll be able to
use it almost anywhere late last week
there was an exploit that was announced
that allows hackers to steal people's
phone numbers to date over 4 million
snapchat users have had their user names
and phone numbers exposed if you want to
see if you've been affected you can go
to ww snapchat org and enter your
username or password to see if you're
one of the 4.6 million who have been
affected the funny thing is the blog
said the exploit could be fixed by
altering all of 10 lines of code to make
matters worse they've known about the
exploit for four months and never fixed
it if you use snapchat we recommend you
keep an eye out until the exploit gets
fixed Jedi Academy was a popular action
game from 2003 that was good for a
myriad of reasons including excellent
gameplay in the immediate use of
lightsabers if you like that game and
want to play it again you can now get it
on Android it's not a straight port like
you'd see with other games it's just the
game engine that's been ported and in
order to play the game you must also
have the pc version it's a dollar
ninety-five for the app and 699 for the
pc version on Steam currently so you'll
need about nine bucks to get everything
up and running once everything is
downloaded you just copy a few files
from the pc version to your device and
it's ready to go in case you happen to
miss that we at android authority
released our list of the best
applications of 2013 this also included
the worst apps and the most
controversial applications and also some
categories like best design and best
design video game we had a lot of fun
doing it and of course we encourage our
readers to tell us some of their
favorite apps of 2013 so you can see
what other people liked and disliked as

up this week is a brand new application
called recollect in the style that has
become popular and Android recollect
takes a fairly old concept like to do
lists and improves the design by such a
degree that it feels like a new
experience how it works is you put
something on the list and a place where
that thing will take place then when you
show up at that place your phone will
remind you it's pretty nice check it out
the drastic recently got a huge update
to not only fix some bugs and improve
performance but also added some much
needed support for moga controllers and
the KitKat art runtime it still it's had
expensive at 599 but it's far and wide
the best DS emulator available right now

it before you buy it the popular Twitter

in this huge update there is a totally
redesigned user interface and a host of
new features including redesigned

reason not to give it a shot and it does
look quite nice reddit is fun is one of

to make things better that said one note

a new widget the ability to share web
content finally multi window mode and
