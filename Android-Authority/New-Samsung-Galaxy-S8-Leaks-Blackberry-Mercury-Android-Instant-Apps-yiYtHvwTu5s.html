referred to using an AI assistant like
they did in Star Trek but now amazon
Alexa can change their call name from
Alexa to computer hello computer and the
samsung galaxy s 8 rumors keep rolling
it this image was posted by the de for
design Twitter account and shows to
display shells that are supposed to be
for the galaxy s 8 and the larger si+
both look like they have curved screens
with very little bezel they also both
look like the smartphone mock-up that
was used in the recent videos with
Samsung's display division android
police also points out that multiple
sensor windows on both of the display
shells may indicate that the galaxy s 8
could have features like iris scanning
that was included in the aborted galaxy
note 7 in any case bear in mind that
this image has not been confirmed by
Samsung as of yet and it could just be a
clever mock-up now moving on to more
specific Android news imagine for a
moment if you could use an app's
functionality without having to actually
open up the app at all confused while
that's the promise of Android instant
apps android instant apps was first
revealed to us at Google i/o 2016 but as
a quick refresher once a user taps on an
Android instant app link the google play
store will begin to deliver only enough
code for the app to run on the android
device without having to actually open
up the app at all this concept seems
like it could be really helpful
especially if you're only planted to use
the app one time to handle a certain
task android instant apps can also be
downloaded via NFC connection in case
you needed to buy a ticket directly from
a concert hall kiosk or you wanted to
pay one of those internet-connected
parking meters now having to go in and
out of individual apps for one or two
tasks is clumsy and clunky so I think
this is promising it may not be in this
exact format but I think it has a future
google has promised that they're going
to roll out android instant apps to
certain apps as a beta test like
BuzzFeed wish
periscope and blackberry is throwing us
another Hail Mary and I want to be
hopeful but it sort of feels like hoping
the maple leafs win the Stanley Cup
nonetheless it is official blackberry
will show off its QWERTY keyboard
sporting mercury smartphone on februari
2015 right at the beginning of the
Mobile World Congress 2017 now we were
able to get a hands-on with a very early
pre-production unit at CES 2017 which
allowed us to get a good feel for the
phone before blackberry and TLC put
their finishing touches on it while the
software on the phone wasn't nearly
finished the hardware felt extremely
solid with a qwerty keyboard in tow
blackberry is seemingly pulling out all
the stops with Mercury it sports a
fingerprint sensor embedded in the
phone's physical space bar USB type-c
connectivity and you can also take
advantage of gestures on the keyboard to
swipe through menus on the phone and
since this is a blackberry the mercury
will be geared towards enterprise
customers but will also be sold unlocked
for other customers too I got to admit I
think it's all too little too late but
proved me wrong please what do you think
in the comments below does BlackBerry's
mercury have a shot what do you think so
why do I love our new sponsor ting
because ting saves you cash ting is a
mobile phone service that is helping
people like you save a lot of money on
their monthly cell phone bills ting is
not just lowering their mobile data
rates across the board but you also just
pay for what you use with ting and that
now also includes data for just ten
dollars per gigabyte visit aah encom and
see how much you can save with ting and
on top of that you'll get twenty-five
dollars towards your first device or
tang service
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
