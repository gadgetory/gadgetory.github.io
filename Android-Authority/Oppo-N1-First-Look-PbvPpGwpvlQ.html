well-received find five-o po is out with
another one that thinks bigger and
somewhat outside the box aides Josh
freghar from Android Authority what's
going on everybody and this is our first
look at the Oppo n1 Oppo was gracious
enough to bring me out to their launch
event in Beijing and after a spirited
presentation I got my hands on the new
5.9 inch large n1 after their great find
five seeing another big release from
Oppo was definitely an exciting prospect
what we're looking at here is a much
larger phone that said squarely in the
phablet space basically right alongside
the Sony Xperia Z ultra and someone
beyond to the Samsung Galaxy Note range
this is an aluminum clad phone but in
the hand it has a soft touch it
basically feels like to find five in
terms of its contact with the skin and
aside from its larger size it is
actually still pretty easy to grip Oppo
has really made design one of its
biggest priorities and in the
presentation they made a big deal of the
fact that all of the ports have been
brought down to the bottom to ensure all
the other sides remain very sleek the
button layout is all on the right side
and brought halfway down in order to
make it easier to access the bright IPS
screen does its job well bringing a very
bright 1080p experience to this large
screen that should please all of those
media junkies out there when you come
down the back you get the all white
background with the opal logo but when
you look closely there is a small square
area that has some edging on it this is
the AU touch area which is one of the N
ones innovations with the phone as big
as this navigation might be quite
difficult especially in one hand and
oboe wanted to make life easier by
putting a touch-sensitive area on the
back that you can use your index finger
on to navigate plenty of functions are
available like swiping among home
screens tapping to take pictures and
more should come as the SDK is made
available to app developers for now it's
a thoughtful but admittedly rather
limited feature but it should grow as
time goes on but the two biggest stories
regarding this device are the ones that
you notice right away not only is this a
much larger phone than many of us might
be used to with that 5.9 inch screen the
camera way up top brings a modern take
to an old gimmick rotation yes the
speaker grille and the rear facing
camera have been put together into one
movable unit thus allowing you to have
the rear facing camera move forward to
become your front-facing camera
with all angles in between possible for
shooting as well the camera has to flash
diodes that work in congruence to get
you either a softer or stronger light
depending on your circumstances so not
only is the n1 doing away with subpar
front-facing cameras by allowing you to
use the rear camera it is also opening
up possibilities for you to capture
pictures from many possible angles there
advertisement showcasing this was nice
but it also served as an example of how
creepy it might be to have this kind of
freedom but I guess it's up to you to
decide on that one underneath the hood
Oppo opted to put in the Snapdragon 600
processor that clocks in at 1.7
gigahertz backed by the audrina 320 the
user interface did move along very
smoothly and we saw no hiccups so even
if benchmarks put it below the faster
Snapdragon 800 devices out there it can
still sit among them in actual usage
there is no expandable storage for the
16 or 32 gigabytes available and here
are a few quick shots from the camera
taken in the pretty dimly lit room I was
in with an aperture of F to the camera
is already equipped with low-light tools
and thus did well under these
circumstances the rotation in the camera
unit might make some users wary of its
overall longevity but Oppo claims that
it will withstand a long long time of
movements one of the bundled accessories
with the n1 is a small module called the
oak click this is a small but still
attractive looking button that has a few
different functions it mainly is able to
remotely snap a picture if you put the
phone down for say a group shot but also
is a two-way phone locator device and
finally in software we were all waiting
with bated breath to hear about the
CyanogenMod partnership unfortunately
information was quite sparse as they
definitely announced the partnership but
stopped short of giving further
information one of the main questions
was if Opel was going to continue with
its own operating system this was
answered pretty emphatically with the
unveiling of the color OS so this is how
it's basically going to work Opel units
thus far will come with the color OS
installed but the CM ROM will be bundled
along with instructions on how to
install or flash it a special edition of
the n1 with CyanogenMod pre-installed is
in the works but will see a limited
release as far as color OS goes it is
very similar to the OS that we saw in
defined 5 with a couple new features
mainly support for gestures that are put
in via a new drop-down that you can
access by dragging down from the
top-left corner it is nice to see Oppo
continuing with their own
were endeavors but the CyanogenMod
announcement definitely propels them
into more Western audiences all of whom
should be paying more attention to the
fast-growing Oppo if they haven't
already and so there you have it
the Oppo n1 is quite the endeavor from a
Chinese manufacturer that somewhat
surprised but definitely pleased all of
us would then find five once we get our
hands on a unit for a full review make
sure you check it out as we are
definitely excited to put the n1 through
its paces until then stay tuned to
android authority for all of the best
coverage because we're your source for
