phone and you should be so is it iris
scanners fingerprint scanners or pass
codes what's the best way to lock it
down now I know it's pretty self-evident
but first we got to talk about the
difference between biometric and non
biometric data non biometric data is
your password your passcode that you use
to lock down your smartphone biometric
data is when you are your password
whether that's through your fingerprint
or your iris or through some other
biometric means we use to prove our
identity to our phone now for a
smartphone biometric security works like
this you first begin by providing a
biological sample that is digitized and
then stored as read-only information on
the device as you may have guessed it's
stored as read-only so it prevents the
information from being compromised and
when you need to gain access to your
device you have to provide another
biological sample that is checked
against the sample that is stored
initially if the samples match you've
proven your identity and gain access but
if your sample does not match you've
been unable to verify your identity and
therefore get denied now some of you
might be thinking why not just use a pin
code or password which must simpler and
faster right well in some ways they are
inherently less secure this is because
there is only a finite number of
possible alphanumeric combinations that
can be used for any given password so a
hacker with enough time and tenacity
could in theory figure out your password
through a process of elimination or
through a program that he or she writes
or else a potential attacker could watch
you input your password or pattern and
after gaining access to your device
attempt to follow along with your
movements to satisfy your device's
authentification requirements granted
there are ways to mitigate this somewhat
including by putting a limited number of
times in which an incorrect password can
be entered but this type of precaution
is far from absolute for this reason
fingerprint sensors are all the rage
right now and becoming a standard
feature even in mid to low range mobile
devices now I know what some of you are
thinking you're thinking Jace I have a
thing
fantastic password it cannot be guessed
by anybody it's not simple super
complicated with special characters
capitals just crazy stuff
no one's gonna hack that thing or guess
it well let's hear from an expert this
is bill burr a former manager at the
National Institute of Standards and
Technology no not that bill Berger in
2003 burr created an 8 page guide that
would go on to inform the password
creating guidelines but which we all are
forced to abide by today but Bert
recently came clean and admitted that he
had a very poor understanding of how
passwords actually worked at the time
and he's very sorry that his misguided
treaty is the reason we must make these
unnecessarily complicated passwords that
don't make our devices or accounts any
more secure we now know that using a
string of simple and unrelated words is
actually more secure than using a
shorter password in which there is a
mix-up of upper and lower case letters
numbers and special characters there was
a well-known comic strip that explains
this best illustrating how a computer
could take 550 years or at least 1,000
guesses per minute to figure out a
password consisting of four simple words
like correct horse battery staple while
something like rub four or and three
would just take three days at the same
rate now there is a saving grace for
alphanumeric passwords and I know you're
gonna groan because it's a pain in the
butt
it is two-factor authentication
basically rather than immediately
granting entry with the input of your
password two-factor authentication means
that input of your password will trigger
a one-time temporary code to be sent to
you typically a numeric code sent via
text message or a phone call and you can
only gain entry once you've inputted the
temporary code in the login window
now what about patterns is that any
better one of the biggest issues with
patterns is that others can watch your
finger moves across the devices display
to decipher your pattern it's
particularly easy since there are only
nine points on your device giving
hackers a much better chance of figuring
out your pattern than if they were
trying to detect the letters you were
hitting on a keyboard for an
alphanumeric password and almost half
the lock screens started in the upper
left-hand corner according to some data
so that means that biometric security
must be inherently more secure correct
well to some degree yes when it comes to
fingerprint sensors it creates a virtual
image of your fingerprint by inferring
the pattern from the different levels of
a charge between the ridges and valleys
of your print while something like an
optical fingerprint scanner can be
fooled with a high-resolution photo of
your fingerprint capacitive scanners are
more secure because they measure the
actual physical structure of your
fingerprint as such using your
fingerprint to secure your device is
probably going to be the most secure
method available to you but how secure
is it really well not even biometric
security is completely infallible in
fact kyle lady senior R&amp;amp;D engineer of
dual security doesn't consider biometric
security on smartphones to be really any
better than non biometric security
methods according to Kyle biometric
technology on smartphones represents a
shift mostly in accessibility and offers
quote a different set of properties to
passwords not better or worse but
different how is that possible you ask
well a professor at University of Oxford
professor Rogers had his students
attempt to fool each other's
authentication methods available on
smartphones accordingly they have
managed to best every single one
including fingerprint sensors for no
more than the cost of a cup of coffee
during a conversation we had with
Professor Rogers he explains how they
manage to trick the fingerprint sensor
which they did with so-called gummy
fingers basically gummy fingers our
fingerprint replica is made of rubbery
silicon like materials that are able to
capture significant fingerprint detail
in order to fool the capacitive sensor
which of course leaves us with facial
recognition and iris scanners while the
consensus seems to be that facial
recognition isn't quite in the same
league as fingerprint sensors when it
comes to biometric authentication
because facial recognition can often be
circumvented with a photograph god this
is starting to sound like a doomsday
show it's not meant to be that way the
point is is that no security system is
infallible anything can be
but on the other hand as we progress it
is getting harder and harder to hack
these systems case in point I know there
was a big scandal I did a show about it
after the sa was hacked like a month
after it launched but come on that
German team put a lot of effort in
hacking that most people are not going
to be troubled going through that much
hassle to hack your particular phone so
use your common sense what do you think
about your fingerprint scanner your PIN
code your passcode your iris scanners I
know I've seen some people use facial
recognition where family members are
using the facial recognition to get into
a family member's phone has that
happened to you let me know in the
comments below now my audience is smart
so smart that sometimes you're inspired
by a business idea and then you try and
get the name of that business in a
domain name and your next prospective
customer is searching your business name
and they assume you have the dot-com and
if you don't you're giving your business
away to the one who does that's the
power of accom now why is that exactly
well no domain name extension tells your
story with the same degree of trust as a
dot-com or dotnet domain name.com and
dotnet domain name extensions and jet
credibility and your online presence and
who doesn't want to be credible and
don't forget you get 15% off when you
