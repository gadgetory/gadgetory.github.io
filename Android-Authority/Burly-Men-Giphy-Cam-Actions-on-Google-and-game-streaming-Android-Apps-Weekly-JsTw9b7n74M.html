Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly this
is episode number 161 so let's get
started the google play store is
apparently rolling out a new feature
that lets you stream games before you
buy them it should be rolling out over
the next couple of weeks for now it's
only available on a few devices and for
a few games the premise is that you get
a 10 minute window to play the game
before you buy it so you can see what
it's like first it's a fit buggy
according to reports but it's a neat
little feature that may help people buy
more games the once popular driver game
carmageddon released an update this week
that made it completely free the caveat
there is that every version of the game
now has advertising even if players
previously bought the game to avoid the
ads the ads that show now are for
carmageddon max damage which is their
latest xbox one and ps4 title the
advertising could be a lot worse but we
understand why it could make some people
upset word on the digital street is that
the google cast application is about to
undergo yet another evolution starting
soon the application will go by the name
of google home and it'll be an
application that helps you connect with
your chromecast and withdrew google home
device at least that's what we're
assuming since it kind of brings all of
their streaming devices under one
umbrella keep an eye out for the update
which should be rolling out sooner or
later Samsung is apparently looking to
re-enter the digital assistant space
with their acquisition of viv labs for
those who don't know viv Labs is a
startup that specializes in digital
assistants and it's also worth noting
that the creators helped build Siri
we're not entirely certain how Samsung
is going to use their acquisition but
the popular opinion is that they'll
compete with Syrian Google in the years
to come here's hoping it does better
than s voice did along with all of the
new hardware google also announced
actions on google this week which will
give third-party developers the chance
to integrate their applications directly
with google assistant there are two
types of actions one is called direct
while the other is called conversational
direct actions are simple one phrase
commands conversational actions or
interactions that require more than one
command or additional input from the
user there are some big names like
Netflix and I of TTT on board already
and we can't wait to see how all of that
turns out
dan the man is the latest game out of
Halfbrick Studios makers of the popular
Fruit Ninja and Jetpack Joyride it's an
action platformer that will have you
jumping around killing bad guys avoiding
obstacles and taking on tough bosses
he'll also have weapons and upgradable
attacks daily events to earn rewards and
plenty of secret areas beaming with
extra treasure it's a freemium game so
there are some pitfalls here and there
however with the extra game modes and
plenty of content it's a title that's
worth checking out IV is a sidebar
application that allows you to pop open
a sidebar to access your favorite apps
it works kind of like the edge feature
on the Galaxy s7 edge where you swipe in
from the side and it'll open the bar you
can configure which applications go in
that space and you can even have an RSS
feed that pops up from the bottom there
are other configurations that you can
make as well it's a bit buggy which is
normal for early releases but it's worth
keeping on your radar burly men at sea
is a beautifully done storybook game
that takes place in 20th century
Scandinavia you'll play as 3 ungainly
heroes who have set off on a journey for
adventure the game is fairly short but
it's actually supposed to be according
to the developers you're supposed to
play through the game once and then play
through multiple times to find all of
the various parts of the branching story
it features simple graphics and engaging
storyline and best of all no in-app
purchases giphy cam is a jif camera that
allows you to create your own gifs the
application will take several
photographs in birth form and then
string them together in order to form
your jiff from there you'll be able to
decorate it with buttons stickers
filters and other special effects as a
jiff camera it's actually pretty good
compared to its competition even if its
special effects aren't really that great
it's a free application with no in-app
purchases if you want to give it a shot
for yourself legend of the skyfish is an
adventure puzzle game that is similar in
mechanics to games like Legend of Zelda
you'll play as Little Red Hook and along
with your fishing pole you'll conquer
puzzles defeat bad guys and ostensibly
catch some fish it features 45 levels
grappling hook mechanics with your
fishing pole and quaint hand-drawn style
graphics there is also gamepad support
if you need that it's a pay once game
with no in-app purchases for even more
