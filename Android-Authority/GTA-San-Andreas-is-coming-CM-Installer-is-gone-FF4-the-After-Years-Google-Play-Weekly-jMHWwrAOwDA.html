Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Google Play weekly in
this week's episode we're going to talk
about the CM installer leaving the
Google Play Store final fantasy for the
after years GTA san andreas some
chromecast stuff and a lot more so let's
get started first up this week of
cyanogen mod installer after a few
successful weeks in the Google Play
Store Google has asked the cyanogenmod
removed the installer from the Google
Play Store as you can imagine
cyanogenmod complied immediately and it
has made a speedy exit from the google
play store and some people have claimed
that if cyanogen mod installer should be
out than other root apps should be as
well there is however a huge difference
between it and other root apps in the
Google Play Store other apps require
that you already have root access before
you can use it whereas CM installer
actually does the dirty deed itself
which voids the warranty you can still
side load the application which is
available on cyanogenmod org so it is
still out there last week we brought you
news the google play store has made that
final transition into separating tablet
and phone applications this week they
continue to improve as they now have
this section for chromecast ready apps
as you can imagine the selection is
fairly small right now but the
chromecast is still a relatively new
platform developers are working hard in
Google is slowly allowing for more and
more features also for a limited time
you get six dollars worth of play store
credit when you buy a chromecast to help
you find some good apps for it grand
theft auto san andreas is one of the
best GTA s' ever it raised the bar for
sandbox games higher than it had ever
been before and good news it's coming to
android the release date is set sometime
in December although we don't know which
day exactly the good news is the game
has been reworked to be playable and
Android devices and it has full
controller support the bad news is it
will only be available for select
devices at launch we assume that means
the most recent ones but we won't know
for sure until it's actually out many of
us were expecting Google to do a little
bit more with a pops in android 4.4
unfortunately that functionality still
isn't ready yet so it's still hidden
within the u.s. now there is an
application that lets you use a pops on
Android KitKat for those who don't know
or don't remember app ops lets you
configure permissions for your
applications manually so you can for
instance prevent facebook from using its
location permission without ruining any
of its other permissions the app is free
to use with in-app purchases and
remember to be careful turning off
permissions can break some application
the chief cast is an increasingly
popular application that allows you to
castings to your Android device which
essentially turns it into a chromecast
in a recent update it has edit support
for google chrome tab casting this means
that you can cast tabs from your chrome
browser directly to your android device
some uses for this include viewing flash
content on unsupported Android browsers
or just using your device as a
chromecast connected device instead of
your television so who wants to see some
trending applications as usual if you
want to try any of these apps out the
links are in the written companion in
the video description first up is Final
Fantasy for the after years this is the
sequel to the critically acclaimed Final
Fantasy 4 and has been ported to android
Square Enix has been improving their
offerings with each new release and this
one is no exception there are faster
battles quicker gameplay and less clunky
controls along with a full story and
that makes this game worth looking into
warning it is a little bit expensive
espn's app scorecenter has finally been
bumped up to the iconic sports center
and with it came a lot of changes these
include a reduced number of
advertisements faster performance more
targeted team new support real-time
scores for nearly all sports and
improved alerts it's definitely a step
up from what it used to be the
doubletwist has updated their app
offering it now features a redesigned
you I including support for 7-inch and
10-inch tablets also included are some
functionality and graphic improvements
like better playlist management and
better album and artist art if you're
looking for a new music player give this
one a shot it is free newegg has updated
their mobile application it was already
pretty good but they now have support
for mobile specific deals since we are
now officially in the holiday season
mobile deals can offer some great stuff
for cheap and what nerd doesn't like
that possibility amazon has been working
hard to improve their app lately and the
latest update has been pretty big you
can now shop with points redeemed gift
cards and connect bank accounts to pay
for things Canadian Amazon customers can
now look at lightning deals and of
course the boilerplate bug fixes and
performance improvements once again I'm
