the best of the past and bring it into
the present
aah Strasbourg are from Android 30
what's going on everybody and this is
the Oppo find 7 in this first look as
should be evidenced by the usage of the
find name this is an update to the
original find 5 that was also a bit of a
trailblazer in its own right as it was
one of the first phones to come with a
1080p resolution display that tradition
continues here on the fine 7 as it comes
with an industry-first 1440p display not
called 2k by the company but instead
quad HD but before we get into the
absolutely jaw-dropping screen let's
talk about the design the design of the
fine 7 follows heavily from the language
originally started in the fine 5 which
is a wonderfully constructed body with
steel elements in the fine 7 and the
first thing that was noticed was a much
better balanced weight distribution as
well the fine 7 comes a little bit
heavier than its predecessor it feels
much nimbler in the hands than we would
have expected the black slate front has
the 5.5 inch screen with capacitive keys
on the bottom accompanied underneath by
a very attractive LED notification light
called the skyline notification light
the shine goes from the very middle of
the area and permeates in a curve
throughout the bottom of the phone the
button layout takes on the power button
on the left with the volume rockers on
the right another returning feature from
the fine 5 and at first the uncommon
layout does take a little getting used
to coming around the back you will
notice that there are two different
backs in this video as the phone comes
in two different versions called the
find 7a or light there's a version that
sports a 1080p HD display instead and
includes somewhat lowered specifications
that will have a brushed backing that
does feel quite nice but is a bit
slippery to the touch the version
sporting the quad HD display instead has
a carbon-fiber backing that definitely
feels more secure in the hand and has an
attractive textured pattern either
version will make your phone that looks
absolutely great even more so in the
white version if that is your preference
now 5.5 inches is in quite a common size
for a phone screen as phone
manufacturers are starting to stretch
the limits of 5 inch form factors with
5.1 and 5.2 inch offerings nowadays and
then you have the larger phablet space
that can range from five point seven to
the six point four instead oppan went
for the middle route and thus has a
phone that does have
a 5.5 inch screen but has the general
size of a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 the
result is a phone that is right on the
line of discomfort when using one-handed
it's nowhere near the discomfort of a
full-sized phablet and its form factor
we believe will gradually feel normal to
most users though the sides are rather
thin the flatness allows for a good
enough grip that things never get out of
hand
the screen is one of the biggest stories
here with its 2k or quad HD resolution
coming in at 2560 by 1440 and has the
highest pixel density of any device in
the world currently at 534 pixels per
inch thus bringing the first display
experience of its kind you can go to
Android Authority comm and see our
examples of the differences between this
and 1080p resolution screens which all
lead to the same conclusion the fine 7
is incredibly sharp
well while under a microscope it might
be easier to see how much more packed
the pixels are to the general users eye
it's a certainty thus that the viewing
experience will be highly enjoyable
elbow is really showing their display
pedigree with the fine 7 and it was
honestly one of the most photogenic
screens I have had the pleasure to film
and photograph if you already have a
great time with 1080p displays then that
will simply just continue here with all
Poe's latest but once again remember to
head to Android Authority comm for an
even closer look underneath the hood we
get different versions of the five-seven
once again as the 1080p phone will come
with the Snapdragon 800 and the quad HD
performer will support the Snapdragon
801 and 3 gigabytes of RAM the color OS
while not necessarily considered
minimalistic in its feature set actually
flew by very smoothly in either version
we tested making this phone sit among
its competition in terms of sheer
performance for the most part the only
thing really hindering our speedy
experience on the fine 7 was having to
hold down the home button to access the
recent apps screen and in terms of
hardware Oppo wanted to step their game
up even further by offering expandable
storage underneath that removable back
and as far as connectivity goes this is
the first Oppo smartphone to handle LTE
connections as it will be made available
in every markets version of the phone
that's a big deal for anyone otherwise
sick of OPOs HSDPA connectivity
available on previous offerings but the
biggest story in hardware here is
definitely in regards to the battery
3000 milliamp hours might sound pretty
normal
for the 1440p phone but Alpo has built
in a technology allowing for what is
called multi-step constant current
charging now that all sounds like
technical talk but here's the gist elbow
claims that the phone can go from 0 to
75 percent battery life in half an hour
bottom line is you're looking at the
best-in-class charging speeds of any
smart phone we're excited to put it to
the test but in the end faster charging
time is an exciting prospect indeed
moving into the camera we have a 13
megapixel optic package powered by the
latest generation sony exmor RS sensor
the result is a photography experience
that is greatly enhanced but still feels
pretty familiar the app is very much the
same color OS app from the n1 that
includes a lot of different options for
your photography experience including
some surprises like the ability to shoot
in RAW format as well as a few returning
features like a slow shutter capture I
turned on the touch to capture feature
and found the app very snappy getting
its focus point very quickly and then
going from shutter to file in very
little time and during our first glance
the pictures all looked quite nice but
our full review will really put it
through its paces so stay tuned for that
and finally we'll talk about the
software as we have the color OS that
returns from the Oppo n1 while we were
told the new version of this operating
system is definitely on its way the
color OS is already pretty feature
packed from the top down on the home
screens there are the live media widgets
for extra fun despite some interesting
shaped choices here and there the
general experience is what you would
expect especially with the color OS
being one of the few Asian user
interfaces that still uses an app drawer
dive deeper into the experience however
and you'll be sure to find plenty of
little gems that range from gimmicky to
incredibly useful the useful features
include the gesture panel that will that
you can bring down by sliding from the
left of the drop down and in there you
can draw any number of programmable
gestures to perform a bunch of different
tasks these can actually be triggered
while in standby mode as well double
tapping the home button can then turn
off and wake up the phone which was
another highlight but the more gimmicky
features are still really cool like the
sky gestures which can be triggered by
holding the volume button down and then
moving the phone about in a certain
pattern to turn it the camera or the
torch on over all the rather ethereal
look of the color OS
but it is really only a cover of an
otherwise very feature heavy and
actually incredibly thoughtful
experience found underneath the Oppo
find 7 will go on sale very soon on
their website for various markets under
the prices of $4.99 for the 1080p
resolution version and then $5.99 for
the quad HD version and so there you
have it the Oppo find 7 in this pretty
extended first look we spend quite a bit
of time with the phone and the wonderful
people over at Oppo and there is really
one thing for certain after our time
with it we can't wait to get our hands
on it for an even more in depth review

Beijing China this is Josh of agar from
