last month I got the chance to see the
launch of the yotaphone to add some
brief time with the device and now I
finally got my hands on it I'm excited
to see just how good this device is
outside of the showroom and whether that
novelty this e-ink display
still exists outside of that space so
today we are going to take a look at the
yotaphone to the design of the yotaphone
to surprises me there are no markings
adorning the front of the device which
immediately gives a more sophisticated
look which is personally what I like to
see on devices the glass that sits on it
is flat but the surrounding frame and
the shape of the phone accentuates this
flatness the whole device sees curves
everywhere the top bottom sides and back
the device has a shallow great urn ality
too and this fits in well with what is
your two phone twos headline feature the
rear always-on eating display the bezel
and back blend into the matte eating
display well and makes the whole
presentation look natural for something
that's quite unnatural if someone saw
the back of the device it could easily
be mistaken for the front whilst it does
feel better holding it the normal way up
it doesn't feel bad holding it upside
down
the device has a magnesium chassis with
a glass fiber reinforced plastic outer
surface both panels are covered in
Corning Gorilla Glass 3 which should
prove useful for the rear display as it
will be the side most susceptible to
scratches and scuffs the yotaphone 2
comes in at eight point nine five
millimeters at its thickest point one
hundred and forty four point nine
millimeters tall and 69 point four
millimeters wide this all results in the
device weighing in at 145 grams the
Nexus 5 here is a good comparison as the
two phones are very similar in terms of
size the Nexus 5 is eight point six
millimeters thin and comes in a 130
grams an imperceptible difference for
something good to compare to regardless
looking around the device we have the
headphone port at the top the left hand
side is void of any buttons or markings
on the right hand side we have the
standby button and above that we have
the volume rocker which in this case
doubles as the nano SIM card slot this
may be a technical justification for
having a screen on the back but the
resulting effect is a slight machinist
to the button presses to sum this may
not matter but coming from ceramic keys
on the Nexus 4
five there is a tangible difference
finally we have a single speaker on the
bottom even though there are grills
indicating too which is a shame really
and we're left with the micro USB
connection to finish it off there is no
denying that Yoda have done a good job
incorporating two screens into a device
that feels remarkably similar to nearly
every other phone out there to display
on the yotaphone to well two displays
are both good the front panel is an
adequately bright five inch full HD
AMOLED display the white balance is not
too cold nor too warm which is good and
thusly provides a good experience but it
does slightly lean towards a green tin
the Nexus 5 again in comparison is
slightly more red there is no color
shift at extreme angles and the
yotaphone 2 only shows the slightest or
contrast shifts at these extreme angles
it's a pleasing experience overall but
I'm sure you're interested to hear about
the e-ink display modern smartphones and
their screens use a lot of power so the
4.5 inch e-ink touchscreen display
should make for a highly efficient one
as it only uses power when refreshing
the panel comes in at 960 by 540 with 16
levels of grayscale which in this case
is surprisingly crisp the concept of
having two screens on the phone feels
unnatural and will take a bit of getting
used to you also recommend using the
e-ink panel as much as possible to save
that much more battery life but this
will require a change of habit this
change wouldn't be as jarring if it
weren't for the refresh rate and the
responsiveness of the ink display it's
good but it's slow and can feel slow to
register presses and for those presses
to even take effect more often than not
you also get that flicker the slowness
doesn't bother me so much but here
you're trying to use the back panel as
if it was the front and that hurts the
display we have some expectations using
devices in this sort of manner it's a
trade off at the end of the day and I'm
sure yota
had to balance design and usability
despite any usability issues with the
e-ink display it still looks great
pictures look great especially black and
white images and yo to have done well to
manipulate the display to make it work
with the rear panel a word of warning
though the display won't be sufficient
for those looking to do anything more
than reading or using slower paced apps
watching videos and playing games won't
be a good experience at all the e-ink
display works best if you're using for
glanceable info and notifications you
can answer call check to see
you have an emails text and it's
surprising how good that feature is
especially when such a technology is
based around the ecosystem of your phone
the best part of these eating displays
that it works great outdoors long have
we lived for this powering the two
displays we have the Snapdragon 800
running at 2.2 gigahertz the phone has
two gigs of ram and comes standard with
32 gigabytes of storage it's a curious
choice for sure but it doesn't hurt the
device as the phone runs fine most of
the time one cue is hit - the
performance was the keyboard trying to
type often resulted in some sort of lag
which queued up a bunch of characters if
it wasn't that then it was the incorrect
detection of keys often thinking I was
swiping or typing something else when I
wasn't even after trying different
keyboards the problem persisted even on
the ink panel via yota mirror given the
hardware of this device it should be
more than capable so I don't
particularly understand why this was
happening it's a displeasing as impacts
a very nature of using a smart phone
hopefully this can be addressed in an
update contrastingly enough everything
else works just as you'd expect it to
the system runs well and fluid with the
app switching being snappy
thankfully the hardwood components have
a pretty vanilla build of Android to
play with and for it it's pretty speedy
with no OEM skin weighing it down we
have Android 4.4.3 here and yota have
set Android 5.0 we'll be coming at a
later date
it should be exciting to see what
updates will see a regard to the back
panel the phone comes with only a
minimal amount of app bloatware which is
thankfully all removable the rest of the
apps are taken up by otos own suite of
apps designed for the e-ink panel we
have yota RSS which works there feedly
this chess checkers sodoku 2048 and
finally there's yota reader this
supports epubs text files but not PDFs
which was slightly disappointing it's
not all bad as you can use any app that
you want through what yo to call your to
mirror this essentially passes the
screen through to the rear link panel
you'll lose some detail in the
conversion but this way you can bypass
any limitations of the applications that
yota provide even though the apps aren't
tailored for the e-ink display it's a
good function that increases the
usability of the device however if you
use an app that requires a lot of
refreshing you may end up using more
battery life than you would with the
front panel
these yota snap which takes a screenshot
and send it straight to the back via a
swipe gesture from the navbar
datian is good and works well which
could really help you should you need
some information to stay the nice thing
about this is that as with anything
using the e-ink display is that whatever
you send will stay there even if the
battery dies you also calls this life
after death
there's yota energy which is a battery
saver mode that cleverly utilizes the
e-ink display in a way that all the
phones can't it limits the CPU frequency
terms of every wireless radio lowers the
brightness and more yota claim that with
yota energy on the last 15 percent of
your battery life is equal to 8.5 hours
of operation I tested this with 10
percent battery and it lasted me six
further hours not bad going finally
there's the yota hub which consists of
yota covers and yota panels yota covers
add a nice sense of personalization to
the phone and what is essentially a lock
screen you can get to this by tapping
the icon on the bottom to quickly bring
the cover down this addresses the
always-on nature of the display in an
easy-to-use manner which should please
those that are concerned with the
privacy of this device I mean it's
superficial but the small ability to
display whatever you want as your
permanent image shows a nice difference
to the current sea of devices out there
yota panels offer glanceable widgets and
shortcut to contacts and other apps that
are made and rendered for the e-ink
technology you have up to four screens
with varied grid size presets to
customize problem is you can only see
what widgets are available once you've
chosen your grid size meaning if you
want to have another widget you have to
go back and change the good size it's
all a bit unintuitive on the plus side
having these apps makes logical and
essential sense for the rear display
elevating it from merely just a panel to
something offering genuine cases of
usability during a launch event I was
told that there would be an SDK
available so far we have seen an
official Twitter widget which works on a
yota panel I only hope that this SDK
will be pushed forward as the software
is only good as the apps and the
functions available for it we have a
good start and whilst his technology
isn't quite perfect yet
this device can really carve out
something for yourself contrastingly I
did encounter a few odd issues namely I
could unlock the front screen with a
swipe gesture mimicking the unlock
action that you use on the rear Inca
panel the issue was sporadic but it kept
reoccurring there's no mention of this
anywhere as an intended feature so I'm
inclined to believe this is a bug moving
on to the rest of the phone there isn't
much left to say as the phone is pretty
the camera we have in the yotaphone 2 is
an 8 megapixel shooter which is lower
than the 12 which was found on its
predecessor I'm not sure whether this is
an actual downgrade or if it's a better
sensor there's a 2.1 megapixel front
facing camera but you may find yourself
not using it much due to yota mirror
with the rear display you can use the
main camera as a front-facing camera due
to the ability to cast the main display
to the rear panel this allows you to
shoot a better picture otherwise when
you're using the camera normally the
rear display will display a nice smile
the sound on the yotaphone 2 is poor but
that's in comparison to today's
standards fortunately it's not as bad as
a speaker on my Nexus 5 which I've never
really liked the audio is louder doesn't
clip and has a touch more depth
we have a 2500 milliamp battery supply
the power to the yotaphone to battery
life was always going to be a point of
contention given the REO Inc panel
suffice to say the phone topped out at
around 3 hours and 55 minutes on a video
loop playing 1080p via software decode
on full brightness in general use I
averaged about eight hours of battery
life I'm less inclined to use the phone
though partly due to the phone offering
very little but also because I'm using
the Eco panel more I'm checking my phone
many times a day and most of that can
easily be replaced by the e-ink panel
this is no doubt saved a lot of battery
life the yotaphone 2 is made with a
unique screen I have to commend yota on
making it into a really nice and neat
little package this is a great selling
point but choosing to have components
from a passion aeration a satisfactory
camera and audio capabilities which are
only a touch above disappointing I find
it really really surprising just to see
how high that price point really is yota
are asking for five hundred and fifty
five pounds yes and in Europe it will be
699 euros for example you could buy a
nexus 5 which is essentially the same
SPECT phone and a Kindle all for 338
pounds sure it doesn't have the
integration of dual screens but I don't
think it deserves the premium they're
asking for even still I'd like to see
this phone out there I want to see it
being used by developers as I believe
there is some real potential with this
concept it's on sale now in 20 countries
in Europe the CIS and the Middle East
later in 2015 they'll slowly be
launching in other markets such as Asia
the USA Canada and Latin America to be
honest it's a good device but I can't
help but think that this would be
nothing without the e-ink panel the
phone itself is pretty basic and doesn't
offer anything new or even relatively
interesting you may find yourself using
the ink panel on the back and being
quite happy with what the technology can
offer not necessarily this particular
implementation but the rest of the phone
needs to be just as good if not better
so that both feature sets can provide an
attractive package the ink display is a
nice one it works well with 16 levels of
greyscale static pictures and texts look
great I mean it's just awesome having a
screener is always on and uses
very little battery life the software
controlling this is slightly more
restrictive than I initially thought
small touches has been able to change
the four icons on the dock would be a
star the potential here is really large
and I just hope this SDK is pushed
forward as more apps and customizations
will only help this sort of technology
it's not as intuitive as it should be
the refresh rate and latency was never
really going to work well when using it
like a normal phone it requires a
different form of usage that and the
previous niggles I mentioned earlier I
hope will be sold by future software
updates from yota but hey at the end of
the day is all going to be down to just
what you're looking for and if these
features run well with you and you can
live with some of the idiosyncrasies of
the device and I think that yotaphone 2
will be a good choice it's a well-made
phone when overall represents a very
good idea and I'm happy with that but in
its current today it's only just a good
device and not something I can recommend
based on that but also the very very
high price point thanks for listening
