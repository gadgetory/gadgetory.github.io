Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly this
is the last episode of the year and
really quick I want to thank everybody
for tuning in and watching every single
week now let's get right into those
headlines a little more news leaked out
about Nintendo's upcoming android game
this week it's been all but confirmed
that it's going to be a social media
style application and the clothing items
will be used to customize your avatar
we're not sure where the game part is
yet but we'll find out eventually last
week we reported that there were 35
awesome games on sale on Google Play
that list has been updated and there are
now over 85 titles available right now
with varying amounts of discounts some
of the games include most of Square Enix
is library half-life two worms two NBA
Jam most of chem ko's library and plenty
of others check it out before these
deals end in an effort to show people
that the Play Store is more than just
absent games google play as having a
promotion to get users into the other
parts of the store until january fourth
you can get three months of google play
music for just one dollar some google
play book titles are up to eighty
percent off and the movie rentals are up
to 75 percent off in perhaps one of the
best news stories of the year it was
announced that the Beatles are finally
coming to streaming services for the
first time in most markets as of now you
can listen to the Fab Four on Apple
music google play music microsoft group
rhapsody amazon prime music slacker
Spotify and title it's been rumored that
Google is creating another messaging
service and this one is a little bit
different instead of the usual paradigm
where you can chat and stuff like that
this new service is rumored to have a
ton of bots that will chat with you make
recommendations and fetch information
we'll have to see what happens if this
rumor turns out to be true for even more
Android apps and games headlines updates
and new releases don't forget to check
out this week's newsletter which is
linked in the video description below
where we'll have all of the information
from the last week if you want you can
head to the written companion which is
also linked in the video description
below and subscribe using the form found
there and we'll send this newsletter to
your inbox every single Sunday okay
let's take a look at the apps and games
that made a big splash this week as
usual if you want to check any of these
apps or games out you can find those
links in the video description below
once your ex is a
early new launcher that seems to blend a
simple premise with some complex ideas
it's built on the AOSP three launchers
so it's fairly close to stock in terms
of performance and look but the
developers have added plenty of extra
goodies they include a metric ton of
customization options gesture controls
swipeable docks a slide out drawer and
you can even recreate the Google now
launcher functionality it's new which
means the little rough around the edges
but it's worth a shot the space jet is
an online aviation shooter where you
must fly a spaceship and shoot down
other people who are also flying
spaceships the controls are surprisingly
good and the game is actually quite a
bit of fun to play as you play you
unlock upgrades for your spaceship that
can do a lot more damage give you powers
like camouflage and a whole lot more it
is a freemium game so there is a bit of
a pay to win mechanic and there are some
ads here and there but it's an
above-average multiplayer shooter Metro
2033 Wars is an open-world strategy game
based on the book of the same name you
play in a post-apocalyptic wasteland as
you do battle with rival factions you'll
also be tasked with strengthening and
improving your specific metro station
which adds a bit of simulation and city
building elements as well it's a tad
expensive but it is a pay once game with
no in-app purchases and it's a great
pick up if you like strategy games lego
nexo knights is the newest game from
lego that's meant to accompany the short
series of videos that follow the same
storyline this is a hack and slash style
of game where you must defeat the evil
jestro and save the kingdom this is
meant to be played with accompanying
action figures which can be scanned for
additional powers but it's playable
without them as well it's good for older
kids and it's also free with no in-app
purchases the gods of Rome is the latest
release out of gameloft and
interestingly enough this one is a
fighting game it's sort of a call back
to the fighting games of old and the
mechanics are similar to games such as
injustice and soul calibur there is
actually a story to this one and your
role is to fight to restore peace in
your era it's simple yes but fighting
games generally are it's a freemium game
so you can expect some pay to win
mechanics but overall it's not half bad
