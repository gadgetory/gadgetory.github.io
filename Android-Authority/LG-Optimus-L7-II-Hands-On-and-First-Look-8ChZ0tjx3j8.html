Congress here in Barcelona Spain and
we're like we're taking a look at some
mid-range phones here sort of cap off
this whole experience is Joshua pagar
from android authority what's going on
everybody and what we're looking at is
the series l 2 by LG this is the l7
variation now there are the l7 the l5 in
the l3 let me just make sure my specs
over here we're starting off with the l7
and then I'll show you the l5 and 3
afterwards but pretty much the specs on
the l7 or very mid-range and then they
kind of go downhill as you go down to
the 5 and a 3 which is expected that
being said however you're looking at a
4.3 inch IPS wvga display right here so
hardly high quality 720p not even of
course far from 1080p but the display
looks more than adequate for the casual
user performance seems pretty good
especially considering that there is a
Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 play chipset in
here now clocks on a 1 gigahertz it's a
dual-core processor and there's also
adreno 203 graphics powering or rather
backing up that's CPU
aside from that however we go down the
line with more of the mid-range specs it
is not one gigabyte of RAM it is instead
768 megabytes of RAM there is an eight
megapixel camera on the back however and
four gigs of onboard expandable storage
which is expandable via a micro SD slot
which i believe is accessible underneath
the cover 4.1 jelly bean is what you're
getting here in terms of the android the
android OS and a 24 60 ml amp hour
battery won't ensure that you have quite
a bit of power inside of this phone so
you can use it it is actually is
nonetheless far from the 5 inch displays
that we've been seeing at mwc this year
it is actually far from the 4.7 inch
screens that were used to but there is
always a market for smaller phones like
this and there are a lot of people out
there who don't necessarily need the
highest specs the greatest features
inside of their phones they just need
something that is easy and that works I
will tell you this though the build
quality on this does feel quite nice
with a matted back right here so that
this phone definitely has some life in
it it's pretty rugged so maybe a little
bit smaller would mean a little bit more
sturdy so LG has come out with the elves
series and we're going take a look at
the l5 in the l3 in just a sec</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
