brought to you by gamefly welcome back
to android weekly my name is Jason this
is where we cover the week's Android
news and we found out about a mystery
technology that's going into what is
looking to be a beast of a phone that is
the one plus one we also find out what
the head of samsung mobile said about a
rumored galaxy s5 premium edition rumor
real yes I'm sorry to tell you my
friends that the head of samsung mobile
has shattered the dream that many of us
had of a premium galaxy s5 according to
the Korean media mr. JK Shin has
officially denied the possibility of a
premium galaxy s5 saying that the rumors
reporting its existence are completely
false Shin instead mentioned that
Samsung would be releasing a new Galaxy
Note model this fall so does this
officially closed the door on a phone
with a metal clad chassis not
necessarily this samsung mobile head did
say there'd be no premium galaxy s5 but
that doesn't mean we won't see a phone
with a beautiful metal clad chassis in
the future we'll just have to wait and
see now moving on to what could be
potentially a beast of a phone the 1+1
is designed by former opel vp and
running a popular cyanogenmod rom this
smartphone could potentially shakes
things up in the android world last
week's announcement confirmed that the
phone will be running a snapdragon 800
running at 2.3 gigahertz the handset
will feature a massive 5.5 inch display
running at 1080p resolution it will also
include a 3100 milliamp hour battery
that is non-removable I know that will
disappoint many of you but you should
know what the CEO peter loud did say
about the battery and removable battery
would have meant adding a protective
layer to the motherboard as well as
extra circuitry resulting in a smaller
battery or a significantly thicker phone
there is also some mystery battery
technology that is meant to quote
enhance and boost the user experience
now we don't know exactly what this
mystery technology is but it could be
something similar to the Snapdragon
glance which monitors your app usage and
then optimizes for battery life the one
plus one is expected to go on sale in
the second quarter of this year
with a retail price of no more than four
hundred dollars moving on to some
important updates when it comes to the
Google Play Store this time around the
updates to the Google Play Store app
includes some design tweaks and the
ability to batch install which will make
those of you with a new phone very happy
now you don't have to install each
individual app you can simply batch
install but perhaps the most important
features that they've added in-app
purchases to the app permission list
allowing you to password protect those
purchases now you're free or to have
your life destroyed by your clash of
clans addiction but if those in-app
purchases are getting you down you may
want to consider other affordable
options to getting your gaming fix like
my current gaming fix battlefield yeah
they don't call me daddy headshot for
nothing you see when you become a
gamefly member you can rent this title
or any of the 8,000 classic and new
titles they have to choose from across
all consoles and handhelds rent up to
four games at a time and keep them as
long as you like gamefly members can
also play hundreds of PC games for free
with unlimited PC play and our own Joe
Hindy challenged me and it's clear he
needs that extra pc gaming time he needs
to unlearn his bunny hopping ways so
come join me Josh Joe and Kevin as we
play our favorite games and see if you
can beat our scores I know most of you
have quashed my flappy bird score
already the a droid army can get a one
month free trial when they go to
gamefly.com /a Bertie moving on to news
about a rumor regarding Google's new
SmartWatch last month we heard a rumor
claiming that LG and Google were teaming
up to release a SmartWatch with plans to
debut the device at Google i/o this June
now thanks to a tweet from EV links we
might know a little bit more about what
this SmartWatch could look like keep in
mind that Ed links does not have a
perfect rumor track record but it gets
us a little bit closer in the tweet we
learned that the watch will have a 1.65
inch LCD with a 280 x 280 resolution
other specs include a 512 megabytes of
ram and 4 gigabytes of storage no word
on the processor just yet thanks for
watching a droid army
my name is Jason loved it connect with
you here on Google+ or Twitter or in the
comments below tell me what you think
about the one plus one that looks like a
beast of a phone i'm really excited
about it I told you that Chinese
manufacturers would come and eat
everyone's lunch if Samsung and LG
weren't careful they're doing some good
things that's what China does tell me
what you think in the comments below
don't forget to connect with my brothers
nandroid Josh Joe and the tech ninja
Kevin I shall talk to you next week on
android week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
