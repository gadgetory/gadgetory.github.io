everybody and David Emmel and I were
able to go to the Qualcomm campus in
sunny San Diego for a couple of days
recently and Qualcomm brought us out
along with a number of other media
outlets to share with us their
announcements that happens right before
MWC which is where we are at right now
now Qualcomm had a couple of
announcements regarding 5g internet
their roadmap for creating the
infrastructure and also what they
believe that 5g could become for
consumers and we want to express our
excitement for it but I'm going to go
ahead and do that a little bit later
while I bring you a blog style video
just kind of showing you what we got up
to at the Qualcomm campus there's also
going to be a bit of a demo later on in
a couple of different settings regarding
the snapdragon 835 and the capabilities
that it has as well but first we arrived
in San Diego and we meet up with
Qualcomm themselves now our first day
was basically a long presentation that
was the first maybe four hours before
and after a bit lunch where we were just
being told exactly what 5g would mean
and how Qualcomm was going to leverage
what we have already while creating new
infrastructure and bands in order to
make 5g of reality now I understand that
a lot of this is very low level and by
that I mean they're going to hear a lot
of jargon there's going to be a lot of
terminology that might go over many
people's heads but for the general
consumer the reason why this ends up
being very exciting is because we're
going to see a speed increase unlike any
other in 5g coming from even 4G LTE
which we are using right now imagine for
a second that the speeds that you are
enjoying whether it be on Verizon or
t-mobile or whatever the case may be can
only really get to about 20% of what
all--come expects to be gigabit LTE now
that's only going to be one facet of 5g
and essentially the whole point about 5g
is not just the speed but also the
reliability there were a few demos that
they showed us that showed that the
Wi-Fi connection or even the mobile
internet connection that they were
putting out to a van that was
running around the entire campus was
able to switch between all of the
different nodes without any drop in
signal or speed and even then the signal
was much wider given their
implementation and that is something
that they hope 5g will be able to bring
to the masses
now 5g also has another very important
application and that's going to be for
things like IOT essentially you will use
a 5g network that has a very reliable
connection to be able to power all the
different things in your life whether it
be in your home or even just with your
car's a video showed us a demo that
showcased self-driving cars and while it
does probably use the same sensor arrays
and the same self learning that a number
of other cars and concepts currently do
what was important in this demo was
knowing that the cars were communicating
with each other
a 5g style connection would be emanating
from every vehicle and let's say there
was a car that would be stopped in the
middle of the road and your car is
autonomously driving towards it now in
order to avoid a collision the
information that's coming from the
stopped car would connect with your car
and then the car that you're in would be
able to avoid it accordingly the
autonomous driving example was also kind
of shown to us via drones now these
particular drones were given a platform
that allowed them to communicate with
one another and to signal to the rest of
the group that the path would be safe
which meant that they went around these
barrels and this obstacle course in a
rather slow manner but over time they
would start to speed up knowing that the
path was clear which brings us to the
Snapdragon 835 and we got a couple of
demos showcasing its abilities one put
into the right devices
now the 835 is going to be somewhat VR
centric in the sense that Qualcomm is
heading up a accelerator program in
which they allow companies who want to
get into the VR space a kind of template
a sort of guideline that will allow them
to create the wonderful VR experiences
that hasn't really been standardized yet
however one of the best parts about this
VR platform is the fact that it is able
to do spatial recognition thanks to the
processing power of the 8:35 putting
this chip inside of a phone that allowed
for spatial recognition via the cameras
on the
back aloud Qualcomm to create a VR
experience where we could actually walk
around and you don't need the different
sensors that you would expect from
things like the HTC vive we got to tell
you it was a pretty nice experience
being able to put on a mobile VR headset
and be able to duck or stand or sit or
be able to walk around a particular
scene much like on the HTC vive and that
is being powered by a phone and in order
to get all of the data that the
application and the phone itself would
be able to process via its sensors well
they had to find every single plot point
that a person might actually take inside
of the VR space which meant that a rig
like this a mannequin head that is
basically thrown around and put in
basically an infinite number of
positions would be able to get the data
points that they really needed in order
to create a good immersive and spacial
recognizing VR experience and with that
we concluded our two days at Qualcomm we
were able to learn a lot about 5g even
if a number of the things they talked
about went over some of our heads but we
understood why we should be excited
about the future of mobile Internet and
then the snapdragon made 35 which we're
going to see in a number of phones
coming in this year on beyond we were
excited to see that the 835 is capable
of so much and we got some actual use
cases from it we want to thank Qualcomm
for taking us out and for giving us
full-on demos and actually showing us
what their products are capable of and
we really think that Qualcomm has a lot
of say into the future of what could be
IOT 5g autonomous driving and of course
our mobile phones and beyond keep it
tuned to android authority for qualcomm
and even more in the world of android
