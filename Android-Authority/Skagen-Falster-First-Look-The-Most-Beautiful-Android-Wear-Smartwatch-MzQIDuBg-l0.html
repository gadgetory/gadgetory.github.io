everybody and we're taking a look at the
Scogin falster now Scogin already has a
great library of analog watches and a
growing library of hybrid smart watches
however this is their first touchscreen
device now this particular one runs
Android wear which means that it is
compatible with Android and iOS devices
making it a pretty accessible device
just like their other hybrid
smartwatches however you'll get access
to Google assistance all of the
different smartphone notifications via
cards that you might be used to an
Android wear already and of course
customizable watch faces which we'll get
into in a second but the first thing
that you'll notice about the falster is
its minimalist modern design Scogin
really did nail the design of the foster
we think and we believe that this is one
of the most beautiful Android wear
smartwatches we've seen thus far one of
the reasons why is because of the design
while being minimalistic is also at a
good size it's not too small for most
people who might have larger wrists
however for those like women who might
be looking for smaller bodies and
there's more watches this actually fits
the bill quite well there's even a dial
over on the side that has a nice meaty
and satisfying click to its meaning that
this is a sturdy yet sleek device all
around it does have interchangeable
watch straps which include this leather
option that we saw and also these mesh
straps that we saw as well underneath
the surface there is the Snapdragon wear
2100 processor that powers what is kind
of the smoothest Android wear iteration
we've seen thus far as well there's just
something about this clean interface but
also just how smooth the animations look
that make its feel just a bit more
premium than other Android wear
smartwatches that we've used there are
four watch faces already installed and
all of them showed just enough
information without cluttering up the
screen overall the falster offers an
edited take on useful functionality and
simpler cleaner interfaces Scoggin might
have created a SmartWatch that is
actually incredibly accessible for way
more audiences then you might expect for
usual Android wear smartwatches the
falster will come in at $275 and 295
dollars depending on your configuration
and will launch sometime in January 2018
so keep it tuned to Andrew authority for
more about the Scoggin falster and more
Scoggin smartwatches including the
hybrid SmartWatch like the yarn that we
did review a little while
and then keep it into Android 34 even
more from CES 2018 because we are of
course your source for all things
Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
