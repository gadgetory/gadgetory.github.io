domain.com so by now I imagine you've
seen this fantastic drop test from
Motorola but as geeks want to know
exactly how you did that
just last week Verizon took the wraps
off the brand new Motorola Droid turbo 2
and the Motorola Droid Maxx - while the
latter is covered in strong panel of
Gorilla 3 glass the former which is the
higher end of the to sports what
Motorola is calling its new shatter
shield technology what does that mean
the company walks us through just what
makes their turbo twos display Motorola
claims the turbo twos display consists
of an integrated system of five layers
that are designed to absorb shock and
never shadow supposedly three years in
the making
moto shatter shield consists of
specifically these five layers the first
is a rigid aluminum core that provides
structural integrity and durability on
top of that they've added an AMOLED
flexible display using a flexible
display absorb shock and makes it
possible to flex during a drop versus
breaking like most screens third is a
dual touch layer with redundancy that
was created to help survive accidents
the force layer is the interior lens
which provides a clear protective shield
that won't crack or shatter and lastly
is an exterior lens that Motorola claims
is a unique hard coat that helps protect
the display against normal wear and tear
and they're not kidding
check out CNN's torture tests not only
do they drop the phone numerous times on
concrete and gravel they also ran over
the phone screen up with a bicycle and a
horse's hoof the phone screen actually
dented before it's shattered or cracked
crazy having a phone with a shatterproof
screen may be great for some but how
great is the screen when you're not
dropping it the droid turbo 2 has a big
5.4 inch quad HD AMOLED display but
because there are so many layers between
the display and the glass the display
won't be able to shine as much light
through all of those layers now
according to ARS technica there is some
visible space between the clear front
panel and the display which results in a
device that isn't as bright or as clear
as some other smartphones with
higher-end displays it's a gray muddy
mess says ARS Rana Mario and that's a
good point I sure would have loved to
have this
on my phone before I smashed it but at
what point does that shatterproof
technology become too much of a
hindrance and it sort of looks like
you're looking through pop bottle lenses
it's a give and take maybe can't wait to
get my hands on one what do you guys
think how important would shatter proof
technology be to you on your phone so do
you guys will remember from like 15
years ago when people were making money
hands over fist in the dot-com bubble
remember we didn't call it a dotnet
bubble or dot org bubble we didn't call
them dot biz billionaires we called them
dot-com billionaires because that's the
power of a.com now why is that because
no domain name extension tells your
story with the same degree of trust as a
dot-com or dotnet domain name.com and
dotnet domain name extensions inject
credibility into your online presence
