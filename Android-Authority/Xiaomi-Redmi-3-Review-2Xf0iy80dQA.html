note 3 it was only a matter of time
before xiaomi unveiled the redmi 3 hey
what's up guys this is Bailey Stine with
Android authority and you're watching
our full review of the xiaomi redmi 3
the redmi 3 takes many of the same
design elements found on the redmi note
3 and fits them into a smaller 5 inch
form factor the redmi 3 is all-metal
curved unibody design not only offers a
premium look but with its smaller form
factor and pronounced curves feels great
in the hand this time around xiaomi has
added a sort of non textured pattern
finish on the rear of the redmi 3 which
looks to be a pretty good addition in
comparison to the milk threes design on
the top right you'll find both the power
and volume keys which offer excellent
tactile feedback xiaomi has also
included their now standard IR blaster
on the top of the device for controlling
televisions and other household
appliances which can be used with either
the pre-installed remote app which
offers limited non-chinese device
support or with the third-party apps
such as peel Smart Remote which arguably
works even better especially for those
outside of China although the redmi 3
sports a 5 megapixel front-facing camera
you unfortunately can't really rely on
it if you're counting on capturing
quality selfies
there's no capacitive key backlighting
at the bottom but there is a
multicolored notification LED which is
certainly nice to have with the downsize
from 5.5 inches on the note 3 to 5
inches on the 3 there also comes a
resolution drop from 1080p to 720p 720p
is definitely still respectable for both
the size and the price of the redmi 3
and perhaps most interestingly the redmi
3 seems to offer better contrast and
saturation than the note 3 on the other
hand there does appear to be a minor
amount of color shift when viewing the
display at certain angles
also while the adaptive brightness
feature worked very well during our
testing we found it difficult to view
the redmi 3 display in direct sunlight
which may be problematic for some users
under the hood we have an octa-core
qualcomm snapdragon 616 processor which
offers fairly good performance save for
some occasional hiccups like
unresponsiveness while typing and the
dreaded choppy animations there's also 2
gigabytes of RAM which should be enough
for most users looking for a phone in
this price category the redmi 3 is able
to play most games reasonably well
thanks to the adrenal 405 but bear in
mind that some high-end games will
exhibit frame drops and slow load times
however even some games like asphalt 8
run with very little lag so your
experience may vary the redmi 3 boast
802 11 and Wi-Fi GPS and Bluetooth 4.0
all of which work just as we had
expected it also has a number of
cellular bands onboard but you keep in
mind that if you are in the US you will
be limited to HSPA+ i'm ET in all areas
and HSPA+ on t-mobile in most areas it
is an unlocked dual SIM device however
with one of the SIM slots available for
expandable storage up to 128 gigabytes
speaking of storage you'll beginning 16
gigabytes of internal storage onboard
which should be enough for the majority
of users we were pleasantly surprised to
find that the redmi 3 is rear speaker is
actually fairly loud lv 8 while having a
moderate amount of distortion the
biggest drawback is arguably its rear
facing position which can make the audio
sound muffled when the phone is set on a
flat surface
we were most impressed with the redmi 3
s incredible battery life which we
consider to be unprecedented for this
form factor there is no doubt that the
4100 milliamp hour battery 720p display
and conservative processor up the phone
reach very high screen on times even
after 2 days of use virtually every user
will have no problem achieving a full
day of heavy use and then some while
light use could translate to 2 to 3 full
days without a charge the redmi 3 is 13
megapixel f 2.0 rear camera is able to
produce reasonably good looking images
despite a lack of dynamic range and
tendency to over sharpen HDR does help
quite a bit
but it also takes a few seconds and
often makes images look less realistic
the u.s. camera app offers a good amount
of manual control while still being
pretty easy to use you can adjust things
like white balance and ISO and manual
mode or use a variety of other modes
like panorama out of the box the xiaomi
redmi 3 runs xiaomi zni ui7 on top of
android 5.1.1 lollipop although some
have frowned upon its iOS like design we
generally enjoyed our time with me UI
and we're very happy with the overall
amount of polish that can be found
throughout the UI feels easy to use but
also offers a commendable amount of
customization and extra features which
will appeal to android enthusiasts not
only does it offer features like car
according and scheduled battery profile
changes but it also allows users to
change things like the notification LED
color and the size of the one handed
mode display
we should mention however that getting
Google Apps in the Chinese ROM is an
extra step and a global variants along
with a global ROM has yet to be released
also Xiaomi has decided to start locking
the boot loaders and many of their
devices to our dismay the complicated
process for unlocking the bootloader in
order to override potentially malicious
reseller roms with stock roms is
deplorable Xiaomi is requiring users to
apply for unlocking privileges and await
an acceptance or denial response which
Xiaomi says can take up to ten days to
receive to be clear we are in favor of
the more secure locked boot loaders but
we feel that shelby's process for
unlocking only invites malware to be
preloaded on devices leaving China as
users will now have a very tough time
removing it in addition we are not
expecting any Android OS updates for
this phone which may disappoint some
users however we should also note that
me UI does receive updates of its own
which are released relatively frequently
the xiaomi redmi 3 is now available in
silver gray or gold within China for
$6.99 rum and B or about $108 do keep in
mind however that resellers tend to
markup that price from anywhere from 140
to 160 dollars for that price it's very
difficult to complain about the redmi 3
after all it's one of the best phones
that we've used in this price category
and it's excellent design great software
and crazy good battery life greatly
overshadow its flaws while its mediocre
camera lack of u.s. 4G LTE support and
locked bootloader troubles may be
disappointing the redmi 3 provides a
level of value that we simply have not
come to expect at this price point with
that said unless you have an unusually
tight budget one a smaller form factor
or really need the extra battery life we
recommend its older brother the redmi
note 3 with its higher resolution
display faster processor still great
battery life and a fingerprint reader
for only $30 more in China and even less
through resellers thank you so much for
