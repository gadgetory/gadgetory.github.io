available in the US blue is sure to
stand out with a large collection of
devices blues most recent edition third
lineup is the life 8 XL a $130 unlock
smartphone with an upcoming upgrade to
Android 5.0 lollipop this is Bailey
Stein with Android authority and this is
my full review of the blue life 8 XL the
life 8 excels design is incredibly
similar to that of its older brother the
life 8 as you may have guessed the excel
tag indicates a slightly larger form
factor with a 5.5 inch display in
addition to the larger sides the 8 XL
also opts for on-screen buttons rather
than capacitive keys it is available in
five flashy colors and is one of the
thinner options available at 7.7
millimeters the 8 megapixel camera does
protrude from the back however which may
be something you dislike considering
that it does make the phone wobble a bit
when you set it on a flat surface the
matte plastic rear cover does feel nice
to the touch and I was happy to find
that blue retained its removability
despite having it wrap around the chin
of the device speaking of the chin it's
pretty large
especially when you consider that we're
dealing with on-screen buttons taking
off the back cover you can access dual
Micro SIM slots a micro SD card slot
which supports up to 64 gigabytes and
the 29 20 milliamp battery the full
metal band isn't all that convincing and
there are noticeable parting lines on
both the top left and top right corners
of the band the power and volume buttons
which are on the right side of the
device are fairly clicky
but they do rattle if you shake the
device there is an orange notification
LED at the top left of the phone however
it isn't really bright enough to see
unless you're in a poorly lit
environment there's also a 2 megapixel
front facing camera as mentioned just a
minute ago this phone does have a larger
form factor than the light 8 instead of
packing a 5-inch display the life 8 XL
features a 5.5 inch 720p display which
of course makes the device much larger
the screen itself isn't the worst
scene but it's certainly not the best
either well it does get plenty bright
sunlight readability is still poor and
viewing angles could be better the
resolution does make for a pretty low
pixel density of 267 PPI and it's
difficult to advocate that resolution
for display this large blue does include
a pre-installed screen protector as well
as a replacement in the box which may be
helpful considering that the device does
not have Gorilla Glass the life 8 XL
does include mediatek mt6752 1 gigabyte
of ram can be a problem when trying to
run more than a few apps at once for the
average user though the one that checks
Facebook can plays candy crush the life
8 XL is a great performer with the Mali
450 MP GPU the life 8 XL does handle
higher-end games quite well for the
price even with settings set to hide the
life in Excel did not drop frames as
easily as a few other budget devices
that I've tested in addition to support
for GPS 802 11 and Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
4.0 the 8 XL also supports GSM networks
it fully supports 18 T's HSPA+ network
while partially supporting t-mobile's
HSPA+ network I was impressed by the
rear speaker volume which was actually
loud enough to hear in a driving car it
is pretty 10t however and it is easily
blocked on a flat surface
the 8 megapixel rear camera took some
okay-looking images you really aren't
going to find anything much better in
this price range unfortunately so don't
expect to get any quality shots from
this phone I did notice that it had some
issues focusing on closer objects and
the overall quality just isn't very good
the user interface for the camera app is
pretty simple but you do still have
control over things like white balance
and ISO with a twenty nine twenty
milliamp removable battery low
resolution display and power sipping
processor the life 8xl provides
excellent battery life I was able to get
in just over four hours of screen on
time starting from about 7:00 a.m. and
ending at about 1:00 a.m. the next
morning it should get virtually all
users through a full day of use and some
may even be able to get it last into the
next day a bit out of the box the life
8xl runs stock Android 4.4.2 kitkat with
the exception of a few pre-installed
apps most of which can be uninstalled
the a texels ROM is completely stopped
that's pretty refreshing coming from
other devices blue has promised to
deliver an Android 5.0 lollipop update
in late July so hopefully we'll see that
soon blue is releasing the light in
Excel on June 22nd with 8 gigabytes of
internal storage for a hundred and
twenty nine dollars on Amazon to make
that deal a little sweeter blue is
offering $50 off for the first week
making the phone $79 this pricing is
only valid for the first week though so
be sure to act fast if you want to get
your hands on this device to conclude
the blue life in Excel is a good option
for those on a tight budget with flashy
color options stock Android 5.0 lollipop
and excellent battery life the blue
light in Excel is a good value for $79
however it does use an outdated
processor as a mediocre camera at best
and lacks 4G LTE support personally it's
hard for me to imagine someone choosing
this phone for 129 dollars when you can
buy slightly more expensive options like
the Moto G 2nd generation or Asus
zenfone 2 they are 50 to 70 dollars more
but if you consider the
some cellphone service ranging anywhere
from 30 to 80 dollars per month that
isn't so much of a reach so is it worth
it if it suits your need that $79 then
yes it's probably worth it at a hundred
and twenty nine dollars however I think
it would be better for most users to pay
a little more upfront to get a lot more
