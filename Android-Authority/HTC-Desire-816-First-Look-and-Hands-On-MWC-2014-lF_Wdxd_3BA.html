by bitdefender mobile security HTC's
large mid-range offering sports some
great specifications in a body that is
quite well designed hey it's Josh of
agar from Android authority what's going
on everybody and this is the HTC Desire
8 1/6 before we even get started I do
want to mention that we unfortunately
will not be showing you the screen
capabilities here because we were asked
not to show the operating system the
reason is because the next version of
Sense is in this phone and at the moment
it is being kept under wraps they
maintain however that we should
definitely be excited for the future of
HTC's interpretation of Android well we
can't tell you and we are still quite
excited for is the nice design language
in the desire 816 sporting a 5.5 inch
screen larger than most mid-range
offerings out there the 816 packs it
into a body that actually feels very
nice you'll already notice the boomsound
dual front-facing speakers that should
continue HTC's good sound tradition
despite a glossy plastic panel on the
back of the sides are of a non glossy
plastic that are very rounded and really
help with the feel whereas a rounded
back would feel quite comfortable in the
hand to these rounded sides seem to help
in a very similar way I personally
really enjoyed the handling experience
even if the larger screen does require
some hand gymnastics the screen is a
high quality 720p display that we can
tell you it's a very nice performer the
viewing angles are all quite great and
the brightness of the IPS platform
continues here underneath the surface is
the Snapdragon 400 processor clocked in
at 1.6 gigahertz with 1.5 gigabytes of
RAM 8 gigabytes of on-board storage
might seem a little small for a larger
device but a micro SD card slot does
help make up for that and finally a 2600
milliamp hour battery should power it
for quite a while
once again bugging the mid-range trend
HTC put in a 13 megapixel camera
something usually found in premium
offerings though trend-setting continues
with a front facing five megapixel
camera which is the highest megapixel
count for your selfie pleasure you'll be
able to take some good photos but also
some nice videos with the front facing
optics as they are also capable of 720p
video capture the desire 816 is
definitely an unconventional look at the
mid-range device but that is far from a
bad thing sporting some great
specifications in a body that impressed
we're excited to put the desire 816
through its paces when we get our hands
on one
once again this is Android authority
with HTC here at the Mobile World
Congress in Barcelona Spain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
