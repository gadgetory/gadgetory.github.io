name is Kevin the tech ninja and today
we are continuing our series on what's
on our devices with our watch faces
we're gonna talk about each watch face
and why we're using it
my favorite Android watch is the Moto
360 when it was unveiled in the summer
I've been drawn to the design of it I've
added the steel band to it about a month
ago and just adds that extra layer of
luxury to it so let's take a look at a
few of my favorite watch faces
the first one is station station reminds
me of one of my favorite movies try the
watch face sort of has a glow effect to
it and also love the smooth movement on
the second hand the watch has tons of
information at a glance like battery
date and time you can head into the
settings and make adjustments on what is
displayed in what's not displayed it's
not super customizable but it's just
enough to change it up a bit the second
watch face is an aftermarket one as well
this is Pucci black this watch face is
very customizable you can change pretty
much anything you want
this also has date battery information
and even the weather it's a clean layout
that you can tweak it to make it your
own
when we dig into settings you can see
everything you can change
honestly 10 watches in one there's tons
of combinations and it's just something
you should really take a look at the
last watch face is one that comes with
Android wear this one is called pass
Kuehl it's a simple watch face but the
colors pop very well it looks like an
old fashioned watch by the way it ticks
you can have large numbers at 12:36
if it wasn't for my flat tire and also
the 9 it's just a simple watch face that
I use to change things up a bit now it
is possible to change the colors just go
into the Android wear app and you can
change the background you could change
what color the hands are as well but
it's not as customizable as a watch face
like puji I actually think this is a
great topic to have right now and also
just recently the Android wear 5.0
lollipop update was released so a lot of
watch faces are available now but even
though there are a lot there and it
really adds to your customization I'd
like to take it a step further and use
an application that allows me
to pick my own image for the background
luckily for the Moto 360 which is the
Android wear watch that I currently use
I have the ability to do that built into
the Motorola 360 already and that is
using the Motorola Connect application
basically just head over there look at
all of the different watch faces which
actually look pretty good already the
built-in ones on the 360 are pretty
attractive already but the custom one
will allow you to pick an image for the
background and I guess you can pretty
much guess what I use for my background
but there is one thing I didn't want to
put out there if I raise my wrist up
right here you'll see that I have my
pebble back on my wrist with a brand new
leather cuff or rather leather strap the
reason why I went back to the pebble is
because thankfully because of the
openness of the Android wear platform
pebble has been able to add the
notification capabilities to their
notifications on the pebble ecosystem
which means when a notification comes in
you can actually have a number of
different ways of reacting to it either
by dismissing it or replying to it or
opening it on the phone which basically
brings the same type of functionality
you will get if you're swiping from the
notification cards on Android wear which
I thought was great and that allowed me
to have the same Android wear
capabilities yet on my pebble so with
that in mind I want to show you pebble
cards now this isn't necessarily a watch
face in terms of the general pebble
lexicon but it is an application that
allows you to have the time and the date
very simply displayed on the on the top
half and then on the bottom half you can
have a number of different cards now you
can have the weather or you can have
sports scores or you can have your
upcoming calendar event or if you're
like me you take advantage of the little
text box and you can pretty much guess
what I put it in there my life's motto
the next moment is only a moment away
all right so here is my moto 360 and
this is the Android wear watch that I
wear on a normal day-to-day basis if I
decide to wear one and this is actually
my own personal unit I did buy this one
for myself it's not a review unit or
anything like that
so that's why this is the one that I
decide to wear but my first favorite
Android wear watch base is actually one
of the default moto 360 watch faces and
it's called rotate and I really like
this watch faces because because it's
very simple very clean and just has a
very cool
to it and it has this little highlight
up top here that tells you exactly where
to look when you're just trying to check
the time and you can change the color of
this highlight to whatever color you
want through the moto Connect app so
that's really cool and the reason why
this watchface is called rotate is
because these little rings here the ring
for the hours and the ring for the
minutes actually rotate counterclockwise
as the time ticks by and if you just
kind of sit there and watch it you will
actually see them move which is really
cool so I really like the concept and I
Reluctant assign of this particular
watch base and this is the one that I
used the most out of all of the default
motorola watch faces on here so that's
why it is one of my favorites now these
next two watch spaces that I'm going to
talk about are from an app called watch
maker and the app itself is free on the
Google Play Store and some of the watch
faces within the app are also free but
some of them do cost a $0.99 for a pack
of six if you want to spend the
additional money for it but this first
one here is called glowworm and this one
is actually free and this is probably
one of the cooler free ones on there and
it's fairly simple basically just a
black background with green glowing text
and that's really all there is to it and
that's kind of why I like it I like the
fact that it has that little glow effect
kind of makes a screen pop a little bit
and it just looks really cool my third
and final favorite watch base is called
Clerkenwell and this is from a watch
pack called the round pack and this one
actually does cost a little bit of money
it's 99 cents for a pack of 6 like I
mentioned earlier and out of the 6 that
you get this happens to be my favorite
one and the reason why I like it is
because it's very simple very clean and
it tells you the time nice and big here
and also tells you the date up top here
as well but my favorite part about this
watch base is this little subtle
animation that you can see happening
along the the edge of the screen here so
as the seconds tick by this animation
just slowly fills up the entire
circumference of the screen so I really
like that little animation
and overall it's just a very clean
looking watch base and if you don't like
this black and white look you can change
it you can make it any color that you
want and you can also change the
background to a wallpaper if you want if
you don't want this solid color
background you can put any wallpaper of
your choice so it's very highly
customizable as are any other watch face
on the watch maker app but that's pretty
much gonna do it for me feel free to
check out these watch faces these are
the ones that I use the most so if you
have a mode of 360 or a G watch are
these watch faces right here are
definitely worth a look okay hey guys
this is a Joe Hindi and I'm going to
show you my Android wear smart watch
faces for my daily driver I use the LG G
watch it was just cheaper and I like
actually like the square design over the
circle design I know that's not a very
popular opinion but that that's what I
prefer for my watch face I use smart
watch faces buy us two us two are the
same guys who did a Monument Valley now
the design is really nice you know I
have a little bit of weather info there
there's the time and it just looks nice
you know it's not too ostentatious it's
easy to read and and all of that okay
here it is in the the Google Play Store
if you ever wanted to check it out this
is what you're looking for
there's actually four watch faces that
come with it but the only one I use is
that one the runway as it's called and
you know it doesn't have the highest
rating but it does look really nice and
you know that's the one I use most the
time okay so every now and again I also
like to use facer I don't use it all the
time because the watch face that I like
to use for face or has you know weather
and battery and all that stuff and every
now and again the weather unsink s-- and
that's so just that's just a little bit
annoying so i don't go with it all the
time but when i do i go with this
material design I can change the colors
you know if I want to because that's one
of the features of face where you can
change the colors and all that good
stuff the other one that I use every now
and again you know when I'm on video you
know I use the official Android
authority clock it's not official I'm
sorry I lied that's not an official one
but that somebody says something that a
fan made and I use it every now and
again when I'm on videos in case you see
the watch face on the video a little bit
of self-promotion
