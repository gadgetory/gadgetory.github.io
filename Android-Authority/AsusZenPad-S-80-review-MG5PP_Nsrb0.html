are still trying to find ways to
implement long-awaited features and
hardware changes into their phones it's
no easy task however this is a whole
different story when it comes to tablets
with their much bigger bodies it's a lot
easier to incorporate what should be
industry standard features this year a
soos is not playing catch-up loading
their newest tablet with the latest and
greatest features while still
maintaining a pretty affordable price
hello everybody I'm crystal and this is
the asus zento there's two things you
immediately notice when picking up the
zenpad S 8.0 first is well it's a little
tablet it's only an 8 inch screen and
this definitely helps it be a little
more portable and easy to bring along
somewhere but still it's not too small
word to fils the purpose of it being a
tablet and a lot of this is due to the
nice 43 aspect ratio of the screen so
now the second thing you'll notice is
wow this thing is really thin only six
point six millimeters in thickness so
this make surface comfortable 8 inch
screen really keeps this thing from
being too bulky and covers them but when
taking a look at the back of the Zen pad
we have some more nice design choices
that help this tablet from being on
wieldy we have a brushed metallic design
throughout the back bordered by a shiny
metallic edge that gives us tablet a
nice elegant look but towards the bottom
of the tablet when holding horizontally
we have a very soft to the touch
leathery material that feels really nice
when holding it gives your fingers a
nice place to rest when holding the
tablet horizontally and helps prevent
the tablet from easily slipping from
your hand the entire border of the
tablet is made of a soft rubbery
material that also helps the tablet feel
comfortable the camera can be found on
the back and at the top you'll find a
headphone jack the left side has a flap
to allow access to a micro SD card slot
that supports up to 128 gigs the right
side has the volume buttons and power
button and the volume buttons feel
pretty good they take a decent amount of
pressure to push but it keeps them from
being accidentally hit the power button
is very hard to press as the button
seems like it
even move it can be confusing to decide
if you actually push the button or not
without the tactile feedback but I do
think this was intended as well to
prevent accidentally turning off the
screen if this is an issue for you you
shouldn't worry because this end pad
supports the tap to wake feature on the
bottom of the tablet we have a USB
type-c charging connector which like I
was saying before it's very nice to see
a soos help push USB type-c closer to
becoming a norm on the same thought
clipping the tablet to its front we will
see two front-facing stereo speakers on
either side of the eight inch screen
it's no doubt the best place for
speakers to go especially on a tablet
where videos are regularly reviewed and
they sound awesome not just because the
sound is aimed right at you but the
speaker's themselves are designed quite
nicely
they are very crisp and clear inside the
Zen pad s 8.0 we have an Intel Atom
quad-core processor but for power VR GPU
this is also the world's first tablet
with four gigs of RAM although a two gig
model is available - in this review I'm
using the four gig of ram version it
comes in three storage options of 16 32
and 64 gigs and it's available in black
and white this Zen pad is not able to
connect to a cellular service so Wi-Fi
is your only option here the Zen pad s
8.0 has a beautiful 8 inch 2k IPS
display at a resolution of 1536 by 2048
viewing angles are fantastic colours
look very nice and by default are very
accurate if you want more saturation or
even more true to life colors you can
easily adjust them by using the
preinstalled asus app splendid you can
choose between balanced blue light
filter vivid and even make your own
customized setting text is very clear
and sharp there does appear to be a very
small amount of sharpening going on
throughout the display which can make
text appear a bit fuzzy but this is only
really noticeable in certain scenarios
like when black text is on a colored
background but this could always be
fixed on the road with a software update
the Zen pad s AIT's beautiful screen
makes viewing pictures of joy and you
would think this would be the same case
of videos too but for me I was a little
disappointed
this kind of subjective but when
watching videos the software tries to
smoothen the video so if a movie you're
watching is attended to be shot at a
cinematic 24 frames per second the
tablet will try to smoothen the video to
make it look like it was shot at 60
frames per second making it seem very I
don't know just very strange but like I
said this is all subjective so you might
actually love this feature but if you're
like me and don't there's a setting
called blur motion free well you can
either set this to high medium low or
totally disable it
the problem is even when I click disable
the effect is still clearly there I'm
not sure what's happening here but once
again this could easily be fixed in an
upcoming software update what it comes
down to is the screen itself is gorgeous
there are just some questionable
software implications that damper it but
thankfully those can always be changed
the Zen pad s 8.0 is running Android
lollipop with a CC skin called Zen UI
and I gotta say this is probably one of
the best stock you eyes I've used it
does kind of have its own take of
material design to it but I think it
looks pretty good in some areas like the
notification jar but in other areas like
navigation buttons it can look a little
bit dated a Seuss's Zen UI is preloaded
with a ton of uninstall apps which isn't
so great but the UI does come with a lot
of cool features which is great Zen UI
is close to a third-party custom
launcher you would download on Google
Play which is nice to see by holding
down or swiping up on your home screen
you get this cool little animation that
brings up a bunch of customizable
options it's similar to something you'd
find in popular launchers like nova
launcher like icon packs scroll effects
and launcher fonts it doesn't just stop
there though with touch gesture you can
draw letters while the screen is off to
launch certain apps in motion gesture
you can do things like shaking the
tablet to take a screenshot there's even
a kid mode where you can turn your
tablet into a protected environment for
a youngster set with parent controls and
a timer there really isn't enough time
to talk about all the features a Zen pad
s 8.0 has to offer but it's just really
cool to see a stock you I being so
customisable I know I had a lot of fun
playing around with this tablet and
making it the way that I wanted before I
even hit the Play Store
it's a little disappointing that
something like dual window or having
small versions of apps running
side-by-side is not available but that
might not be a big deal for some people
on the lockscreen you can set up to
three shortcuts to launch your most use
apps which is very handy by default
these are a camera mail and browser but
you can change them to whatever apps
you'd like or just disable them all not
only is the software of the Zen pad
great for customizing but it creates a
very smooth and lag free experience
animations are incredibly smooth
switching from app to app is quite fast
and there are really no complaints here
you can expect a stutter and lag free
environment on this tablet when you move
on to games you may notice a few
stutters or hiccups and these will
happen too often so it isn't something
to worry much about but like I said
before since this tablet has a smoothing
mode on it that you can't seem to take
off it can be a mystery if games are
actually dropping frames or not gaming
is also the only time you'll experience
a tablet getting warm it never gets hot
though overall this tablet handles games
very well so when it comes to the camera
does the Zen pad S 8.0 break the
tradition of tablets coming with meteor
cameras well maybe just a little it
definitely helps get closer the
front-facing 8 megapixel camera is
capable of taking good pictures but only
in very specific situations it does tend
to overexpose a lot like here no matter
how many shots I tried to take focusing
on different areas of the picture the
tablet just refused to expose correctly
other times it takes some pretty
gorgeous photos you never know what
you're gonna get but more often than not
you end up with a good picture details
can be pretty lacking and sometimes I
have some trouble processing some bright
colors but it is a horrible well no we
always say good cameras and tablets are
not a necessity as they are in
smartphones but it's always nice to have
a decent camera for a quick snap of
something and I think this tablet does a
great job of that it's definitely one of
the better cameras around in the tablet
there's no optical image stabilization
or anything like that on here
not even a flash but on the software
side of this thing is loaded with camera
facts for example pictures in low light
can be very dark and noisy there's a low
light mode which bumps up the brightness
and tones
the noise it's not very clear but this
feature does a great job at taking a bad
photo and turning it into an all right
one the front-facing camera is 5
megapixels but with enough light this
thing can take some pretty good detailed
shots for a front-facing camera in
normal lighting conditions selfie shots
can start to get grainy but when you're
shooting with the front-facing camera
you get even more crazy camera effects
which can always be fun on a tablet and
at the end of the day this tablet is a
big step in the right direction when it
comes to cameras and tablets it has his
faults but I was pleasantly surprised
this Zen pad s 8.0 has a four thousand
milliamp battery so it's a bit smaller
than most high-end tablets out there but
then again this is a little smaller and
thinner than most - and that 4000
milliamp battery makes with this tablet
software makes for some pretty decent
battery life I could easily get 5 to 6
hours of screen on time by spending my
whole day watching YouTube videos and
bouncing the Internet if you know
somebody who's going to be watching
videos all day long then this tablet
should easily last you all day overall
the Zen pad s 8.0 is everything a tablet
in 2015 should be with dual front-facing
stereo speakers 4 gigs of RAM 2k display
extremely customizable UI and it's USB
type-c connector Asus really did an
amazing job here the tablet has the
latest and greatest features we should
come to expect in this day and age right
out of the box this tablet exceeds
expectations and doesn't need any help
from third-party apps to create a great
tablet experience even for the bigger
tech enthusiasts thankfully the only
flaws in the Zen pad s 8.0 are software
related so they can easily be fixed on
time down the road for $299 the Zen pad
s 8.0 of course is well worth picking up
