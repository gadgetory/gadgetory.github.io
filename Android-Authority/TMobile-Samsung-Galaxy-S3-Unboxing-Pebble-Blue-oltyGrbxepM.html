lovers this is Clayton coming at you
once again from Android authority calm
today we've got an unboxing video of the
Samsung Galaxy s3 in pebble blue now
this is the t-mobile version of the
samsung galaxy s3 and mind you this is
just gonna be an unboxing video gonna
have our full review up on the YouTube
and the site here short this is just
gonna be an unboxing to give you an idea
of what this looks like coming straight
out of the box if you guys have one
ordered so anyways this is our 16
gigabyte blue the Sam T 999 galaxy s3
and we've got our nice a slide out cover
here it's got some of our specs on the
back as you can see says we have a 4G
capable device of course we have our 4.8
HD Super AMOLED display we've got our
1.5 gigahertz dual-core Snapdragon s4
processor now this is different from the
international version which has our quad
core a 9 processor I do have our
international version on hand to show
you some differences between the two
once we get it on a box but anyways
we've got our 8 megapixel rear facing
camera the AllShare Play it's NFC
enabled of course we've got our full HD
1080p video recording we have our 1.9
megapixel front-facing camera but enough
about the specs let's just get into
ripping this bad boy open see here we've
got our little plastic let's tear that
off yeah we got to tear it off up here
as well now on there it says important
and I can't really read what it says so
we're not gonna take that into account
these will just lift the top off have a
beautiful pebble blue samsung galaxy s3
right here in the Box got some
instructions on the screen here just
pull it out gives us a rundown on the
device we've got our LED indicator our
volume our power important please use
the new micro SIM in this box your old
sim will not be compatible anyways our
home button - it's very nice a home
button has some nice chrome accents on
there on the back we have our
instructions how to open and close the
box the back of the pebble blue device
this looks really really nice it's shiny
almost looks like some Chrome
peel this off as well it's great we've
got our LED or camera our speaker now
the back of the pebble blue might take
two fingerprints a little bit more than
we have on our white version of the
Samsung Galaxy s3 anyways we can peel
the back off show you what's back there
this is the back here we've got our
t-mobile SIM card in there our expansion
slot got our battery capable of NFC got
our back now this phone actually came
with Samsung's tech tiles which is a
very cool innovation this is their NFC
tags we'll have a demo of that once we
actually get the review video up for
this phone we'll just continue on with
the unboxing got on top at the phone was
resting in and we can pull out our
little compartment here to reveal some
cool information about the phone we've
got our information packet here like
there's two of them
merchandise return label Hansen
recycling program or terms and
conditions this phone also comes with a
charger some earbud powerup our device
for the first time screen feels great
the pebble blue looks really cool it's a
lot more reflective than I thought it
would be especially this part right up
here with a cool Android 4G boot up
animation for t-mobile of course our LED
notification light capacitive buttons
are light enough for the first time now
like I said guys we're gonna have a full
review of this phone but just for the
heck of it let's get into some of the
apps that come pre-installed now I don't
have much done to our international
version of the Samsung Galaxy s3 so I'll
just hold them side by side do have our
different wallpaper but the widgets that
come pre-loaded on the phone are
basically the exact same same layout
I've got some bonus a t-mobile apps of
course we've got some bloatware that's
gonna be coming on this phone that's
inevitable open up our app tray got our
instructions we'll go through yes we
have our t-mobile bloatware
there's not too much additional blow
where especially compared to what comes
on the International Version the
unbranded version they both have the
infinite scrolling but anyways guys
we'll get into the in-depth features of
this phone more in our complete review
but that was the unboxing of our
t-mobile galaxy s3 in the pebble blue
color we guys like it and stay tuned
with Android authorities</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
