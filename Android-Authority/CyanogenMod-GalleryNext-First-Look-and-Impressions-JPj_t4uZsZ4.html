Hindy the android authority app guy
cyanogenmod has been developing a brand
new gallery app called gallery next that
will soon be replacing the AOSP gallery
in cyanogenmod if you want to see what
it's all about you're in the right place
because we are going to check it out
okay since this app is still in beta
we're going to go over the functionality
and design pretty quickly so you can
have an idea of what this is all about
as you can see this is a gallery app so
it does gallery app like things like
viewing photos and videos stored on your
device as advertised you can sign into a
few services to get your cloud storage
photos as well this includes Facebook
Picasa Flickr and Dropbox signing in is
easy enough and everything loads as
quickly as you could reasonably expect
it to once everything is loaded in it
can be sorted a few different ways you
can view everything all at once in a
tiled layout view by album and view by
moments moments is simply a bunch of
photos that are grouped together by
common things like date of course there
are the basic functions of a gallery app
that are present as well there is a
sharing function the ability to view
photo details and support for photos
videos and gifs in terms of design
signage in mod keeps it simple there's a
left-side slide-out menu that lets you
navigate around the app and everything
is viewed in tile formats it's color
neutral so you don't have to worry about
it clashing with any custom themes
that's really it folks they kept it nice
and simple so here's a quick list of
things we liked about it it's very
simple there's no complicated menus to
deal with or weird unfamiliar user
interface elements you just open it up
pick a category you want to view and
then view content the moments feature
works on all of your photos at once for
each source individually which I thought
was kind of cool so you can have it work
for all of your photos or just your
Facebook photos or just your Dropbox
photos lastly signing into the various
cloud services is pretty easy usually we
do a list of things that we didn't like
but since this is a beta and some
features may not be fully implemented
and all the bugs may not be fully
squashed yet we're not going to give the
app the same scrutiny we would give a
fully released app that said there are
some small bugs that still need to be
squashed again it is a beta so this is
expected but I did experience a crash or
two while I was checking about
the only other thing is the number of
cloud services available right now it's
just the major for which is facebook
dropbox picasa and flickr while that'll
be just fine for most people support for
additional services would be nice to see
also there are no settings so you can't
really change anything about the app
even if you want it to overall this is
going to be a very solid gallery up
offering when it's finished it's simple
and modern with enough functionality to
put it head and shoulders above the
standard AOSP gallery app in most cases
it's quick and rusher bug fixes and
optimizations will make it even better
before it's released if you want to
check it out we have a link to the
Google+ community you can join to get
the app that also has the full
instructions it's fairly easy just join
the community become a beta tester and
then download it keep in mind this is
not a finished product yet so bad things
will probably happen while you use this
application until all the bugs get fixed
unless you're into being a beta tester
we recommend you pass this one up until
it becomes a full release once again I'm
