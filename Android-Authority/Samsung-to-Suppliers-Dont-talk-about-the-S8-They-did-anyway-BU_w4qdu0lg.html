Android Authority logo on my sweater
don't do it I know pretty stupid me
telling you not to do it actually made
you do it
but that's exactly what Sammy did when
they told their employees and suppliers
explicitly do not say a single word
about the Galaxy s8 of course someone
did and we found out what it was
Samsung has warned employees not to
discuss business operations especially
those related to the Galaxy S 8
according to a report from the Korea
Herald in an all internal email sent to
employees Samsung spoke of quote
irreversible ramifications and quote
great financial risk if such comments
were to be made public setting an
anonymous source the Korea Herald also
said that Samsung has told its suppliers
not to mention a single word of the
galaxy s 8 of course someone did a
Samsung supplier is claiming that
Samsung is planning to implement a dual
lens camera and an iris scanner on the
samsung galaxy s 8 which is expected to
be unveiled in February 2017 and for
those of you keeping score you remember
that last week we talked about a rumour
that stated that Samsung may be removing
the iconic home button altogether
sources told ichi news that samsung
wants to ditch the iconic home button
it's not clear what the alternative
solution would be the home button
incorporates the fingerprint sensor so
samsung will need to come up with a way
to embed the sensor in or under the
screen glass or otherwise come up with
some other solution now if this is real
this is a curious approach because now
more than ever
samsung needs leaks and rumors regarding
the s8 you see there are PR teams and
communication teams out there hired by
companies like Samsung whose job it is
to manage the press people like me they
want to give us certain leaks and rumors
certain images over certain periods of
time to lengthen out the press coverage
that their product gets it's free
publicity and it's fantastic this is how
this whole new digital media thing works
so if they want no leaks and rumors
whatsoever I called a little bit of
nonsense you'll remember when Tim Cook
of Apple said that
they were gonna double down on secrecy
and then we just got like triple the
amount of leaks and rumors regarding the
iPhone that was back on the iPhone 6
original so I don't know what do you
think let me know in the comments below
I suspect that we're gonna see lots of
leaks and rumors in the months to come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
