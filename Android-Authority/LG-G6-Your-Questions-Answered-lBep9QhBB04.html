authority and our LG g6 review is
already live and if you haven't seen it
yet that will be linked down below in
the description or up here in a card or
towards the end of this video but we
know that sometimes your question may
not always be answered in a review so we
took it to social media to see what
questions you guys still had about the
LG G 6 so let's go ahead and get started
this is your questions answered on the
LG g6 first question comes from Jay funk
on Twitter why doesn't the US have quad
jack and wireless charging and one g6
model well there actually isn't even a
version of the g6 that comes with both
the quad X and wireless charging if
you're if you're in Asian markets like
Korea you'll get the quad AK and you'll
also get 6 4 gigabytes of storage as an
option if you're in the u.s. you get
wireless charging and that's exclusive
to the US model only and if you're in
European markets you don't get either
one of those features and LG's reasoning
for this was that they sort of pick and
choose features that they feel are
important or in big demand in certain
regions so apparently people in the u.s.
really want wireless charging people in
Korea would rather have a quad DAC and
apparently Europeans don't want either
one I don't buy it but that's the
reasoning question number two also comes
from Twitter SF s Flo s thought some UI
design and how it compares to other
skins like stock Android or grace UX
well for me personally stock Android
will always be my number one choice if I
had to pick between stock Android or
skins
I prefer stock Android just because it's
Android the way Google intended it to be
and it's just a clean experience but I
will say that the GUI on the g6 is
actually really clean LG has done a
really good job with improving it the
colors are much more muted now they're
not quite as in-your-face the icons are
all the same size and the same shape and
the new apps have been revamped to this
two by one aspect ratio look and it
actually Falls more in line with
Google's material design so I really
like it a lot as far as how it compares
to Samsung's grace UX I think it's just
a step
find it but it's not too far off it's
still a really good experience so I
think LG has done a fantastic job with a
GUI Michael B editor on Instagram asked
do you think the 18 9 aspect ratio will
be much of an issue because of the black
bars to the side and because majority of
our content is 16:9 or 21:9 similar to
how the average user would have a
problem with an ultra-wide monitor
because of the content they consume
so if 18 by 9 does become the new
standard in smartphone screens which I
think it will there will be some obvious
growing pains right now most apps
actually scale perfectly fine to the new
aspect ratio but there are some apps out
there most of the games that won't scale
properly and in those situations you
will have the black bars and obviously
with 16 by 9 video as well but once the
content catches up to it and once app
developers get a chance to update their
applications for the new aspect ratio I
think it will be perfectly fine and we
won't have the issues with the black
bars anymore the next question is also
from Instagram actually the next few
questions will be from Instagram
Kadir Mohammed asks why do LG flagships
always have crappy battery life I'm
actually averaging like 5 hours of
screen on time on the g6 pretty
consistently so the battery life on this
is actually pretty good so I hope that
answers your question a 6 IM asked I'd
like a detailed camera review how does
the 5-megapixel selfie cam compared to
other flagships is there too much of
that beauty effect when taking a selfie
how do both front and back cameras
perform in low-light well to be honest
the front-facing camera isn't really
that great if I had to pick a weak point
of the g6 it would definitely be the
front-facing camera it's only 5
megapixels which LG has been using for
the last 3 years or so now and it's not
just because of the resolution it's also
because the detail really really isn't
there especially in low-light it really
falls apart in low-light you get some
really soft looking images and they're
just really grainy as well so it's not
see the best front-facing camera and as
far as the rear cameras go stick with
the standard angle because you get the
wider aperture and the optical image
stabilization that helps in low-light
and the images come out with better
color and better
sharpness whereas the wide-angle there
are a lot more washed out and you also
get a lot more blown out highlights as
well so if you shoot in low-light
definitely sick what the primary lens
unless you really have to have that
wide-angle next question comes from
Roberto is it a big loss that the
modularity system was removed absolutely
not the modularity was more or less a
flop on the g5 so unless you are one of
the two people out there that really
enjoyed the modularity everything about
the g6
from the glass and metal design the dust
and water resistance the wireless
charging all those moves were made for
the better and the g6 definitely gets
LG back into the smartphone competition
whereas the g5 was really pretty much a
forgettable smartphone at least anything
good about it was forgettable last
question comes from Shan spiring would
you recommend this for someone with very
small hands and yes I totally would
because even though it has a 5.7 inch
screen the 18 by 9 aspect ratio combined
with the really small bezels actually
makes this a really compact phone it's
even smaller than Google's pixel XL and
the iPhone 7 plus which have smaller 5.5
inch screens and it's even smaller than
the LG v 20 and the HTC u ultra which
have 5.7 inch screens so this is a very
compact phone I think anybody with small
hands or wants a phone with better
one-handed usability this is going to be
a really good choice all right there you
go guys that's going to wrap it up for
this little LG g6 Q&amp;amp;A session hopefully
you guys enjoyed it and hopefully I was
able to answer some of your questions
