Hindy the android authority app guy in
this is android authority QA where you
ask and we answer we have a lot of great
questions today so let's get started
Duma dang from Seattle Washington asks I
was wondering if you need any type of
antivirus protection for phones nowadays
i have a samsung galaxy s4 and i
download movies and games once in a
while so i worry about getting hacked or
getting a virus it really depends on
your browsing habits if you download
from trusted sources and stay away from
public Wi-Fi then you probably don't
need an antivirus app however if you do
download from untrustworthy sources and
you do connect to a lot of public Wi-Fi
you should probably pick one up just to
be safe in most cases you really don't
have too high of a risk but if you are
in a high risk situation it doesn't hurt
to have one ozzy asks is it recommended
to buy a nexus 4 16 gigabyte now or wait
for the nexus 5 well depending on where
you live the Nexus 4 may not be
available anymore anyway it's been sold
out of the google play store and rumor
has it that it's not coming back to make
way for the Nexus 5 the Nexus 5 should
be a vast improvement over the Nexus 4
so our advice is to hold out for a
couple of months to see what Google has
coming around the corner if by some
chance you're disappointed with the
Nexus 5 you can always pick up a used
nexus 4 on ebay amazon or sites like
suavo daniel all day asks given that the
HTC one max was not announced at IFA
2013 when do you think the phablet will
be announced and will be coming to
t-mobile currently we have no concrete
evidence as to when the HTC One max will
be announced or released thanks to the
plethora of rumors and the upcoming
holiday season we imagine that it won't
be too much longer evleaks tweeted that
the HTC One max would be going to sprint
but because the HTC One is on all the
carriers we would be genuinely surprised
to hear that it wasn't on all the
carriers as well justin asks hey guys i
am interested in learning if the LG g2
is going to have a locked bootloader
and/or encrypted bootloader
unfortunately the answer to that
question is yes so far three out of the
four major US carriers have released the
LG g2 and on all three devices the
bootloader has been locked rumor has it
that when t-mobile releases there's
later this month it will be locked as
well the brilliant minds at XDA are
mulling over how to fix this problem
right now and so far they do have root
however that's about as far as you can
get with
device right now Matthew asks I want to
know if brooding an Android device helps
battery last longer or is it the
opposite actually the answer is neither
rooting your device doesn't actually
change the battery use or the
performance of your device what it does
do is give you administrative access to
the root directory of your device which
gives you more control over your phone
you can then use that control to install
applications and modifications that
change your battery life and performance
but routing by itself won't do it once
again I'm Joe Hindy don't forget this
shows fueled by your questions if you
don't ask we can answer if you want to
ask a question the link for that is in
the video description also in the video
description are the social media links
and the link to the written companion to
this video thank you for watching and
have a wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
