in our full review and it's also
something we've heard from a lot of
users the question of if I have the
Galaxy s8 should I upgrade to the Galaxy
S 9 well
it's Joshua Vergara what's going on
everybody and we're here to explore that
a little bit we don't really have a full
vs. between these two but we did get
some camera samples and that for the
most part or rather in a nutshell is the
main difference between the galaxy s 9
and this the samsung galaxy s 8 for the
most part there's one little anecdote
that I can give that basically sums up
most of this comparison at times when I
had the galaxy s 8 and the galaxy s 9
just sort of sitting together especially
when they were face up I kind of mistook
one for the other now as a review or a
second glance is pretty much all that's
needed for me to figure out which one is
the SI and which one is the s9 obviously
with the smaller s eights the main thing
you're going to look for is the
fingerprint reader and its placement
it's a lot better on the s9 this time
around so it's a lot easier to reach as
compared to having to reach up pretty
high on the s8 and the SI plus speaking
of which the s8 plus in the s9 plus
that's even easier to figure out because
the s9 plus has a secondary lens which
pushes the finger / reader even further
down on the body so it's easier to reach
that sensor on that larger body so I
went ahead and used the galaxy s 8 for a
few days because I sent my s 9 plus over
to another team member for further
testing what I wanted to do was see if
the day-to-day experience was actually
any different between these two now
obviously I'm going from the plus model
down to the regular model but that just
kind of reinforces what I said in my
full review I would prefer this smaller
addition mainly because it's just easier
in the hand but aside from the placement
of the fingerprint reader there's really
not a whole lot separating these two
lines all of the buttons are in the same
places including the big sweet button
over on the side and you still have that
haptic feedback home button on the front
just below the screen so if you press
hard on the bottom portion of the screen
then you have effectively a home button
and the infinity display is basically
the same they didn't really put any
changes into it at all and the
specifications still bring quad HD to a
Super AMOLED screen that looks pretty
great now performance is something that
you might want to upgrade to when it
comes to the galaxy s 9 because it has
the Snapdragon 805 and also the galaxy s
9 plus has 6 gigabytes of RAM so you
might want that little
Bob for multitasking and just overall
performance boosts but the Galaxy s8 has
the snapdragon 835 and has been working
perfectly fine I've been able to play
plenty of games on this especially with
Bluetooth controllers as I've been
trying out lately and I've been able to
get pretty much everything done during
the day and the experience hasn't
changed a whole lot if anything certain
features might be different like for
example Android Oreo is now onto Galaxy
S nine but that should be coming to the
sa pretty soon but even then things like
the picture in picture that foreo
provides the s9 are already covered by
different multitasking tools like the
pop-up view that is in the sa and in
TouchWiz already so that means that the
only real holes are in big speed after
all Bixby got a couple of updates mainly
in the AR side of things
it got augmented reality versions of
live translation and even food
recognition which are kind of cool it's
debatable whether or not it would be
useful for most people but if it is for
you then obviously the s9 has that trump
card granted Bigsby does get updated
fairly regularly in Samsung's camps so
it may not be that long until you start
to see these features come on the
previous models so obviously it's all
about this camera and on the Galaxy S a
to add F 1.7 aperture lens that still
did a really good job in low-light but
it got even better in the galaxy s 9
with F 1.5 aperture and that's not even
putting in all of the hardware
enhancements adding actual blades into
the camera that stopped the aperture
down to F 2.4 aperture it's just a feat
of engineering but the S 9 does try to
really enhance its photos not only with
this dual aperture but also with multi
frame processing Ram is actually built
into the camera module it takes a ton of
photos and uses all of that data to
create the best final results now this
isn't fully confirmed but one thing I
did notice during my review of the s 9
plus was that the multi frame processing
seemed to only work on the main lens
even on the zoom lens it didn't really
seem to be doing its magic and it simply
wasn't working in the front-facing
camera so that DRAM that they built into
the camera module is only really in one
place which kind of makes sense because
they have to build at those camera
modules for also the smaller s9 so of
course it would be in the main lens and
probably nowhere else one of the obvious
omissions in the SI compared to the s9
or all of the new mode
that were added in if you look over to
the modes at the SA there really isn't a
whole lot to get excited about there
compared to the newest model you have
super slow-mo in the Galaxy S nine and
also a are emoji if that's something you
really want to use but of course the
main thing we want to look at when it
comes to these cameras is the camera
quality and whether or not the s8 really
falls short compared to the s9 so we
took a bunch of photos with the s8 when
we did that huge camera comparison and
you can see a bunch of those videos and
the full camera comparison here at
Android authorities YouTube channel and
over on the website check the card so
you can see the large camera comparison
that Edgar and I did so we focused more
on low-light shooting and this was our
main metric for comparing the two phones
in night conditions with just the lights
on this bridge to show us the way the s8
was still able to bring out a pretty
good shot and it was comparable to that
of the s9 Samsung does tend to work its
cameras a little bit harder trying to
get a more exposed photo which is a
little bit of a trade-off because it's
at the slight expense of an accurate
recreation of the scene but it's kind of
hard to deny that Samsung is quite
impressive in these really dark
situations one last thing we'll talk
about in terms of the s9 plus is a
feature it has that might sway things in
its favor
the portrait mode because there are two
lenses on the back the phone is using
both of them in tandem to get the best
possible type of portraits with good
bokeh effects behind the foreground
subjects now arguably it is better
because it's using both of those lenses
and not relying on software but in our
testing we found that the cutouts are
mostly the same among all of the devices
with the s9 plus just being a bit more
consistent and so there you have it
after using this Galaxy s8 for the last
few days I found that if I just owned
this phone and it wasn't broken or
anything like that I'm probably in good
shape at least until the next note comes
out or you might even be able to extend
it until the next Galaxy S device comes
out aside from higher specifications
particularly in the s9 plus all of the
enhancements in the smaller s9 don't
completely change the day to day
experience so maybe a Galaxy Note 9 is
in your future or maybe the s10 or
whatever they're going to call it in
about a year but until that time no
matter what amount of time you choose
well the s8 should still have you
covered keep it tuned to andrew
authority for more about the galaxy s 9
maybe a little bit about the Galaxy S a
and you can see the
