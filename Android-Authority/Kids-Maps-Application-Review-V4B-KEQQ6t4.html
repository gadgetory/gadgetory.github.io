authority for another one of our
application reviews this one is for the
kids Maps application for honeycomb
tablets it's brought to you by the
developer medium mechanic and it's a
kids learning application that teaches
them about the states of the United
States of America let's take a look
hi let's learn about the states of
america because the green start button
to begin direct estate puzzle piece onto
its matching shape on the map nevada
nevada produces more gold than any other
state so as you see it brings a state up
on the right side gives a little fact
about it and then the kid uses them the
layout of the states on the left and you
can just drag it over you're awesome if
you want to start over just click the
orange reset button nebraska there are
many cows in nebraska so you can see
that it kept popping up with different
tips like earlier it said to click on
the green start button to to start out
the session and it also says you can
reset by hitting the reset button up
above there are a few different settings
that are available here you're able to
switch over to alphabetical on the
states or randomized or skip to the next
state alphabetical Alabama Alabama
starts with an A Alabama's state flower
is the camellia or you can switch back
to the randomized Wyoming Wyoming is
where you can see a rodeo and then you
can skip Arizona you can find cactus in
the Arizona desert so that's pretty much
all the functionality of that portion
but then you're able to change a couple
settings over here and generally the
only two options that are changeable is
the tips of which are the the start
button and the and the reset button
options where it tells you that you can
do those the other one is auto snaps so
that way for a real little kid really
what they need to do is just drag it
generally to try a different state
generally in the direction of it and it
pops in one place
Texas Cowboys come from Texas so if you
turn the auto snap off it doesn't you
you can't just it won't automatically
snap into place until that the child
drops it on Targ Soulja Georgia crows
tasty peaches so that is generally the
only options except for voice off voice
on music on music off so pretty much
that is the extent of the customizations
which is good for a little kid I did
find that my my daughter tended to open
the different menus and stuff
accidentally while she was playing with
it generally she enjoyed it very much
the only things that ended up coming up
kind of funny was if you look up here I
live in Seattle Washington and the state
of Washington actually isn't shaped
anything like that it has a big
Peninsula on the on the left side of the
state which doesn't show on here even
though most of the states on here are
pretty accurate I mean Texas looks
identical Alaska's a little bit
differently because they change the
archipelago into a long Peninsula on
here but otherwise every other state
looks very accurate except for
Washington State so I thought that was
kind of funny and I don't know that my
daughter would ever catch on to that
until she was in school the only other
one that I thought was kind of funny was
some of the different facts about the
state's made my daughter ask a question
or two or should repeat him when
Virginia came up it said Virginia's
where tobacco comes from and she said
tobacco and had to kind of a question
I'm like now she's she's three years old
I'm not going to bother explaining to
her what tobacco is but other than that
all the other facts did seem pretty
relevant there are a couple of them that
were state birds and state flowers
things like that but I think there was
another one that just
what kind of state it was I don't think
was Texas but got out of a lone star
state kind of thing otherwise the kids
Maps application was really enjoyable
for her and I do like the fact that when
you put it into the alphabetical mode
alphabetical Alabama Alabama starts with
an A Alabama's state flower is the
camellia so you can see that it tells
the child every single state so I'd say
Nevada starts with an N and so it's a
good way to you know assist them in
learning their alphabet also on top of
geography I know that my daughter really
liked the the puzzle pattern of it where
she is able to match shapes and that's
where she really enjoyed it the most
overall this application being a dollar
99 on the android market did seem like
it was worth it and my daughter did
enjoy it two dollars worth and i gotta
say i as a parent i recommend it for
anyone who has a child and a honeycomb
tablet because i have looked around
quite a bit for learning applications
for honeycomb tablets and i didn't find
a whole lot of them that i was very
impressed with and i know that when it
comes to the quality of applications on
things like the ipad they do have quite
a bit of good educational applications
and i was very impressed with the kids
maps app i gotta say i recommend i
recommend it and thanks for tuning the
review definitely check back with us in
the future for more application reviews</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
