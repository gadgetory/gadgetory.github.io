authority now when a smartphone maker
designs a phone he has to choose from a
variety of different components
including what screen is going to use
what battery is going to be used and of
course what processor is going to be
used
now these processors really make up the
heart of a smart phone and there are a
variety of them available today from
Qualcomm and from Samsung and from media
tech and from high silicon as a Sid
Barry owned by Huawei and today we're
going to look to see which of these
companies makes the best processor for
your smartphone so if you're ready let's
go now before we go any further we need
to look at what makes up these
processors actually their full name is a
system on a chip or a sock and the
reason they called that is because in
days gone by really just the CPU the
central processing unit was the most
important thing in a computer and all
the other things that it needed to work
were kind of put on other chips around
it on the circuit board in fact even
back in the days of the 386 and 486 even
the floating-point unit the FPU was
considered as a sort of secondary trip
you could buy a PC with or without an
FPU in it now slowly over the years
different things got put onto the same
die as the CPU so first of all it was
the FPU and then memory controllers and
then the GPU and now DSPs until you get
in fact a whole system on a chip and
that's why we get the term of course
system on a chip now we're going to
looking today at five different system
on a chip so first of all we're looking
at the Snapdragon 810 from Qualcomm
Samsung's Exynos 7420
mediate exhales x10 then we can look at
the high silicon carrier 935 and of
course we can also look at the
Snapdragon 801 for comparison with
exception in the Snapdragon 801 which
we'll look at in a moment all the
processes we're going to be looking at
today are octa-core processors that use
a system called big dot little from arm
now in a big dot little system you'll
find that all the calls are not equal
some cause are higher performance some
cores have better power efficiency if
you look at a proselyte the Snapdragon
810 what you'll find is that it has four
cortex 8:57 cores for the heavy lifting
and four cortex a53 cores for the easier
stuff like
flicking through the UI or watching a
YouTube video now there are some
variations on this theme for example -
of the process we're going to be looking
at today in fact use 8 cortex a53 cores
and I'll tell you about those when we
get into the details of each processor
and we're also going to be looking at
the Snapdragon 801 which really was the
peak of the 32-bit processor development
by Qualcomm all the other process we're
looking at our 64-bit processors whereas
the 801 was a quad-core process or not
not octa-core and it was 32 bit and not
64-bit however it provides us with a
good baseline so we can see what was
possible yes the year and what is
possible today because the 801 was a
very popular chip and we'll talk more
about that when we get to it
in a moment and before we dive into
chips to see what each one is capable of
doing it's also meant worth mentioning a
thing called the fabrication process of
course making silicon chips is actually
a quite a hard thing to do
it actually takes several weeks to make
one of these chips from wafer all the
way through to a product that could be
sent on to the market as you can imagine
the small we have to make these chips
the harder it is for the manufacturers
now way back when chips were released
back in the 1970s they were using quite
different process technology technology
to make the chips than we use today now
for example in 1989 they were using an
800 nanometer process for chips like the
Intel 486 now by 2001 that had dropped
to what was known as 130 nanometer
process and that was used by companies
like Intel and Texas Instruments for a
variety of processes including the
Pentium 3 by the time the smartphone
revolution was under the way chips like
the Samsung zenus 3 using the original
Nexus S were made using a 45 nanometer
technology and today that number is down
to 28 nanometers and 14 nanometers fin
fit now the key thing about process
nodes is that although they get harder
and harder to reach these smaller and
smaller targets there are benefits in
making the chips on this smaller process
node including the fact they produce
less heat and consume less power
so therefore of course the smartphone
manufacturers want to get their foes
to smaller and smaller process nodes and
as we go through each chip in a moment
I'll tell you what process node they
have been made on and that is also an
interesting figure and interesting
statistic in how well these chips
perform when we come to the benchmarks
let's talk about the Qualcomm Snapdragon
810 for a moment as I mentioned
previously it's an optical processor not
to a 64-bit processor that uses four
cortex 857 cores and four cortex a53
calls those cores are joined by the
Adreno 430 GPU as well as a DSP and an
LTE modem for all that cellular
communication now the history of the
Snapdragon 810 has been rocky at best
because originally when it was released
it was accused of having problems with
overheating
now Qualcomm released the Snapdragon 810
version 2.1 saying that these problems
have been solved and to the major part
it seems that it has been able to
convince manufacturers to pick its CPU
as you'll find it in phones like the
Sony Zed 5 range and also in the Nexus
6p one final thing worth mentioning
about the Snapdragon 810 is manufactured
using a 20 nanometer process node and
we'll see how that compares to the other
processors in a moment so let's talk
about the Exynos 7420
and this is Samsung's homegrown chip
again that uses four cortex 857 cores
four cortex a53 calls however this time
with a Mali
760 GPU with eight shaders built into it
it's manufactured using a 14 nanometer
FinFET process and Samsung have put it
in their current range of flagship
phones including the Samsung Galaxy s6
the Samsung Galaxy s6 edge the Plus
version of those and of course the note
5 now the next protesser in our lineup
is a bit different
the mediatek helio x10 actually uses 8
cortex a53 cores so it hasn't got any
8:57 cause it's all made up of a 53
cores but four of those cores are
clocked at a higher megahertz then the
other four and therefore it tries to
simulate this kind of big dot little
system by having four that can run
faster and four that from run slower
even though they are actually the same
core design now another interesting
thing about the
Helio x10 is that it uses a GPU from
imagination particularly the power VR
6200 now imagination doesn't have too
much success in the Android space
however it has lots of success in
Apple's product because basically all of
the current iPhones have used the power
VR system from imagination so it'll be
interesting to see how this chip
performs compared to the others it's
also worth mentioning that it uses a 28
nanometer process node and that's quite
big compared to the 14 nanometer FinFET
and the 20 nanometer systems of the
Exynos 7420 and of course the Snapdragon
810 so let's see how that performs when
we get to our benchmarks now the last
octa-core processor in our lab today is
the high silicon killing 9 3 5 not high
silicon is a company that's wholly owned
by Huawei and it's mainly used in quire
ways products including the main test
which is in fact the phone why are we
using for these tests but I'll talk more
about that in a moment
now like the mediatek helio x10 the
keyring 935 uses 8 cortex a53 cores for
them clocked at a higher frequency than
the other four and therefore simulating
this big dot little system now joining
those cores is the arm moly
t-62 8 GPU which has 4 cpu shaders it's
also worth mentioning that this
particular processor is built also on a
28 nanometer process I've also included
one more chip in our test lineup for
today and that is the Snapdragon 801 now
it really is quite different to the
other processes I've just mentioned
first of all it's only a quad core
processor rather than octa-core
processor secondly it doesn't use big
dot little because it only got those
quad cores thirdly it is a 32-bit
processor rather than 64-bit processor
and finally it uses called combs custom
core design rather than using a design
from arm itself and it will be
interesting to see how this chip stands
up in the benchmarks compared to today's
flagship devices so if you're ready
let's take a look at the actual
benchmarks and see what we find out now
to perform these tests I had to get hold
of some devices that use the different
system on the chips that we are testing
now for the Snapdragon 810 I'm using a
so
is 8/5 compact for the Exynos 7420 I'm
using a note 5 for the mediatek helio
x10 I'm using a redmi note 2 for the
keyring 935 I'm using a huawei mate s
and for the Snapdragon 801 I'm using it
sucked as a t1 or as a you K Z one now
one caveat of course is that different
phones may utilize these SOC better than
other phones
however these the phones that I have I
don't think that any difference between
one model and another model with the
same SOC will really affect the overall
results I think we do get a clearer
picture of how these different SOC s
perform now talking of the benchmark
it's actually quite difficult to do
real-world benchmarking although I will
be using programs like antutu and
Geekbench and another program called CP
u prime benchmark which calculates prime
numbers ok you'll find that a lot of
these benchmarks are artificial they
create a kind of a design artificial
workload that you won't see in real life
hoping they do tell us what the CPU and
the GPU is capable of so I've also
included some real-world tests which
includes running Need for Speed
No Limit to see how quickly it starts up
also to run a web browser test using the
Kraken JavaScript benchmark and I've
also written two benchmarks myself one
which performs lots lots of mathematical
calculations another one that performs a
2d physics water simulation to see how
well these phones perform without using
the standard benchmarks because who
knows maybe they even cheat has that
been heard of
they even cheat when they see these
benchmarks but they can't cheat on the
ones I've written myself so let's first
of all start and see how antutu fares on
all these different devices now I ran
two and two two benchmarks on each of
these devices first I ran it when each
phone was cool hadn't been doing
anything probably just been rebooted and
then I ran it to get a base mark level
of performance for each of these
SOC s I then let FX Hitler run in its
guided tour mode for 30 minutes with the
hope that it might heat up the phone a
little bit and then I ran antutu again
to see whether the heat had affected the
performance and these are the results
that we got and as you can see the
Exynos
four-twenty is the fastest CPU according
to and - - next comes the Snapdragon 810
followed by the Kiran 935 and then
interesting enough by the Snapdragon 801
which manages to beat the hell yo x10 by
quite a margin as you can see after I
ran Epic Citadel for 30 minutes the
benchmarks have changed now there are
two interesting things here first of all
the Snapdragon 801 actually performed
better when it was slightly warmed up
the ki-rin 935 managed to maintain its
performance level and the other three or
dip slightly however even with these
changes the Exynos 7420 is still the
fastest processor according to and - -
now the next benchmark Iran was
Geekbench now each page gives us two
numbers first of all gives us a single
core number which means the test is
running just one core on the phone it
doesn't matter when you got octa-core or
a Decker core or a quad core phone it
will only use one core to run the test
that will tell us how fast each
individual core is it then also gives us
a multi-core score which means it farms
out the benchmark across all the calls
in the processor and tells us what speed
can be achieved there and just like with
the antutu benchmark what I actually did
was after Iran air FX into the upper 30
minutes I then ran and - - and then very
quickly I also ran Geekbench to see how
the Heat had affected the overall
outcome let's have a look at the results
as you can see for the single core
results again the Exynos 7420 is the
fastest with a score of 1504 this is
followed by again the Snapdragon 810 and
then this time again we see the
Snapdragon 801 is performing very well
followed by the Helio x10 and the kidron
nine three five now again after epics
develop in running for 30 minutes I
reran the tests we can see the
Snapdragon 810 actually did marginally
better as did the Snapdragon 801
however the Exynos 7420 remained
basically the same as did the Helio x10
with a slight dip only on the Kiran 935
as for the multi-core results again we
see the Exynos 7420 is the fastest
processor according to the multi-core
part or Geekbench however interestingly
we find that the Helio x10 has a very
good score and in fact beats the
Snapdragon
10 which comes into third place fourth
we have the quirian 935 and finally the
Snapdragon 801 which only is a quad-core
processor and therefore doesn't do so
well on a multi-core test now again
after running Epic Citadel for 30
minutes I went away and ran and - - and
then ran Geekbench and again we can see
that some of the numbers are quite
interesting again the Snapdragon 801 d
better after had been heated up the
keyring 935 Auto did better after it
been playing Epic Citadel the other
three had dropped slightly but again it
remains that the Exynos 7420
is the fastest CPU according to
Geekbench and the Helio x10 comes in at
second place now for this third test I
use CPU Prime mark a program that just
calculates lots and lots of prime
numbers and sees how quickly the SOC can
do it now this time to heat up the
process of what I did was I made the
initial run and then I recorded 10
minutes of HD video not 4k video HD
video on each phone and then reran the
test to see whether the heat produced by
recording HD video change the result it
took up tall and of course it has so
let's have a look at them and as you can
see the Exynos 7420 is again the fastest
processor according to cpu prime
benchmark next comes a Snapdragon 810
then we have the Helio x10 followed by
the ki-rin 935 and finally the
Snapdragon 801 now after recording HD
video for 10 minutes we find that some
of the scores altered but some of the
schools didn't significantly change at
all for example the Exynos 7420 remains
basically the same and in fact the
killing 935 does slightly better and the
Snapdragon 801 remains basically the
same the only one that dropped
significantly was the Snapdragon 810
which we see had quite a big drop from
20,000 271 to 18,000 935 now an attempt
to reproduce real-world situations
real-world scenarios rather than relying
on benchmarks I did a test where I
started up the game Need for Speed No
Limit actually takes quite a few seconds
to start up that game and I measured it
on each of the devices to see how well
they did now hear the results the
slowest for starting up the game was in
fact the Snapdragon 810 which was quite
unusual compared
to the other things we've seen the other
benchmarks that we've seen the fastest
of course was the external 7 420 but it
was matched by the keyring 935 in the
huawei mate s and then you get very
close the mediatek helio x10 and the
Snapdragon 801 both at 33 and 34 seconds
respectively so there's obviously quite
a big difference between the Exynos 7420
at 28 seconds compared to the Snapdragon
810 at 43 seconds now as a caveat some
other things that come into play here
example how fast is the flash memory on
the particular device so although this
does give us a real-world test it isn't
purely just about the SOC there are
other factors including however still
the Exynos 7420 in the note 5 comes out
fastest now we all use our smartphones
for web browsing and how well our smart
phone can handle webpages how well it
can handle javascript is very important
therefore I ran each phone through a
test called Kraken which is a JavaScript
performance test to see how well each
one performed and let's look at the
graph now in this particular graph
shorter is better as we can see the
external 7420 again comes out top
followed by that is the Snapdragon 810
with a very good close score in fact
then you'll find the Snapdragon 801
performing excellently here and a pretty
bad showing by the Helio x10 and the
cueing 935 which are almost double in
fact almost triple some of the scores
from the other processors found to be
benchmarks are ones that I wrote myself
the first one is more of a mathematical
bra power one let's see how well the
process is doing things like calculating
sha-1 hashes or finding prime numbers or
doing a bubble sort on a very very large
table now after all these things are
done the time that it took to perform
all those tasks is displayed and it's
displayed in milliseconds so let's have
a look to see what the results are now
interestingly enough the Snapdragon 810
came out top in this particular set of
tests with a score of 22,000 937 a
remember shorter is better because it
did it quicker in this particular set of
tests this was then followed by the
Exynos 7420 followed then by the
Snapdragon 801 not the first time it's
in third place it still is a very good
processor and then followed by the
quirian 935 and in last place the Helio
x10 that's really quite interesting too
the result Snapdragon 810 came out top
Snapdragon 801 came in third and the
Exynos 7420 stuck there in the middle
between the two now the final of my
custom benchmarks which I wrote is one
that uses a 2d physics engine to
simulate water filling up a container
now the idea is that every frame a new
drop of water is added into the
container and the physics engine and the
CPU need to process all of that physics
information to see how the container
fills up now the program is designed to
run at 60 frames per second over a 90
second interval that means a maximum
5,400 drops of water can be added to the
container
now when the SOC cannot keep up with all
that work frames will be dropped and
drops of water will not be added into
the container so the maximum score is
5,400 and will now see how well those
phones did in comparison to each other
let's have a look at the graph now the
Exynos 7420 did the best with five
thousand three hundred and fifty nine to
almost manage full speed but not quite
next you have the Snapdragon 801 again
performing very very well with five
thousand three hundred and forty four
then you have the Helio x10 coming in at
five thousand two hundred and fifty five
very close to that was a Snapdragon 810
but it's a fourth-place showing for this
particular SOC this time and finally the
weakest of the bunch for this particular
test was the killing nine three five so
does all this mean well first of all I
want to talk about the Snapdragon 801 it
really did a great job in fact it
performed really well against these
octa-core 64-bit processors in fact if I
had to choose between a phone with a
low-end 64-bit processor let's say the
Snapdragon 410 or the Snapdragon 801 I
think I would go with the 801 every time
still got lots of life in it and I'm
sure we're going to see it in lots of
mid-range and maybe in a couple of years
time in low-end phones that will really
we'll still have a lot of life and a lot
of longevity in them so congratulations
for Cole Krum for the Snapdragon 801
however when it comes to the Snapdragon
810 and the Exynos 7420 the samsung
processor is clearly the winner
I think the
Sampson Prasad won almost all of the
benchmarks and really the Snapdragon 810
came in behind it but it always was just
that little bit slower and as for the
other two there's not much to to choose
between them the helios x10 and the kiri
935 are pretty much evenly matched
throughout these different benchmarks
sometimes one was better than the other
but overall I think it's are probably
they're good processors for mid-range
phones maybe mid high-end phones and so
in a nutshell the external 7 420 is the
best processor out there at the moment
for Android devices the Snapdragon 810
comes in close behind it and then in
joint third place will find the keyring
935 and the Helio x10 but don't forget
about the Snapdragon 801 it's still got
lots of life in it well my name is Gary
Sims from Android authority I hope you
enjoyed this benchmarking video today if
we did please do give it a thumbs up
also please don't forget to subscribe to
and rathore ''tis youtube channel you'll
find links here above for subscribing to
the YouTube channel and for social media
also don't forget to check out what my
colleagues Android Authority are doing
with the videos that are linked here on
the side
now as for me I'll see you in my next
video
now the lasted at least a little bit a
little loop so I'm sure we'll see more
and more in mid-range phones and it
maybe in a year or two in low-end phone
and it real really will rule it a little
early and then close behind it is the
Snapdragon 810 which although it didn't
really really</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
