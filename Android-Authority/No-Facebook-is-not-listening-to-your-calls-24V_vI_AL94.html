nightmare and the latest scare has
people believing that the social network
is eavesdropping on your conversations
Kelly Byrnes a professor of mass
communications at the University of
South Florida recently suggested that
Facebook could be using your phone's
microphone to listen in on your
conversation and surroundings
but Facebook quickly addressed this
issue by clearing things up with new
sources and writing a blog post
regarding the matter here's what they
had to say Facebook does not use your
phone's microphone to inform ads or to
change what you see in the newsfeed some
recent news articles have suggested that
we must be listening to people's
conversations in order to show them
relevant ads this is not true we show
ads based on people's interests and
other profile information not what
you're talking about aloud now Facebook
goes on to mention that some features do
listen to your surroundings but they
don't record anything and they don't
actually use this information to decide
what type of ads are being displayed
they grab all the data from other parts
of your profile and I quote we only
access your microphone if you have given
our app permission and if you are
actively using a specific feature that
requires audio this might include
recording a video or using an optional
feature we introduced two years ago to
include music or other audio in your
status updates now if you're still
worried you can easily restrict the
Facebook app from using your microphone
by simply going to settings apps gear
button microphone and then toggle
Facebook apps off Facebook spying on
both you and me is no surprise to anyone
by now companies like Google and
Facebook pretty much know everything
about us but listening in on out loud
conversations reaches a new level that
no one is comfortable with thankfully
Facebook is not there yet at least so
they claim we do have tech that is
listening all the time such as Amazon
echo speaker now you long term viewers
will know that I've interviewed scores
of web developers also people from
hacker schools and one of the biggest
indications of success is having a
portfolio that can demonstrate your
worth and your skill set and our sponsor
Full Sail University can help you build
just that with the mobile development
undergraduate degree you'll learn how to
both create and distribute apps if
you're ready to advance your development
skills check out the mobile gaming
graduate program if you're ready to
compete in this rapidly growing industry
visit Full Sail edu forward slash
authority to learn more so how do you
feel about technology that is always
listening are you ok with it if not
where do you draw the line
