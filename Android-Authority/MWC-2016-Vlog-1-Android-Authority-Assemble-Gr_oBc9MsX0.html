here look it's about five to five in the
morning I'm really really tired and then
we'll meet hija airport and I've never
seen it look white as dead is this it's
completely empty and this is me when I'm
Chad but yeah let Barcelona finally
begin mwc is here for another year and
it's going to be a damn good show anyway
i'm about to go use the lounge and i'll
see you in it I've see you on the other
side
delay
when they were swabbing with that little
piece of paper whatever it is all of the
stuff that's in my duffel bag over here
and in my big think tank bag over here
it kept coming up with a residue warning
on the actual display it would literally
say explosives detectives a demolitions
expert actually came in these two
military guys who came in and inspected
every little piece that was inside of
both of these bags I travel with all of
this stuff all of the time and I have no
idea why it would even trigger that
warning this time around and for the
life of me I can't figure out why it
happened I just had to go through all of
that crap but i will say that when the
alarms go off tsa you guys actually
spring into action I obviously wouldn't
have anything in my bags that would
cause problems and the people the
demolitions people actually said you
know we usually just do this for someone
with reasonable doubt that's obviously
not the case here it's just that the
machine keeps flagging you that's
exactly what happened
so I actually forgot to vlog the entire
first half of this trip but I'm
currently in Munich right now it's a 7am
Kansas City time is midnight so three
big difference looking forward to
getting there and getting settled in
because uh yeah getting a little bit
tired and is it weird that I'm already
homesick
I made it I made it and I got my bed and
I'm tired barev and Chris velasco
actually who's with him I think I don't
know how they took the same plane
they're on their way out also so I'll
just be chillin and waiting for them
seven ultimate vlogging Stallman oh and
I really did like so there's gonna be a
about 15 second clip of me just dancing
that's fine
so this is the second apartment that we
have in Barcelona this is where we're
sort of stashing the bosses so that we
don't have to stay like that hahaha yeah
so Darcy Derek hope you guys have fun
here alright and this is the main
apartment lon is right here or have you
