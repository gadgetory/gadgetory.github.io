and first look at a phone by blue now
blue is bringing unique unlock phones to
the table at a very affordable rate
today we're taking a look at a phone
that arguably has one of the largest
batteries you can get at a whopping five
thousand milliamp I'm Kevin the tech
ninja and this is a blue studio energy
review
the blue has a five thousand milliamp
battery and you're reminded of that
every moment you hold the phone
more and more OEMs are looking to push
the envelope on how thin you can make a
phone and this one does the opposite and
surprisingly enough it's refreshing this
phone isn't made to turn any heads but
it's made for one thing and that's
battery life it's a no frills type of
phone and you can tell by the body the
right side has the chrome textured
volume rocker and power button USB port
at the bottom the headphone jack which
is shifted to the left at the top the
removable back houses a 8 megapixel
shooter flash speaker grille and the
blue logo the materials are mixed
between matte plastic and glossy plastic
with a little bit of chrome plating have
a glossy plastic which is found mostly
on the sides of the device is pretty
slick the capacitive buttons are located
on the chin of the device the Menu
button to the left home in the middle
and the back arrow is to the right in
the hand it feels solid and that's
mostly due to the weight the energy
display brings you a 5 inch 720p IPS LCD
screen this screen can produce up to 16
million colors these colors don't
necessarily pop off the panel but
provides you enough color to give you a
satisfactory image at 291 PPI it
provides you with enough sharpness to
zoom in on text and also see most
details on images the viewing angles are
not that bad but it does lose saturation
quickly if you are used to high-end
phones you notice the resolution is much
lower this comes into play when viewing
media especially and your authority
videos the details that makes HD look
fantastic will not be there for normal
day-to-day use like web browsing the
screen is just fine staying true to its
name the energy display is very power
friendly even with the brightness
cranked all the way up the display seems
a bit dim something you really would
have noticed unless you're in direct
sunlight during this review I was in the
scorching Detroit Sun and I had to find
shade a few times to even see my
overall it's a very powerfully display
and this can attribute directly to
battery life the star of the show for
the energy is obviously it's flopping
5,000 milliamp battery I'm sure adds a
significant amount of weight which makes
the phone tip the scale at 180 grams as
far as the processing power we are
looking at the quad-core 1.3 gigahertz
cortex a7 which according to arm is the
most power efficient multi-core
processor for graphics the GPU is a Mali
400 which once again is designed for
battery longevity as far as memory the
energy brings you 1 gigabyte of RAM 8
gigabytes of internal memory and also up
to 64 gigabytes of expandable memory via
micro sd under the back cover we have
access to our dual SIM card slot and the
bottom data port is a USB 2.0 the camera
onboard is a modest eight megapixel
autofocus shooter with LED flash the
front-facing camera comes in at two
megapixels if the main objective of the
blue studio energy is to provide awesome
battery life that has potential to last
up to 48 hours on a single charge then
the blue has succeeded but if their
objective was to provide a great
performance at the same time well blue
may have fell a bit short I do
appreciate that blue is able to pump out
devices for such an affordable rate and
maybe I need to scale back expectations
a bit but the device as a whole is
sluggish even with minimal applications
installed just using hangouts the
keyboard has a hard time keeping up with
me since the device has one gigabyte of
RAM multitasking is a bit slower than
other devices but it does the job one of
the main pain points I'm having is
pulling down the notification bar
there's been many times it just does not
register my finger swipes and there
really isn't anything I can't do with
this phone but just things are a bit
slower on a good note the Mali GPU does
a great job with most games I throw at
it many of the games in the Play Store I
ran as any flagship device would the
only time I did see slowdown is when
playing high-end games like dead trigger
or modern combat
those games did provide and consistent
experience and that experience was
slowness during this whole review I load
it to power friendly components to
achieve better battery life I know
you're wondering if these decisions paid
off in the long run well I can easily
say yes I'm able to get over 48 hours
off the charger with over 6 hours of
screen on time comfortably that means
without making major adjustments to my
day-to-day use I'm on Wi-Fi most of the
day and I do my fair share of google
play music and Spotify I might open the
occasional game and even if you don't
get 48 hours it's still nice to know
that at the end of a long day you're not
digging for a charger this is the fresh
breath of air for me I really wish omlt
leap by making their phones thicker for
better battery life but we're in the
generation of keeping up with the
Joneses and right now the Joneses have
the thinnest phone but let's keep things
in perspective this is a budget-friendly
device that is designed for extreme
battery life and it does a mighty fine
job at providing that for you the blue
studio energy comes with Android 4.4.2
kitkat on the surface appears to be
running a stock version of Android but
once you slide down the notification bar
you can see that it's running custom
software on top of Android the
notification panel is very similar to
standard Android although provides a few
tweaks for example to clear all
notifications there's an X on the top
right corner also there is a tab for
settings in the settings tab is where
you'll find quick settings there's also
a ram widget here that lets you clear
off a ram with one press since the
device only has one gigabyte of ram you
may be visiting this section often when
digging into the options you'll run
across different settings one of my
favorites is the guest mode when guest
mode is enabled logs messages photos and
other sources of personal information
will be hidden to disable this you need
to provide a password quick Power Save
mode is also found in these settings
regardless I don't use quick power-save
mode much since the battery life is
already stellar but I'm all for any mode
that can give you additional battery if
needed on most mid-level devices the
camera is one thing that usually takes a
backseat is this true with the blue well
let's take a look at the software first
the camera on the blue is very simple
the interface is clean with not many
options we have the shutter button to
the left a toggle from video to photo
flash camera selection and a more
Settings button
images produced by the blue are very
flat they lack a lot of color this wall
as seen in this image actually has a
deeper color than what's being shown
many images appear to be overexposed and
lack dynamic range I took this phone to
a restaurant and I attempted to take a
picture of this drink over 10 times and
this is the best image I came up with
and still it's not in focus the selfie
camera is only 2 megapixels and as
expected the images look really bad this
was outside in good lighting so once I
took the front-facing camera indoors the
images remained the same overexposed in
some areas lack of color and overall
just grainy the energy is packed with
shooting modes within the settings the
gesture based shots are pretty cool you
can set it up to take an image when you
smile or when you make a peace sign also
the usual suspects are found in the
camera software like panorama HDR and
sport mode however the quantity of
shooting modes cannot hide the poor
quality of the images and there it is
guys that was the review of the blue
Studio energy as I mentioned before this
phone is made for extreme battery life
and it succeeds at that goal plus the
phone is a hundred and fifty US dollars
so at that price it's a definite steal
especially for the long battery make
