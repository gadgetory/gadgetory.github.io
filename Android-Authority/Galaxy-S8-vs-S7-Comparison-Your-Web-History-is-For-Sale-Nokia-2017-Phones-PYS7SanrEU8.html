know Kia fans out there and for those of
you who still have insatiable cravings
for rumors on the Galaxy s8 I'm your
huckleberry in a statement sent to Nokia
power user
a spokesperson for hmd said that the
current plan for Nokia is to launch the
Nokia six five and three phones in a
hundred and twenty markets all at the
same time in second quarter 2017 that's
between April and June hmd first
launched the Nokia six in China earlier
this year clove in the UK has already
stated that it will sell the Nokia 5 and
3 in May followed by the Nokia 6 in June
now when will the u.s. be getting these
phones while responding to a question
from a fan the nokia official Mobile
Twitter account stated and I quote we're
planning on a global release so yes
there will be by the way don't look for
a new version of the Nokia 3310 feature
phone to be released in the US at least
for a while
the phone uses 2g networks which are no
longer available in the US it's possible
HMD could release a newer version of the
phone in the future that will be
compatible with modern US cellular
networks now if you all recall the
coverage that we had of the Nokia
devices at their Mobile World Congress
our team was really impressed with the
build quality and the fact that these
phones were running stock nougat now
when it comes to the Samsung Galaxy
eight leaks and rumors you'd think that
we know almost everything there is to
know and we think we do but look at the
size comparison as you can see from the
images here the galaxy s 8 dummy unit
confirms what we already know there will
be a physical home button located right
below the volume rocker for Samsung's
recently announced Bigsby the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack is here to
stay thank God and the usual microUSB
port has been replaced by USB type-c
port the front is very clean looking due
to the fact that the front fingerprint
scanner has been moved to the back of
the device what intrigues us even more
however is the size comparison in the
video
given that the rumored screen size of
the 5.8 inches and the 6.2 inches
some people may be worried that
new Galaxy S devices will be unwieldly
but judging by the size comparison shown
here it looks like the s8 will in fact
be narrower than the s7 with a 5.1 inch
screen and the s8 plus narrower than the
note 7 man yeah but 6.2 inches is
getting into like mini tablet range now
I know I know the whole privacy and
security issue
is getting exhausting people are getting
tired of it but I feel like I'm not
doing my public duty if we don't talk
about this again because the US Senate
is trying to make it easier to sell your
web history to advertisers yeah last
October the Federal Communications
Commission the FCC approved Internet
privacy rules that would ban Internet
Service Providers ISPs from sharing or
selling your web browsing data to
advertisers without your consent
unfortunately the US Senate has recently
voted to eliminate these privacy rules
which means that your browsing data
might soon make its way to companies who
are willing to pay for it
the decision isn't official yet as the
house needs to approve it first and even
if it does President Trump has the power
to keep the rules in place by issuing a
veto Senator Richard Blumenthal is just
one of many who are not very happy about
these rules he said that they are direct
attacks on consumer rights as well as
privacy senator ed markey took things to
another level by saying that ISPs now
stand for quote information sold for
profit unquote an invading subscriber
privacy he also added that every
American should be alarmed by the
violation of privacy that these changes
will bring if you really want to educate
yourself and not be one of the sheeple
read this book my 16 year old twin boys
are reading this book in English class
right now and it is a classic this book
is referred to countless times through
popular culture you got to read it
educate yourself 1984 it's all about
this meet Jeremy shoemaker otherwise
known as shoe money and he became famous
for this photo
where he showed off a cheque that he
made from Google Adsense and he's become
so good at making online business
is that he made an announcement that he
does not start a new business unless he
can secure the businesses name in a.com
now why is that exactly
well no domain name extension tells your
story with the same degree of trust as a
dot-com or dotnet domain name.com and
dotnet domain name extensions and jet
credibility and your online presence and
who doesn't want to be credible and
