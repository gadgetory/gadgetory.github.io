that 500 million of you yahoo users need
to change your password right now
because you've been hacked according to
Yahoo by a state-sponsored actor and
this was done two years ago no one
nowhere seems to be asking or answering
the painfully obvious question why are
we only hearing about this now two days
ago yahoo released an unassuming
bulletin entitled an important message
about yahoo user security in it they
revealed that a massive data breach had
taken place in 2014 a hack that
contained compromising information of a
half a billion of Yahoo's users yahoo
says that the culprit behind this crime
is quote a state-sponsored actor a quote
state-sponsored actor means that Yahoo
is accusing some government we don't
know who of hacking their information
now it should be said that bcrypt is a
very strong encryption method so
passwords may be safe although that's
not much of a comfort I'm sure to yahoo
users so why why only tell us now did
you only find out about this recently
and if so that says a lot about your
security or did you know about it and
for some nefarious reason decided not to
tell us and only now well that's a good
question because let me tell you that
private information your private
information has been on the black market
to be bought and sold for nefarious
purposes that should be a concern you
should be upset it's pretty upsetting to
me so when this happens and you don't
explain why you don't answer an obvious
question people like me have to
speculate so I'm going to speculate what
has happened recently well Yahoo is
negotiating a deal with verizon to sell
to verizon which is really only or
Yahoo's only exit that's their only big
play right now years ago what four years
ago now however long it was Marissa
Meyer took over a CEO of Yahoo it was a
hope there was a big hope that she could
innovate do some product innovation and
really revolutionize the company to come
back to its former glory days that
hasn't happened so much so the only real
play now is to sell big to sell to a big
player like Verizon so if i was working
for horizon and i was an industrial
espionage or I was a lawyer I was an
operative for verizon all these big
company have operatives like this I
would leak this information after I know
it just before the final sale to affect
the sale to bring that cost down to have
any evidence to that fact no but yahoo
has not provided us any other
information so we got to speculate we
got to answer it because users like you
are obviously going to ask that question
I'm asking that question and I read the
article I read the the PR the press
release that Yahoo put out nothing not
even a boo about it so is that it I
think that probably has something to do
with it let me know what you think in
the comments below but before we go we
should state the obvious that you need
to change your password and you need to
change them now and if you're one of the
fifty nine percent of the people in the
world that use the same password for all
your accounts across platforms I'm sure
many of you geeks are like that but if
you are change all your passwords change
them now I think it's safe to say that
pretty much everyone hates day-to-day
