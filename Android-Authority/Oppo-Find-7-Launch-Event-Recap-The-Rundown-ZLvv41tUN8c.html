thought hey what's going on everybody
and I'm here with Darcy lack of a of
course and the two of us made the
journey to Beijing China 12-hour flight
how long was your flight
it took me like 36 hours to get here the
word find is right there because we're
here for the launch of the Oppo find 7
now before we get into it we'll just say
it right off the bat we are damn excited
for this phone
we always love what Oppo is putting out
there and they've they're very very kind
and we really love hanging out with them
and now we have a launch of a phone that
really excites us for a number of
different reasons but first we're gonna
talk about the show and I did record a
lot of it you're gonna see a lot of roll
of the of the show itself and it was
just a spectacular show you can see the
lights behind us we have this blue hue
and everything he's crazy but we'll talk
about the show labelled that Darcy
started off with that well I mean the
translators unfortunately were broken
but we had a chance to attend a
previewing with Oppo the day before it's
really interesting when you have you
know smaller players in the industry
that are bringing technological
leadership in the form of 2560 by 1440
5.5 inch 538 pixels per inch displays
you know and like faster charging with
that vo see technology as a 7 pin 75%
thirty minutes kind of thing and I mean
it's just to me Oppo is a company that
has considerable foresight you know and
offers really remarkable tech for pretty
compelling price points so yes yeah
we're talking about the venue a little
bit it's just they they usually have
chairs without backs I always complain
about that every time well but after
that you know it's just a spectacular
light show you'll see footage right now
that the phones actually came from the
ceiling and then and then for about five
to ten minutes the the everyone just
swarmed all of the devices and I sat
right next to one so I was pretty much
almost trampled by all of the people
trying to take pictures of it and then
I'll just a showcasing of everything of
course an Asian phone lunch will not be
complete without a nice cheesy
commercial to accompany it there - yeah
there are two or two-and-a-half in a way
something incredible like that super
funny but super fun to watch and really
showcase all of the capabilities of the
phone even if you know
it's a little cheesy we laughed for sure
but it was really fun but as far as the
phone itself goes you'll see our hands
on in our first look and we have Darcy
was already naming off some of the
features the fook charging capability
that will get the phone from 0 to 75% in
half an hour which is pretty incredible
but one thing that we will say and I
mentioned it to you it looks like you
have to use a special charger for a day
7 pin that I was just confirmed that
it's a cable that is supplied by Oppo
yes and it will work in regular USB
it's just that they miniaturize it and
added two pins for faster charging so
yeah it will still work with regular USB
but if you want that really fast
charging have to use a proprietary cable
unfortunately now all of the graphics
showed a big block on the other side of
the phone now ago so I first thought
that was just a 2 mm charger and then
they dove into it and there's like MCU
technology in there just a bunch of
circuits a whole bunch of new stuff in
there yeah and it all works in come in
congruence in order to make the super
fast charging time but any other
features of the phone oh I am very
excited about the camera of course being
the photographer of course I want to see
the camera the super zoom technology
that they actually put up on the screen
and so it takes 10 burst shots finds the
best ones out of all of them and creates
from the 13 megapixel optics a 50
megapixel picture in which you can zoom
in now we didn't do this ourselves yet
we're gonna do it ourselves but we saw I
already saw a zoomed in photo to see the
comparison and it does look like it
makes a difference you can tell us
post-processing but it actually makes
the photo look good yeah actually looks
pretty nice weird any other features
that you were super excited about Sochi
from the show that they were showcasing
the show was pretty cool actually I
thought it was great I mean the max
audio you know everyone's pushing their
the Lady Gaga's producer he's got a cool
name he had a really cool hat on he kind
of looks like a version of Mick Jagger
kind of Hollywood he took the trip all
the way from California just like Josh
and you said from Hollywood I was like
Molly would you but regardless I mean
the display it's all about the display
for me and you know Center Grenada one
three years of RAM you know microSD it
accepts the 128 gigabyte as micro SDXC
so
you're gonna be able to have like a
whole whack town you know 148 gigs or
hundred it's just music I mean you know
videos on that screen just saying well
it's the highest PPI display of any
device ever it's a display made by LG
that we're likely seeing the LG g3 but
it's just so cool that you know it's
gonna be hitting the market tomorrow and
you're gonna be able to have you know
that incredible display before like
Samsung before LG before Sony you have a
company out of China
you know that's selling 50 60 million
phones a year that we've been believers
in for a long time and we're gonna
continue to support with coverage and
we're happy to be here you know super
happy to be here we want to extend our
things once again to Opel for just this
great event in general and it just all
was really great and yeah so our flights
out tomorrow and it should be really
great it just wanted to make sure to
bring all of you guys this rundown of
the Oppo events and it was really fun to
bring back the segment also we want you
to be there with us so I hope you
enjoyed the coverage we really did
dignity it dug deep dig deep we really
did dig deep for these videos and I was
actually very proud of that video that
we put together of the hands-on you know
