country that comes to mind when you
think of a premium smartphone
manufacturer but with the smart platinum
7 the UK carrier is making its first
attempt at breaking the high-end
smartphone market at 300 pounds and some
pretty neat features this device done
the real chance of being a flagship
killer but can it live up to that name
to look at the Vodafone smart platinum
7s off to look good it's not great start
it doesn't have quite the same wow
factor as other premium phones then
neither does Google's pixel to be frank
what the Platinum 7 does have is a
professional-looking black finish and a
nice leap at and reflective rear it's
understated but it was quite executive
on the whole the body is made entirely
from metal and glass has thin bezels and
no physical home button on the front the
device could be a little bit slippery
when placed on some surfaces but it
feels very solid in the hand and has a
decent amount of heft
overall the design is fairly by the
numbers but there are a few nice
elements here that are worth mentioning
- one there's a fingerprint sensor
located around the back just below the
camera and just the right height to
reach easily with an index finger also
freezing are the two front facing
speakers and some very nicely textured
buttons along the sides I mean seriously
in some super nice buttons so if it's a
comfy and stylish set of buttons either
on your device then this is the phone
for you oh and you also find one more
button than usual here - the dedicated
camera button so the only slight
downside to the design is the fact that
there's some separations in the
different elements of the device so for
example the split grille the panel
they're on is a slightly different
texture compared to the surrounding area
it's not the end of the world by any
means but it means you don't have that
premium unibody effect that a lot of the
more expensive devices give you overall
it's still more good to bat here in
terms of the looks of the device but it
might just be an acquired taste so it's
the same story of the screen you get a
surprisingly high end panel even if it's
nothing we haven't seen before has a
nice crisp 2k resolution and an AMOLED
at that with that in mind it's no
surprise that it has great color
saturation these blacks are almost blend
into the bezels and decent brightness at
5.5 inches the screen is
they're more than large enough to the
majority of productivity tasks to be
considered a phablet look closely and
you'll notice of the screen is actually
very slightly curved too which is
interesting it describes itself as being
2.5 D but it's not going to be giving
Samsa many sleepless nights it's more
just the screen doesn't quite fit flush
and to me it's actually contributes
slight to the left cohesiveness the
phone but points for trying the phone
performs pretty smoothly which is
largely due to the software rather than
the hardware specs wise the Platinum 7
is slightly underpowered compared with
even last generation flagships they're
not so that you'd notice inside is an
octave core Snapdragon 615 processor
with 4 cores clocked at 1.8 gigahertz
and the other four clocks at 1.2 despite
that navigating around the home screen
is seamless launching apps is snappy and
those numbers should be beastly enough
to handle most games and apps with no
problem more importantly I haven't
experienced any crashes or may discusses
even multitasking is also super smooth
but it probably helps along by the
Welcome 3 gigabytes of RAM and the
relatively start version of Android more
on that in a moment if you want the top
performing Android code on the market
then this is not it so for general use
you shouldn't have any problems and
actually it's pretty slick if you are
interested in the numbers though then
you can check out the results from
Geekbench and c2 and 3d mark here
storage wise will get 32 gigabytes
onboard for happily so the prints or fit
to provide space for microSD cards jeez
another good choice for the phone so we
have an above average screen and average
internal what about the rest of the
hardware so that fingerprint census
doesn't have any fancy tricks you can't
use it to swipe through photos in your
gallery for instance but what makes up
for that is the hardware camera button
so you can use this of course to take
photos which is always convenient or you
can reprogram it to law on turning your
favorite apps and perform other
functions that's always handy the other
highlight in terms of the hardware is
the inclusion of stereo speakers these
always make a big difference and this is
no exception
the vodafone smart flashing m7 is
capable of immersing unit sounds and can
be easily herded to the sound of a
frying pan if you like to watch YouTube
works
the cool quality is also exactly what
you'd accept flash shapes while the
thinking strength has been very reliable
in my testing of course the phone is
locked with Vodafone she'll have to
decide for yourself how you feel about
that
for me the longevity of the 3000
milliamp hour battery is actually one of
the stars of the show here and it's one
of the things that Vodafone is bragging
about the most in its marketing those
bragging rights are earn so and the
battery life here has put many of my
recent phones to shame at the end of a
full day of moderate to heavy use the
smart platinum 7 will generally still
have about 20% battery life that's
pretty impressive especially considering
it's running a quad HD display so if
you're one of the people who's been
bemoaning the lack of battery life in
today's modern phones and you might want
to check out the smart platinum 7
anything they could potentially have
done a bit better would be to include a
replaceable battery we can't have
everything I suppose and even better is
the phone's impressive idle time it can
easily hold its charge overnight and
this quick charging so you can fill up
quickly again when it finally does run
out the camera though lets things down
slightly the rear shooter has plenty of
pixels at 16 megapixels but the results
just can't compete with the top players
there's an F 2.0 aperture but it does
not perform well in low light settings
steps of field effects are distinctly
underwhelming and auto focus needs to
struggle in macro shots photos often
look overexposed and pictures will
awesome feature cloudless white skies
even with HDR turned on at times the
colors look washed out but admittedly I
am a fan of a little hyper real
saturation I'm not saying it's terrible
under the right circumstances it will
pick up a lot of detail and the Apple
TVs using nicely laid out they're coming
from my galaxy s6 edge+
this is just a big step backward after
video you can record it to 160 P at
30fps or 1080p at 60fps there's also a
front-facing 8 megapixel camera capable
of filming at 1080p what better place to
test the cameras in the oxford camera in
the range the vodafone smart platinum 7
will in fact some major points though
with its software choices specifically
Vodafone should be applauded for opting
provider for the pretty much stock
version of Android marshmallow there's
no ugly skin on top of the UI and even
the bloatware a surprisingly restrained
this no doubt helps performance a great
deal and Android purists dispersal to be
very pleasing for choice it all
feels like using a Nexus device so just
housecleaning is Vodafone's top-end
offerings can it really replace the
galaxy or HTC sadly the answer has to be
no for those who really want the best
Android experience the slightly less
future-proof processor is likely to be a
turn-off
everyday users meanwhile may find the
camera a little lackluster for their
taste but for those looking for the
closest thing to a flagship phone for
much lower price this is a very strong
contender indeed there are no sexy
gimmicks this is a very reliable phone
that performance better than average in
almost every capacity so is this phone a
flagship killer it's close but no cigar
it's a great flagship alternative though
and for the price it's really pretty
hard to fault so thanks for watching
