that seems a little more evened out from
the get-go does it continue as you take
a closer look hey Josh of agar from
Andhra Authority what's going on
everybody and this is the Apple iPhone
5s versus the Moto X as far as form
factors ago the Moto X is a closer
competitor to the iPhone 5s than many of
the Android flagships we've been looking
at at 4.7 inches it takes on the sizes
that we used to see last year a market
that has increasingly been associated
with mid-range devices this year
nonetheless Motorola's device takes on a
soft plastic casing that includes the
screen upfront button layout all on one
side and a rounded back the shape of the
back was a very deliberate choice as it
helps the phone rest very comfortably in
the hand as such you get a very easy to
handle device in the Moto X but the
smaller four inch form factor iPhone is
even easier to handle though you do
sacrifice quite a bit of size the 5s
continues the tradition of aluminum
material along with the small yet tall
display the power button is up top with
the rest of the buttons on the side and
an updated home button is up front all
of which are classic iPhone the flat
front and back with rounded sides make
this phone easy to hold in one hand but
of course the size is mostly responsible
for this nonetheless you shouldn't have
any trouble using either phone in one
hand if you really need the smaller
phone just remember what you might be
losing in the process it's in the screen
that entails such a sacrifice in this
4-inch Retina display the iPhone brings
a 11 36 by 640 resolution at 326 PPI
this is essentially the same screen as
the original iPhone 5 and thus brings
the same good performance those who want
a better display experience via higher
resolutions will have to see if the
iPhone offers enough nonetheless the
color reproduction is good especially
for the newly revamped iOS 7 on the
other hand we have the Moto X with this
4.7 inch 720p screen it might not be a
huge increase in resolution here but it
is definitely noticeable considering the
larger screen the AMOLED display
provides great color saturation without
going too far and media consumption is
definitely in its wheelhouse in the end
it comes down to if your eyes require a
larger display the Moto X is not one of
the many 5-inch screen devices out there
but its size is still respectable and
noticeably larger than the iPhone which
is your alternative if 4.7 inches is
somehow still too much for you we
actually get somewhat of a similar story
between these two phones and performance
Apple continues to update their own
processing packages but in the case of
the Moto X it didn't just jump into the
super powerful updated Snapdragon
processor line it sports an updated
Snapdragon s4 pro that is complemented
by the adrenal 320 graphics and finally
a couple of low demand cores made for
specific functions like voice
recognition the f-15 gets an updated
dual-core a7 that is capable of 64-bit
computing which is something that will
become very important in the coming year
nonetheless these two phones are very
speedy as the iPhone flies through its
transitions and elements very well and
the Moto X continues to maintain its
very snappy experience in hardware it's
yet another similar story both phones
don't have expandable memory or
removable batteries battery life is very
good on the Moto X with its 22 hundred
million power unit while the iPhones 15
60 million power unit is capable of
lasting a whole day with the right
amount of usage while the 5s adds an a
fingerprint reader and it's home button
the Moto X also gets its own edition of
always-on voice recognition due to those
extra cores so on the one hand you can
unlock your phone using your thumbprint
while on the Moto X you can activate it
at any time by using just your voice for
the cameras both phones sport pretty
simple cameras with good capabilities
the X doesn't get a ton of features but
is easily accessible by flicking the
phone about some its app uses swipes to
navigate and makes it easy to get
pictures in a hurry the 5s got a very
welcomed revamped interface that adds
new modes like a square mode and slow
motion video capture we'll be taking a
closer look at the picture quality later
but I can tell you that the Moto X
doesn't quite capture super vibrant
pictures despite their great detail and
if the original iPhone 5 was any
indication the pictures out of the 5s
will remain very good on their own as
well
finally in software it's almost like a
pure OS shootout as the new iOS 7 takes
on the almost completely stock version
of Android in the Moto X despite a very
great makeover in iOS 7 the control
center updated multitasking and
notification drop-down are basically
layers over what is essentially the same
old iOS experience veterans will feel
right at home while enjoying the new
flat and translucent look stock Android
is often sought after by users and in
the Moto X it continues its functional
simplicity you get just what you need
with the home screens app drawers
notification drop-down and Google now
especially enhanced by the voice
commands if you want the pure experience
of either ecosystem Apple obviously has
just the iPhone while the Moto X stands
as one of the main ones available in
Android whether or not either one
provides exactly what you need is a
matter of experiencing them for
yourself and so there you have it's
about as close to comparison as we might
get with the iPhone and its Android
competitors you get a very classic
experience in either phone with a few
respective enhancements put in the good
thing is that both phones are actually
very accessible especially considering
their size and thus your choice might be
a little bit tougher overall but in the
end it's a decision that you're going to
have to make for all of the best
coverage keep it tuned to Android
thority your source for all things
