everybody enjoying a little bit of a
Haiti here I'm traveling right now I'm
down here in Shenzhen China where David
was as well
covering the Opel ar-15 event and right
before it I was in Shanghai covering the
Xiaomi me mix 2s which actually is my
daily driver and you can look forward to
the four of you coming pretty soon too
and Rathore decom one thing we want to
do today this is called the weekend show
and this is something that we wanted to
kind of put together just as a way of
being able to talk back with you guys in
the comment sections below if you've
noticed over the last number of videos
we've been asking you to comment and we
were going to respond to them either in
the comments section or in a later piece
of content you're watching it right now
I'm going to bring you some responses to
the comments that I had in a number of
videos that I did this past week but law
and also had a few pieces and we're
gonna make sure to get the other guys in
on future editions of the weekend show
ok so I just mentioned it a second ago
so why don't we go ahead and just look
at some comments some of the top
comments from the Xiaomi mimicks 2s
hands on I prefer this design more
compared to the notch one you know what
I'm kind of inclined to agree this full
screen experience is something that the
me mix originally kind of pioneered and
they did so by making some concessions
like the front-facing camera being on
the bottom now that might be a little
bit of an eyesore it might be a little
bit annoying to have to turn the phone
around so that you can do selfies or
even video call which is something I do
quite often but when it comes to looking
at the rest of the screen everything
above that little area it's just a
really fun device to use and the me mix
2's even though it's basically the same
device as the original one it's just an
iterative upgrade I have to admit I
really enjoy this DxO mark 97 whether or
not you really believe that the
excellent market review scores it's
really up to you it does provide a bit
of a benchmark early on just to kind of
give you a feel of what the phone would
be like in terms of the camera quality
but I have to say I do have a video
coming out slow with the 4k video on
here and as long as I put this on my DJI
Osmo mobile 2 because it doesn't really
have oh is built-in I have to admit the
footage that came out of it was pretty
awesome this was really interesting I
can't get the fact that this phone brand
gets noticed worldwide like how did it
happen exactly I heard about this brand
since 2017 that's just last year was
this brand already existed long ago the
only brains are heard of are Nokia
blackberry Samsung LG HTC and Apple and
then there's extra actually a little bit
of a history lesson Xiaomi has been
around for quite a while and they have
been in the business of software and if
you were into Android phones maybe about
10 years ago maybe you have flash roms
on old Android devices maybe you might
have come across the me UI the me UI was
originally Xiaomi's forward facing
software development team and that kind
of grew into everything that Jamie is
now they have phones they have
accessories they have this amazing
ecosystem of just so many different
products and the phones are really just
one part of the entire business but it
all started with the original me UI all
right
let's read some comments from the media
pad m5 and m5 Pro review shall we
no headphone jack on a tablet equals
fail I am oh I would have to agree with
you on that statement for sure and it
looks like quite a few people do as well
especially with the tablet called media
pad it's a tablet made for media
consumption and you would think that a
headphone jack would just come standard
because you're gonna want to listen to
music and whatever else but I will say
that the awesome sounding speakers on
those media pads you kind of make up for
it and at least they do give you an
adapter he's watching ninja 2:45 yes I
am watching ninja because ninja is
awesome and ninja is a god at fortnight
he's a god at any game that he plays
really but he's an awesome person on
Twitch and if you're not watching him
you definitely should or just buy a
Chromebook you know what I kind of have
to agree with that because Chromebooks
are pretty powerful they're definitely
much more powerful than Android tablets
and especially with Android apps being
able to be ran on Chromebooks it almost
doesn't make sense to buy an Android
tablet sometimes so
chromebooks you're gonna get a lot more
power and you're also going to get the
best of both worlds with Chrome OS and
Android who in their right mind would
choose an Android tablet Android may
make sense on smartphones but on tablets
it's dead go with iPad and I don't even
like Apple there's a lot of people out
there that still want a really solid
Android tablet and it's unfortunate
there are that there aren't that many
options to pick from the iPad is a
really solid tablet though it's probably
the best tablet you can get but some
people just want that Android OS on a
larger screen and it's just unfortunate
that there aren't more manufacturers
producing them right now but if you were
to get one the media pads really aren't
a bad choice at all can you delete the
pre-installed apps
I heard they take up a lot of space yes
you can delete most of the pre-installed
apps which is great because the media
pads come with a ton of bloat where they
come with a bunch of pre-installed games
but thankfully you can delete most of
them which is a good thing and then you
sort of have a pretty clean software
experience at that point is it true that
on this tablet you can't watch Netflix
and HD yes unfortunately that is true
right now there's some sort of DRM issue
that prevents it from playing TV shows
or movies on Netflix back in HD and
right now it sort of caps out at like
480p or something like that something
really low res but as far as everything
else like YouTube or any other source
that you may be watching movies or TV
shows from you should be perfectly fine
hopefully the Netflix thing will be
something that Huawei addresses sometime
very very soon well I think that's gonna
be it for me in this weekend segment I
will see you guys in the next one I do
want to talk a little bit about the
Huawei p20 Pro or rather the Huawei p20
and p20 Pro it's good that the notch is
optional no one can complain now about
it it's kind of an ingenious way of
doing it and really the notch doesn't
bother me a whole lot I don't like that
it's becoming so common which is why we
have phones like the Munich Stu
reminding us what the full screen
experience should be like or could be
like but honestly on the Huawei p20 the
notch is not that big of a deal for me
Wow 20 mega pixel monochrome 40
megapixel RGB 8 megapixel tele camera AI
to switch scenes and stabilized shots
inside a slim form factor we are in 2018
boys I completely agree and I think my
favorite part about that is that you
said it's a slim form factor there's
even a huge battery in there and while
we just kind of perfected their design
language s9 + the EXO mark 99p 20 pro DX
on work 109 or our IP Tier one brands in
2018 this is known as generation leap we
do seem to be hitting some sort of
stride in photography right now when it
comes to smartphone cameras and I
remember when I was really excited about
the evolution of the smartphone camera
it was back when the note 4 was coming
out and I revisited that phone F when
the next s device was coming out and
really I felt like our smartphone
cameras are just becoming incredible and
I feel like it's happening again
the software UI holds this phone back
technically you can say the same thing
about Samsung's you want Huawei
copy-pasted
the 10 I I'm thinking you mean the
iPhone 10 but the camera is so good and
you used an emoji though that's cool but
the camera is so good great rival for
the s9 and the all-mighty pixel XL - you
know what so what if people take the
same features that other people have
already introduced I mean that's kind of
the point of the smart phone game is
that some people innovate and then
everybody else just improves on what has
already existed so while we is doing a
great job and that first part is what I
mean but the second part of this comment
where its arrival to the s9 and the
pixel - I completely agree I can't wait
to put those through its paces Bravo -
Wow wafer surpassing Samsung Google and
Apple and the camera Department camera
matters much more than the iris scanner
face detection and other useless
gimmicks you know it's kind of funny you
say that because those other
quote-unquote useless gimmicks the
Huawei phone also kind of has if it has
a notch I'm not interested
and finally Twilight is so beautiful
anyone agree agree all right and that
should pretty much do it this is our
first time doing the weekend show and
thank you so much for watching yeah if
you want to have potentially your
comment answered in one of our weekly
shows then you can just go to our videos
and make sure you get into the comment
sections and tell us what you think
about that video the product that's
being presented maybe it's a comparison
and you want to pick a side do whatever
you wish in the comment sections down
below especially on this video and yeah
we'll be in the comment sections
responding and talking with you guys as
much as we possibly can keep it tuned to
andrew authority for that comparisons
more reviews and more no matter where we
are in the world like me for example in
Shenzhen China and remember that of
course we are your source for all things
Android is it delicious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
