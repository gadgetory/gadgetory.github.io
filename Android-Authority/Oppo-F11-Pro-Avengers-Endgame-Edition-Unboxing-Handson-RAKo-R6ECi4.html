Authority and Avengers endgame is in
theaters now and if you haven't seen it
you definitely should it's an amazing
film and to commemorate that film
OPO has released an Avengers end game
edition of the F 11 pro now we've
already reviewed this phone so if you
haven't seen that review and you want to
know more about it
we'll have that review linked for you in
a card above but let's get into it we're
gonna unbox the F 11 Pro Avengers
endgame Edition and show you what you
get with the phone and of course the
phone itself the first thing you're
gonna notice is that the end game
Edition box is a pretty standard black
box but it does have the Avengers logo
largely printed on the front and
Avengers end game on the sides of the
box once you open up the box the first
thing you are greeted with is this
collection certificate with a
commemorative Avengers and game gold
colored metal coin again you have the
Avengers logo on the front and then on
the back of the coin you have Avengers
end game only in theaters the next thing
you get is the phone itself inside of a
plastic sleeve that lists a few of the
specs on the front but we're gonna set
this off to the side for just a second
and see what else you get the next
interesting item that you get with the
end game edition is a case this is a
soft touch faux leather light case with
a Captain America shield on the backside
and the outer ring of the shield can be
lifted outwards to be used as a
kickstand or you can slide your finger
through it to make it a lot harder to
drop your phone inside of the case is a
soft touch material so that your phone
doesn't get scratched up and it also has
the Avengers logo printed on it not
gonna lie it's a pretty sweet-looking
case everything else that comes with the
phone is pretty standard stuff and a
little less exciting
you of course have your reading
materials a micro USB cable with support
for vogue fast charging a pair of
included earbuds which is kind of nice
and finally the charging brick now it's
time for what you've all came here for
and it's the phone itself I gotta admit
it looks pretty freakin amazing it is
Captain America theme just like the case
so the back glass is blue with a
hexagonal pattern etched into the glass
and a red Avengers logo there's also a
smaller Avengers logo printed on the
housing of the camera module the power
button is read to further accentuate the
Captain America red and blue theme and
if you look closely there's a small
Marvel logo printed in the bottom left
side of the frame there is a Marvel
Avengers theme that comes pre-installed
with the software but all it changes is
your home screen and lockscreen
wallpaper otherwise it's the same exact
software as any other f11 pro so that's
it for this quick unboxing slash
hands-on or first impressions of the
Oppo f1 progeny Madision let us know
what you guys think of it down in the
comments below and please don't spoil
the end game thanks for watching and
I'll talk to you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
