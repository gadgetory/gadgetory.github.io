Darla cuvee we're taking a first look at
the Galaxy Note 10.1 now this is a
device that generated a lot of
excitement when it was launched at
Mobile World Congress in Barcelona last
February it was delayed for reasons we
won't detail now let's just say it has
something to do with Apple either way
what we're looking at today before us is
one of the most powerful if not the most
powerful Android tablet on the market it
features a 10.1 inch display with a
resolution of 1280 by 800 now Samsung
received a little bit of criticism in
fact a lot from the hardcore evangelist
and us included for not including a
high-res display like the one they made
for Apple with the iPad 3 they're more
than capable of doing it and it appears
to be a cost-cutting attempt on their
part internally though what we're
looking at is a 1.4 gigahertz quad core
Exynos processor which is incredibly
powerful and the same one that's
featured in the samsung galaxy s3 and
the galaxy note 2 otherwise we have 30
DQ gigabytes of memory inside 2
megapixel camera on the front with a 5
megapixel camera on the rear up top we
have an infrared sensor with a microSD
slot obviously a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack we have some headphone
buttons and a power Samsung made an
intelligent move in terms of the design
by putting the speaker grilles on the
front how many tablets have come across
our desks that has speakers on the rear
that were muffled when people hold them
in the way that they have to hold
tablets so it's nice to see they finally
improved in that area otherwise we're
looking at s notes right here and that's
notes it's kind of cool because we have
the ability for multi-pane utility so we
can watch a movie we can check out
Polaris Office a gallery or we can use
the Internet particularly for those that
are maybe webmasters or otherwise
graphic designers or dealing with large
amounts of data and who need to make
access and notes to spreadsheets and
whatnot it does appear that this would
be great with the Esper antennas
functionality in s note itself we're
able to export notes to PDF and also out
to JPEG
all right how do we want to export it
out so quite convenient that's nice to
have you know and typically if I was to
use something like this I would have to
send it as an email attachment then I
have to use Photoshop on my computer so
for creative types and for others who
are dealing with a lot of visual and
textual and quantitative data this would
be a device that could benefit them
greatly
Samsung included a whole bunch of other
stuff which we're not going to get into
typically we're not really fans of
manufacturer overlays they slow down the
device they try and all they try and
augment Android but typically they
actually slow down and if you think the
performance of this device is fast if
you actually remove some of the widgets
and that Samsung has included you will
know that it actually gets a lot faster
either way it is still one of the most
powerful devices on the market I mean 3d
gaming it really really has great smooth
operation otherwise it has embedded GPS
and Wi-Fi and Bluetooth the GPS is very
very accurate we were able to get a
signal of more than 20 feet within our
approximate distance which is great it
does also work without Wi-Fi the S Pen
is obviously created in partnership with
welcome one of the leaders in the
digital stylus space that Samsung has
been collaborating with for over two
years
it does claim that there is over 1,000
levels of pressure sensitivity although
it does seem like there's more like five
so let's try to make a new note here is
to show you a few things okay so we can
incorporate a lot of different stuff it
is quite responsive actually we're here
with Android Authority obviously
something that I'm not really into I'd
be more about changing and copying over
images and if I find something that cool
little thumbnail something I would be
interested in including that so for me
the S Pen doesn't really bring the
greatest amount of Attraction otherwise
we have a pls eye pls LCD which is known
for its incredible brightness and low
cost to manufacture for Samsung other
than that the device itself the build
quality is questionable
it does creaking grown under bending the
back does have quite a bit of flex to it
in terms of the aesthetic it is very
similar on to the horizontal edging
featured on the galaxy s3 and galaxy No
- that is the flex makes me question it
we have a proprietary port on the rear
on a microphone slot and this is where
our S Pen slides into if I can get it in
there properly otherwise the Wi-Fi is
very very good to connect the speakers
are very very loud
it is very routing friendly as we know
Samsung devices are very very easy to
route the cameras I did a Skype HD with
a family member it was alright the rear
camera is questionable but no one really
likes to take pictures with their tablet
anyway yeah other than that our first
impressions have been very positive a
nice fluid operation from this device a
demanding app which is over screen it's
very very fluid and you'll see that it
loads quite quickly as well basically
this is an independent third-party app
that offers you the ability to do a lot
of different stuff we can have multiple
windows open at the same time so if I
want to have YouTube going and then
perhaps my email if I can even there we
are quite fluid also - we should know
that Samsung did opt to include three
keyboards in this one this is the
floating keyboard which doesn't really
float but that's why they call it do we
have our standard QWERTY keyboard so
it's good to see that Samsung really is
trying otherwise yeah we were generally
quite pleased with it it would be better
if Samsung could lower the price but
overall the performance and despite the
resolution display this it's still quite
excellent so let us know what you think
of the Galaxy Note 10.1 if you think
it's a tablet worth $4.99 for a 16
gigabyte and what you'd like to see from
Samsung in their next high-end tablet my
name is Darcy Locke cuvee we're here
from Android authority thank you for
checking out our review and let us know
what you think of our channel on our
videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
