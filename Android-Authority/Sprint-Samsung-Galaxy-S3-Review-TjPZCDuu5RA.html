young we're coming at you from the
number one website for all things
Android Android authority comm today
we're gonna be giving you an in-depth
review and a close look at the Samsung
Galaxy s3 for Sprint we've got the white
model before we get into any of the
software or hardware more-or-less let's
just take a look at how this phone fits
in the hand see here that we've got our
power button on the right
embedded in our chrome accents we've got
our volume rocker here on the left also
in our chrome accents on the back we've
got our Sprint carrier branding as well
as our Samsung Galaxy s3 logo here's our
LED our speaker and then our eight
megapixel rear facing camera got a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack right here on
the top as well as a small microphone
here's our earpiece we've got two
sensors and a 1.9 megapixel front-facing
camera as well as our LED there got our
physical home button with some nice
chrome accents around there or microUSB
which is plugged in right now and then
also another small microphone this is a
four point eight inch Corning Gorilla
Glass 2 screen here so it's a pretty
scratch resistant ding resistant and
it's beautiful we've got a Super AMOLED
display at 1280 by 720 p the pixel
density of 306 pixels per inch now
anyways let's just go into the main
front screen of this phone when we pop
on the lock screen we can see here we've
got a few quick icons down there
including our phone our messaging our
smart memo and then our camera
application we've got a nice clock there
I've got some charging notifications
here and then our status bar is pulled
down a bowl if that's a word when we
have our lock screen open also we can
just swipe to unlock nice fluid motion
there right here we greeted with our
main home screen where we've got some
pre-loaded widgets from Sprint as well
as from Samsung themselves here's our
sprint pre-loaded widgets something call
it below where this is the sprint
hotspot we've got a sprint zone and
we've got our voicemail services there
as we scroll through we see we have
infinite scrolling across all of the
home screens where you can technically
just go from left to right all the way
infinitely here we've got our s suggest
which is a native Samsung application or
media
the Samsung music player and then our
home screen here with a nice weather
widget let's go into our app drawer we
see we've got apps and widgets as well
as our downloaded tab there go back to
all of those we've got our AllShare Play
preloaded some chat on we've got
downloads manager a Flipboard
application Dropbox of course we've got
50 free gigabytes of storage on there
for two years when you buy it from
Sprint of course all of our Google Apps
such as Gmail Google Plus we've got
Samsung media home and Samsung key is
also our sprint apps this comes
pre-loaded with Google Wallet
I've got YouTube we've got our music
player s suggest s voice the native
Samsung Apps that make the Samsung
Galaxy s3 stand out and we got our
widgets as well which I feature some
dual clocks contact wedge 'it's Collin
calendar tasks more clock widgets we've
got our assistive lite calendar of
course we also have infinite scrolling
on the widgets in the apps s suggest go
through here music playlist S Memo as
bookmarks and all of those are the
native Samsung features that are audio
options here Google+ posts go through
now how these actually work is you'll
grab a widget and then we can move over
to the right or left to an empty home
screen we can set it there but if we're
holding an app we can bring it down and
create folder or create page or we can
also get the app info but we'll set that
there I haven't set up an account but as
you can see the resizable up and down
and left and right as well makes that
really convenient allows you to have a
nice room on your home screen in case
you need more anyways we can pull down
our notification bar up here where you
see some toggles we do have a system
update available at this point which
will add the brightness slider and a few
other things including a power menu icon
and a bunch of stuff like that but
anyways here is our toggles here we've
got our Wi-Fi Bluetooth GPS sound screen
rotation bunch of power saving features
airplane mode sync this is where we
access our full settings menu we've got
Wi-Fi Bluetooth data usage more settings
and under the more settings is where we
can enable VPN NFC which is a near field
communication
as well as Android Beam you can
communicate send apps pictures messages
or web pages via back-to-back Android
smartphones that are Android Beam
enabled we can enable sbeam which is
basically the same thing we'll go back
here got our Daisy data usage settings
sound display wallpaper will go into our
display this is what we're gonna have to
choose our brightness we can choose
automatic brightness or actually set a
set brightness got our smart stay
feature which actually watches your eyes
as you can see and whenever you're not
looking at the screen it will attempt to
dim the screen or shut it off completely
as to save your battery we have our font
style and font size we'll go ahead and
switch up the font just to show you guys
will choose the Helvetica s and you know
of our settings and everything is in
that or entire system is in that font
anyways we've got our power saver
features storage battery and application
manager also got accounts in sync
location services and security down to
the Security tab we can choose our
different screen lock options as well as
lock screen options where you can choose
an information ticker to show us the
news camera quick access as well of
course we have clock when we can choose
our weather as well we can disable the
ripple effect and then of course during
the screen lock we can set whether or
not we want motion face swipe on lock
face end voice or a pin anyways we can
choose to install unknown sources which
I always do and choose device
administrators we can go down to our
dock date and time accessibility we've
got our developer options that come
native with Ice Cream Sandwich or we can
enable USB debugging and we can also go
down and enable force GPU rendering for
2d hardware acceleration now we can go
down to our about device where we can
see that we were running Android 4.0.4
and we do have our easter egg on here
and we've already seen custom roms with
jelly beans so I wouldn't be too worried
about that we should be getting it very
soon we've got a kernel version here our
build is May 23rd and we have our
hardware version status of the phone and
all that so anyways let's just check out
some of the modifications we made to the
lockscreen we'll go ahead and shut it
off pop her back on
here we go and as you can see now we do
have our news ticker and our news ticker
will scroll all in like that and we can
see all of our different news stories we
chose we can change it to technology
science a bunch of different stuff top
stories and we can also bring it up so
when we bring it up we can scroll
through select a story and go to it we
do have our weather set by location as
well as our charging and then we have
our quick controls for camera and all
those things so let's actually use one
of these quick controls and check out
the camera when we're in the camera we
have a bunch of different settings we're
not able to use the flash because the
battery is low big deal anyways we can
tap and hold the icon and drag it to
edit the position of the shortcuts which
is awesome it's a lot of cool menus that
tell you a lot of stuff about the
Samsung Galaxy s3 but let's pop a
picture as you can see it - it can take
them pretty fast just by tapping pennies
we'll go ahead and check out our
settings and then our settings we can
choose the Edit shortcuts self portrait
mode shooting mode single shots we can
do burst shot HDR smile shot Beauty
panorama cartoon share shot which
instantly uploads them and buddy photo
share we have our scene mode where you
can choose portrait landscape night a
bunch of different cool stuff we've got
our exposure value focus mode timer
effects you can choose our resolution
here we always want a resolution to be
the highest possible 8 megapixels there
we've got our white balance our ISO are
metering anti-shake Auto contrast
there's a bunch of different settings
for this here's our focus settings we
have macro face detection auto focus and
then we can use our front-facing camera
what's going on this is a 1.9 megapixel
front-facing camera by the way so this
is just a really great camera you guys
we can also do the video camera and
during the video camera we can adjust
our focus just by tapping the screen
stuff like that very cool check out some
of the other apps such as the browser
now so it's going to sign in on my
Google account if you logged in on a
Google account beware it will sign in
with your Google account you might want
to sign out before you browse go ahead
and click back so it doesn't do that
we're gonna go to our sprint power deck
it looks like now to change the
brightness on our website
i'ts we will go to brightness and colors
we will deselect automatic brightness
and click OK anyways while this is just
loading we can show you some of the
options here we can share the page new
window of course add bookmark desktop
view which is awesome because I always
like that the supports Flash and we're
going to see some html5 integration as
well it supports that we can go to our
browser settings where we have our labs
where you can enable our quick shortcuts
our quick controls and stuff like that
as well as full-screen browsing ways
this is our tab manager if we add some
more like this we can do that once again
and even and we can scroll through just
like that
to delete a tab we simply press a little
minus key up there and we can add
incognito windows so it doesn't track
our browsing and search history this is
our refresh button here is our bookmarks
it loads them from your Google account
our history and our saved pages that's
very cool we'll go back anyways let's
check out a few of our other Samsung
applications on here such as the S Memo
the S Memo is pretty cool it's nothing
like the lg optimus where you can kind
of access at any moment this is this
more of like a drawing application we a
lot of check this one out this is in the
View mode we can also edit the pictures
add some stuff on there some cool stuff
like that and anyways we can go back we
can choose our recent applications by
pressing and holding the home button
where we can slide to remove them or
easily access them by simply clicking
now we can remove all just like that and
then also enter our task manager by
clicking there on our task manager we
can see which applications are running
it looks like there's none we have a
list of our downloaded applications and
then we have our RAM where we have one
point 6 gigabytes clear which is fairly
good now with 2 gigabytes of RAM and
have no problem at all running as many
applications as you heart desires so
