time with loved ones family is also good
too so we're going to we're gonna keep

bore you into oblivion just do a quick
what hot topic quick recap what's uh
what's on our mind this week from the
Android world and we'll let you go here
in about Oh fifteen twenty minutes yeah
it seems like the majority of the people
are kind of you know getting a little
bit of a Christmas hangover and they're
going slowly and getting ready for new
years yeah see by the time you're doing
your christmas hangover you ready for
your new year's hangover right exactly
you got some big plans uh well i'm at
the hum at the ripe age where I'm
married I have kids and I really don't
get to go out for New Year's because I
have a three-year-old and one-year-old
so I'll be partying at home um like you
always do like I always do yeah you know
might might go up to a family party for
a little bit but have to come home early
with the kids and then once they go to
bed that's time for Derek to party you
know party by himself yeah alright I'm
excited oh but Parenthood's great trust
me I love my kids um how about you Scott
any big big New Year's plans I'm doing
some more stuff family um I don't get to
see him that often anymore um but yeah
spent Christmas with them how'd your
Christmas go as Christmas you know I
mean it does good you know families in
from various locations around the
country actually not too many various
locations on a few but uh yeah I had the
worst christmas and i will get onto that
uh a little bit more depth it was
actually post christmas um you had a bad
post-christmas okay it was horrible
uh yeah get in bed uh is this where
there's a death of not one but two
android devices and we might get into it
I might do a little bit of a demo what's
going on Oh basically it's unfortunate
and no one likes to hear when an android
device dies know when when one of your
fellow android goes down your cat is
huge by the way you know what every time
we have a show i have to block her out
of the room where she does this night i
had her blocked out before the show
started somehow she she's a cat you know
she snuck her way through that gate and
oh well she'll provide sidebar
entertainment over here in the corner
all right so uh enough BS and let's uh
so we're gonna talk about real quick and
talk about some google play apps
some-some a few things with music
there's some google TV updates and new
devices a little bit of news from
verizon and an android jelly bean update
that was there and then was not nexus 10
stuffs and Galaxy Note rumors and that's
an even more rumors we're gonna talk
about some google motorola phone rumors
and what you can do to if you want to be
a developer so all right let's let's
let's get started here and talk a little
bit about yeah it's the end he is when
everybody produces list of best whatever
2012 worst whatever in 2012 you know
bulova best worst you name it every
everything has a category everything has
a list so Google Play has a list and
google's official list that they met
they released up today and let's want to
talk about some of the apps and put on
there um you know that they're talking
about zappos mint series guide show
manager Pixlr Express TED conferences
Evernote ever know it's really good app
i actually have all those i just
mentioned that well meant i've used to
but ever notes are really nice app a
grim snow white expedia fancy and trusty
ancestry pocket as in the newsreader
very popular news reader and pinterest
is all pictures actually i don't use
pinterest but it's a very nicely
designed app so um yeah i mean those are
all very well does
i napped I would have assumed some other
ones would have been on there but yeah
there will designed but um I mean
personally I use two of those pretty
much every day I use mint every day and
I use a series guide show manager when i
get home and wanna watch TV on Scott I
don't know about series God chill
manager really nice what does that mean
it's something for TV right um yeah it's
basically kind of a archive of what
you've watched and on keep an archive of
that and a list of your history of what
you've watched so you don't watch it
again and you know what episodes you've
missed it's kind of nice you can check
them off by episode or you can say I've
seton the whole season so you don't have
to check every single one it's actually
quite it's quite nice now let me since
I'm a big google TV fan I that would be
pretty awesome if that was available for
Google TV now some of the some of the
functionality very very similar almost
reminds me of prime time in a prime time
you can rate it you know you can rate
chose and you can find shows and so
forth it's a prime times of Google TV
movie a search app you know I use it
every day when I want to watch TV cuz I
don't know any of my shown channel
numbers you know sidisport prime time it
shows me what's playing yeah and it
would be nice if that integrated with
Google TV because like let's say a show
was on that you haven't seen before it's
about to start in an hour BAM you know
Google Google now me and warn me yeah
very cool s'alright so now know what
series God is uh I may have to check
that out um now if you know like Scott
and I said some of these apps well we
were surprised to see them on the list
I'm sure you might be as well so we're
actually doing a little a preview here
ourselves an android authority actually
crowdsource to google+ asking our users
our fans our followers what you know
they feel should be on the 2012 app list
and i'll be actually offering that
article here whenever i get off my lazy
butt here in a few days before the end
of the year trust me alright so a speedo
Google Play let's talk about Google
playing music the new scan and match is
a has a few people fired up apparently
the new scan and match
will scan your song and match the
existing content and if it's an explicit
lyrics version of the song people are
reporting back that some of their songs
are now the radio edit version the clean
version um it seems it's only happening
for like popular like you know singles
whereas I would say a whole album has
you know a bunch of swear words in it
every single track but only two songs on
the album or are popular and actually
have radio edit versions which those yet
so those radio edit versions are getting
thrown in the mix instead so that sucks
I mean there's only ready to put it yeah
it sucks but there's there's a simple
fix for you just find the song you say
fix incorrect match and a little bit
extra work but you know it's a new
service it's a growing pain I'm now I'm
you gotta remember we can store 20,000
songs for free so you can't really
complain too much it's a free service
you know I'm the rolling out do a lot of
people in the US yeah yeah so I mean
it's gonna get better yeah i'm sure it
uh but it's free you really shouldn't
complain a whole lot about you know a
free service all those it when you
realize that all your naughty lyrics are
gone you know what maybe should listen
to that naughty music that angry music
Scott you know um well you know what you
gotta have that naughty moment in your
life were you listening at 90 music
loves up some naughty music alright um
so hisense release their Google Play I'm
sorry their Google TV device we're just
talking with Google Play so high since
released the google TV device it's a $99
set-top box we did a review on it i'm
not going to go into it a whole lot
because actually tomorrow night if you
watch or listen to us tomorrow night
myself and a bunch of other hisense
pulse owners are going to be doing a
dedicated hangout on air to just the
Hisense balls because we could talk
about the Hisense pulse all night long
are there fairly new company I know
they've been around force and I looked
wicked PT and I'm gonna say since the
60s and what have they been doing well
the world or a Chinese company um so so
they're they're you know they're there
an emerging electronics company over
here in the US and we haven't heard a
lot from them but you know they're there
a fairly popular company in China contra
oh yeah so
tune in tomorrow night at eight thirty
p.m. eastern time and we're going to go
over a we're gonna have a show dedicated
towards just the high sense of also i'm
not gonna get really into it here now
but it's a great it's a great little
google TV box i love it a lot cool so
the verizon droid razr the original in
the original droid razr maxx on business
e the OG on christmas eve got a jelly
bean update which was great because you
know it's a motorola device and it's on
verizon and this you know never happens
so they got it they got an update
everybody can seriously so if you're
watching a listing right if you're
listening right now Mike a to keep
jumping up my lap it's really annoying
it's disrupting the show I wonder how
they're pushing it out like that um how
old does that device it's a year old
yeah yeah yeah so but the interesting
thing about the update is so people got
the update the first night capulin and
then somebody to wait a second wait a
second we shouldn't put that out there
in the yang we could have done more
testing yeah so and and I'm assuming it
was yanked because not because they
didn't want to push it out because it
wasn't ready no not because of
bureaucratic you know you know
information that needed to be pushed
forward paperwork or anything i think
was actually pushed out because it
wasn't ready as in it wasn't completely
stable shaking your head no Scott nope I
believe it was a Christmas Eve right
yeah if I hear that it's King jellybean
why do I not go out and buy that device
because huh no not that see I don't know
I heard reports today I understand what
you're saying yeah I heard reports today
that that verizon has put out a
statement saying if you receive the
jelly bean update in your phone is now
running my crap give it back to us how
come into the store will hook you up
with it with a new Ice Cream Sandwich
version you so you so that makes me
believe they pushed out the update too
early and it wasn't ready some people
with the phones running like crap so
they're just gonna say hey we'll give
you a new phone and we'll push out the
update when we're ready
and that's cool if that's what they're
doing but it it's kind of a big blunder
to push it out if it wasn't ready you
know what I mean damn agree oh let's see
so Nexus 10 may or may not have an
accessory they sold like 50 or 60 of
these pogo pin charges on ebay like it
showed up on eBay you know there's no
official word from Samsung there's no
official word from google but apparently
somebody over in South Korea made mag
nectar or the magnet connector pogo pin
chargers which supposedly charge the
device uh twenty-five percent faster
then standard USB and uses the magnet
you know and they're they're gone now at
least they were yesterday haven't look
today but they sold very very fast there
they're authentic mean that they're real
are they official I don't know it you
know I mean if they're made by a company
called magnetic or so I don't know if
Samsung's / google is eventually going
to use these as official connectors or
if another company just went out and
made them because they weren't available
yet so no one really knows but there are
20 bucks on ebay i'm sure people be
getting them here in the near very near
future and will gue will start seeing
reviews on them and everything yeah I'm
mom I like offend his feet it's nice all
right so uh we had some rumors let's
talk about some rumors as past week we
had a galaxy note 7 tablet was was
spotted in a benchmark now we're we're
assuming that's that's what it's called
you know it we know of the model number
and we assume that's what it is it was
soon as what's going to look like so
what what this is is it's a 7-inch note
27 inch tablet and we have the original
notes a 5-inch screen we have the 5.5
inch note 2 we have the 10.1 note full
tablet and now we're going to try for
that sweet spot the 7 inch tablet so
which which kind of makes me curious if
you already have a note to which is five
and a half inch screen do you need a 7
inch screen nuts and you know it's not
not much different not when you're like
why not yeah you know when Samsung has
the money in the
android smartphone success and tablet
success to pretty much do whatever the
hell they want they can put out as many
different device configurations and see
which one people bite on your gets
murdered exactly i mean they sold 10
million original notes so that's awesome
yeah and the note 2 is doing just as
well in the galaxy s3's don't even
better you have there there the other
blanket the market doing anything that
anything and everything and whatever
consumers want buh-bye you know it
doesn't really matter it doesn't really
phase them so continue on with rumors
Scott I like this rumor I do to Google
and Motorola are working on X phone and
X tablet according to The Wall Street
Journal so what does this mean for the
Nexus line well Nexus has an X in it
does that mean anything who knows
speculate away um according to The Wall
Street Journal the phone will not be
replacing the current droid line but
it'll be a different product a different
product altogether so we still might see
you know droid phones and we might see
this new X zone you know whatever will
be a nexus with a capital X that's not
open for I'm hoping that's what it is I
I could use a new Nexus um supposedly
it's gonna happen well we're gonna say
it has google motorola have explored
bendable screens and ceramic materials
that would make the device is more
durable that doesn't mean it's going to
have them as knew they were looking into
it i'm also image and gesture
recognition software is most likely
going to be integrated into the devices
as well but this is all speculation you
know Wall Street Journal just had a few
tidbits information so all I can say is
fingers crossed confidence hi these
devices will be amazing yes I'm really
excited about this um unfortunately I
don't really think it's going to come as
soon as we want just like every other
Android device you know it doesn't come
as soon as we want and hopefully it does
but
kind of on the fence about if this is
going to come out soon or no really yes
Damon hard cats do what they want to uh
anyway so yeah I'm excited for it um
last little bit of information you want
to talk about thought things pretty cool
we have a lot of people that watch the
show with a lot of people that were
friends with that want to be
android-developers either rom developers
or kernel developers maybe they're
working on a rom called in it t you know
it doesn't really matter what they're
working on they want to be an Android
developer so the awesome people over at
XDA developers came up with XD a
university um it covers various things
such as how to get started with get you
get the version control system everybody
uses you know just github you don't have
to use github but but it is very popular
how to build a colonel from source learn
how an actual rom is built and built a
rom you can get started with building
Android itself from source how to port
clockworkmod to your device and porting
AOSP roms using source code so and more
will be added and so forth but this is
great for anybody looking you know to
start to tinker into Android a little
bit and want to do a little bit more
want to see what development is all
about so they have a bunch of guides and
almost like a wiki style is it right now
this information is most likely
available on XDA but when the forum is
is heavily hammered and visited and
posted on been around as long as XDA
sometimes it's kind of hard to find that
useful information it gets buried under
new content because everybody's they're
constantly posting and adding and
updating so XD a university is here to
try to try to make it easier I think
that's great i'm going to actually check
out some of the some of the articles
here hopefully it will help me and dan
work on the droid DNA team at Colonel
that we've been working on together so
it'd be nice to just get some more
information how about how about you
Scott you gonna go to XDA University and
be a big bad wrong developer I mean it
sounds interesting i'm always you know
looking to learn stuff and i definitely
be interested to learn and that seems
like an okay avenue um hopefully i mean
i was thinking doing books but uh yeah
it's definitely collaboration is a lot
better all right well I said since it's
the holiday season working to keep
everybody around a whole lot this
evening and doing a bridge show since
cotton I can do holiday things as well
um that's it for the news portion but
but I think Scott has a little little
Christmas sadness for us I didn't hear
this whole story it but first of all um
I want to know what you guys got for
Christmas um any Android device comment
um want to know what you got and if you
didn't get anything I want to know what
you got other people that was and Erick
related how did you spread or see the
Android love i think is what you're
saying yeah personally i gave away a
whole bunch of little android doohickeys
to all the people all my relatives that
own android phones and made the iphone
people feel bad once an Android
doohickey cuz that could be anything I
mean literally was anything LA woman
this guy right here's an Android
doohickey I yeah you got y'all went to
nice all right so so let's let's hear
this story let me find out about how you
shed android tears okay well um I was ok
so I have two devices right now true
phones um I do have a nexus 7 but that
one's intact think so within Nexus 4
which I got on the 15th so I have three
days until the 15 day after it than a to
call a customer support um basically
what happened is walking along pulled it
out of you know up hands that's not
dirty um somebody was looking no um
pulled it out and it just dropped and
Michael I it is a slippery
phone especially the back and not making
excuses for why I dropped it but it
sucked and I'll show you guys what it
looks like that's a little spider okay
yeah it still works but touch screen
don't work so that's a bummer and then
that happened on Christmas night and
then that morning post christmas I woke
up you know to shower just about to go
to work it's um driving around get some
errands before work and then I dropped
another phone he dropped the old galaxy
I dropped the other phone and this one
has a screen protector so oh god I
almost drop it again um so this one
works just fine so what are you gonna do
well bought that my nexus 4 you know off
contract and it's been less than 15 days
since I got it so I'm gonna call
customer support and plead to I'm
probably just gonna get the screen
replaced I just don't know how much
that's going to be um I mean what would
you guys do without your in my position
I have the Galaxy Nexus that I could
revive cuz i love that phone and nexus 4
don't know i don't know i'm curious to
see how that pans out for you see what
the the Play Store support says I don't
think I've ever done like a return in my
life i did a return on my Nexus 7 when
it it died they what was that on the
Thanksgiving yeah thanksgiving it died
but um day I mean I had new one
two days but I didn't yeah but that was
like it was it was the heart was a
hardware DJ wasn't human air yeah it
wasn't I'm not laughing because uh it's
funny I'm laughing because I'm a jerk
like I I really feel sorry for you oh no
I I cried for about four hours and then
I started laughing so that's normal
right I'm so what let's see what people
got for Christmas power bag sugar vas
brothers God Nexus 7 I saw one family at
one low one on one guy Google+ posted
his family Christmas presents he posted
4 Nexus 7's in a Galaxy Nexus and a
nexus 4 oh man he said he got all his
kids uh that's so cool as is very cool
uh Kenneth Sam to put coal on that nexus
4 no he didn't he tied some coal to it
