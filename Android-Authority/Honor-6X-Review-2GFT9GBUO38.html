authority and this is the honor 6x this
is the latest affordable mid-range
smartphone from Huawei zhannar line and
it's the successor to last year's honor
5x for better or worse it shares some
similarities to the 5x but they've made
quite a few hardware improvements and
refined the design to make this phone in
even better bargain it still retains the
composite metal design from last year
which means there is metal on this phone
but it's not entirely wrapped in metal
nor is a unibody design the back plate
is made of metal which is surrounded by
plastic windows on the top and bottom to
help with antenna reception and because
the metal doesn't wrap around to the
front you'll find a plastic frame that
goes around the outer edges of the glass
instead it doesn't feel quite as high
quality or premium as a fully unibody
metal smartphone but the build quality
is still pretty top-notch and there
isn't much you can really complain about
considering the phone's price Huawei has
also given the honor 6x a much curvier
design the back side tapers down along
the edges and the corners have been
rounded off to allow this phone to sit
much more comfortably in the hand the
buttons and ports are all in pretty
typical locations the left side houses
the power and volume keys and they're
both pretty easy to reach but they
aren't very tactile and don't provide a
very satisfying click it does indeed
have a headphone jack which lives up top
and on the right side is the SIM card
tray that supports dual SIM or a micro
SD card in the second slim slot if you'd
rather have that expandable storage on
the bottom is a microUSB port so there's
no USB type-c here which is kind of
unfortunate considering how many phones
may delete two USB type-c this year but
if you haven't transitioned a USB C yet
then this may not be that big of an
issue flanking the microUSB port are two
speaker grilles with one being a
microphone and the other being the
actual speaker itself like all single
bottom firing speakers it's very easy to
muffle with your hand when using the
phone in landscape and actually found
the speaker to be a lot quieter than
most other phones that I've used with
single speakers the other unfortunate
part about honor 6x aside from the weak
speaker is the lack of NFC this means no
tap to transfer or using mobile payment
services like Android pay so if you use
those type of services on your smart
phone you're simply out of luck with the
6x around the back is the fingerprint
sensor sitting right below the camera
and in my experience the fingerprint
sensor has been great it's
very accurate and fast to unlock and I
rarely ran into issues with it miss
reading my fingerprint I would even go
as far as saying that it's just as good
as a lot of other fingerprint sensors
found on flagship smartphones the
fingerprint sensor can also be used to
take photos or videos answer phone calls
stop alarms and bring down the
notification shade by swiping down or
browse through photos in your gallery by
swiping left to right what you're all
pretty helpful and making this phone
easy to use in one hand switch into the
front of the phone you've got a 5.5 inch
LCD display with 1080p resolution and
overall it's a fine display it's plenty
sharp and gets bright enough to
comfortably see outdoors but the colors
are pretty washed out which is my only
real gripe with this screen it's still
perfectly usable and the large size
still provides for a good experience
with browsing the web playing games or
watching YouTube and considering this is
a rather inexpensive smartphone the
flaws on this display are much more
easily forgivable powering on or 6 X is
3 gigabytes of RAM with Wobblies own
in-house chip the akhirin 655 it's a
pretty significant upgrade over last
year's 5x both in terms of RAM and
processor and performance is plenty good
for a mid-range phone it's fluid and
responsive in regular reviews and has no
problems running graphically demanding
games with smooth frame rates I would
say performance is probably one of its
biggest strengths especially when you
consider the price to performance ratio
another strong point for the honor 6x is
battery life it's a very respectable
size at 3340 milliamp hours and it's
even bigger than some batteries we've
seen in current 2016 flagships
while we claims that the honor 6x can
last a little over two days with regular
usage and one and a half days with heavy
usage which is a really bold claim and
while I never hit the 2 day mark with
this phone I did get one and a half days
pretty consistently or at least close to
it I do play a lot of games and watch a
fair amount of YouTube on my phone which
does qualify as heavy usage so it does
look like the honor 6 X's battery life
is living up to its promise and a
phone's battery life living up to a
manufacturer's claim isn't something you
can say for very many smartphones so I
have to say I've been pretty impressed
with this phone's battery life it sips
very little power when on standby which
has a lot to do with Karen 6:55
efficiency but even with constant use
this phone can still last a long time I
would usually end the day with at least
50% battery life left it was a pretty
nice feeling to only have to recharge
this phone every other day instead of
everyday even if I did charge this phone
every night I was always comfortably
making it through the entire day
and never found myself frantically
searching for a charger we've seen a lot
of phones come out within the last year
with dual cameras but we get to see a
dual camera setup on a more affordable
smartphone until now and while we claims
that the honor 6x is the first dual
camera smartphone in its price bracket
every dual camera smartphone uses a
second camera a little bit differently
and in the case of the honor 6x you have
a 12 megapixel primary camera and a 2
megapixel secondary sensor the 2
megapixel sensor is used purely for
capturing depth information which can be
taken advantage of when using the
cameras wide aperture mode the wide
aperture mode lets you dial in the
aperture from f-16 down to us wide as F
point 9 v for a very large bokeh effect
while changing the quote unquote
aperture does give you more or less
depth of field it doesn't allow for more
light to enter the camera so it's not a
true aperture change in that sense of
the word but the bokeh effect does work
quite well and looks very convincing
you're also not tied to the original
settings and focus point and can change
these after the fact to any image taken
in this mode but for best results it's
better to keep the focus point on
subjects in the foreground as switching
the focus point to subjects in the
background can make the bokeh effect
looked a little artificial the rest of
the camera app is pretty easy to
navigate swiping to the left takes you
to the general camera settings and
swiping to the right will give you
access to a good selection of different
shooting modes including a beauty mode
night shot manual mode and a mode for
scanning documents the overall camera
experience has been quite impressive
it's fast to focus and capture photos
and the photos are surprisingly very
pleasant especially for a mid-range
phone the photos have great color are
well detailed and does a great job with
balancing highlights and shadows which I
didn't expect on a phone of this caliber
it also performs fairly well in low
light highlights are mostly kept in
check with only a few rare occasions
where they would appear overly blooming
or overexposed it's only in the worst of
low-light situations that the camera
completely fall apart but most low-light
shots are perfectly usable with a fair
amount of detail and noise being kept to
a minimum with the software you're
looking at walkways usually emotion UI
skin that currently sits on top of
android 6.0 marshmallow although in
update 2 nuga is supposedly coming soon
it's very bright colourful somewhat
cartoonish and everything else that
you'd normally expect from emotion UI
like transparency effects and the lack
of an app drawer the notification panel
is still split into two tabs with one
for notifications and the other for
toggles which doesn't feel as easy to
use as stock Android and when you have
long list of notifications it becomes
nearly impossible to swipe over to the
quick toggles panel without accidentally
clearing out your notifications for an
unlocked phone it also comes with quite
a few bloatware applications
pre-installed like booking comm CNN
TripAdvisor News Republic and lyft if
you're used to emotion UI then this will
all feel very familiar but it may not be
an experience that you'll enjoy if you
prefer something closer to stock Android
if you're considering picking up an
honor 6x it's going to put a very small
dent in your wallet it's going for -
$49.99 unlocked which is low enough of a
price that doesn't step on the toes I've
even the most budget of flagships like
the 1 + 3 T the axon 7 or even Wobblies
own honor
8 because those are battles that this
phone simply cannot win the honor 6x
knows exactly what it's meant to be and
it's a smart phone package that offers a
lot without asking a lot with dual
cameras a long lasting battery and
excellent fingerprint sensor and an
asking price of only two and $50 the
honor 6x is going to one of the most
competitive phones that you'll be able
to find in this particular price bracket
