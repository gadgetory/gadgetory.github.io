Hindy the android authority app guide
it's Friday which means it's time for
another episode of Google Play weekly
this week we're going to talk about an
awesome new chromecast application
called castaway the Google now launcher
which was just released to the Google
Play Store teasin whatsapp and a whole
lot more so let's get started let's
start out this week with some good news
if you're a fan of real cloud player and
you live somewhere other than the United
States and Canada and have been waiting
for a global release than today is your
lucky day since februari 24th realplayer
cloud has been available to the entire
world there have been a lot of noted
benefits to realplayer cloud in the past
including being one of the first apps to
have chromecast support unfortunately
chromecast isn't available to everyone
in the world yet which well still sucks
here are some quick stats about the
application if you don't know anything
about it you get two gigabytes of cloud
storage with the application and
additional storage starts at five
dollars per month you can also get a
free gigabyte of storage for every one
you refer to the application it supports
most video formats allows for HD video
streaming and has Roku support also it's
free to download in the Play Store right
now our next bit of news is really more
of a well dug kind of thing because
pretty much everybody knew that the
Google now launcher would eventually
make its way to the Google Play Store
which it now has okay so here's the good
news it is in fact in the google play
store right now free of charge it comes
with all the features you'd find on the
Nexus 5 including the ok Google command
phrase the built-in google now the
larger icons and the new home screen
organizational structure for a lot of
people this is not new information
unfortunately there is also some bad
news the app is currently only
compatible with Google Play experience
devices and Nexus devices that are
running Android 4.4 Kit Kats of course
you can just download the extra files
and install it yourself which is
surprisingly easy to do and while the
link to that in the video description
should you want to try it out so as it
turns out whatsapp made an appearance at
Mobile World Congress is here to
announce an upcoming feature that adds
phone calls it wasn't long ago that
Facebook bought the popular chat service
to the attune of 19 billion dollars and
it appears that development is moving
along according to schedule according to
the presentation made by the company CEO
the feature should be rolling out to
people by quarter to of this year
so far there has been no official word
about pricing word around the digital
water cooler is that the service will be
free at least to start with our own
andrew grush postulated that the service
would be free for a year and then every
subsequent year there'd be an annual fee
I personally think he's right because
that fits with the current what's a
pricing pattern which makes sense and it
would all the income which fits
Facebook's motives and that also makes
sense so have you been offended lately
no well our next story should fix that
okay so there was an application
released recently called the bro app the
pro app is a piece of garbage that
automatically texted your girlfriend so
you can pay less attention to her and
more attention to your quote Bros
unquote the app refers to it as
outsourcing your love life and claims to
be able to let you ignore your
significant other entirely while you do
other things whether or not the
developers had control of their mental
faculties when they conceived this
application remains a subject of intense
debates it's been almost unanimously
considered sexist by tech pundits
including this guy and let's face facts
people who use an application like this
are people who really shouldn't be
talking to women anyway one editorial
claimed the app only exists because of
television shows that promote the bro
lifestyle like how i met your mother i
maintain you can't blame television for
the actions of stupid people unless
they're watching mtv and this year's
Mobile World Congress infrared
developers of Polaris Office showed off
just how easy it can be to port an
Android application to teasin it's
apparently really simple to convert
android apps entities and apps using a
tool called Polaris app generator here's
how it works you run the application
through the app generator and it spits
out an app that it's compatible with
teasin the service won't be free and
each app that gets the T's and treatment
will cost about five thousand dollars
and support will last for about two
years the exorbitant charge according to
infrared is to keep pirates from
stealing popular android apps how they
are able to do this is rather simple and
I am oversimplifying it just a little
bit essentially they add a standalone
dalvik runtime to the application which
allows it to run inside of teasin
without the abb√© de being forced to
change anything it is then converted
into a teasin executive or file and it's
ready to go if Samsung ever releases a
tease and phone this will probably
become a much bigger deal who's ready
for some trending applications as usual
if you want to check any of these
applications out you can find the links
in the rain
companion which is in the video
description first up this week is mcafee
antivirus and security at Mobile World
Congress this year they announced a new
pricing scheme which essentially makes
all of their best features free so now
all the stuff like anti virus anti theft
and all the features they are in are
totally free there is still a
subscription service for two dollars and
ninety-nine cents a month or 29 99 a
year that adds two gigabytes of backup
space for photos and videos phone
support and removes all of the
advertisements this is way better than
it used to be you may remember punch
quest from last year when it was
released it is an infinite runner where
you play as a dude that punches
everything and every now and then gets
to ride a dinosaur that shoots laser
beams the app was recently updated to
include new enemies and achievements
it's also now free as the developer has
decided to go with an in-app purchase
model instead of a paid model if you've
been hesitating to check this out now is
a great time to try it our next title
called out there OneTouch arcades most
anticipated mobile game of 2014 award
and for a good reason this is an
atmospheric melancholy space game where
you must survive the harsh conditions of
being in outer space it includes more
than 300 adventures that results in
three different main quest endings
item-crafting Google Play game services
and it even goes so far as to craft a
new universe every time you play it's
four dollars in the google play store
right now some of you may have heard of
one drive back when it was called
SkyDrive Microsoft has updated the
application to better compete with
services like Dropbox and Google Drive
this includes automatic up loads of
photos and videos better integration
with other Microsoft services larger
thumbnails and of course the boilerplate
bug fixes and performance improvements
if you've never used it you can get 10
gigabytes of storage right out of the
gate by signing up for the service so
there is that last up this week as an
application called cast away and if you
have a chromecast then this could be the
very next app that you download cast
away is good for only one thing and
that's streaming locally stored files on
your Android device to your chromecast
it's free to use and aside from the
occasional hiccup it seems to work
really well well that about wraps it up
for the world of applications this week
