Joe handy the Android authority app guy
and we're at that point in February
where it's time to round up the best new
Android games that were released over
the last month if you want to check out
any of those games for yourself you can
find those links in the video
description below a boy and his blob is
a port of the classic NES game of the
same name it has received a visual
revamping to look better but it
otherwise the same game as it was before
you'll play as a boy along with a blob
and your job is to defeat the Emperor
and save the world
it features platforming and puzzle
mechanics as you navigate from place to
place and doing various things it runs
well enough on most devices you'll fork
out $4.99 for the game and there are no
in-app purchases Batman Arkham
underworld is the latest time killer
from Warner Bros unlike most this one
lets you play as the villains from the
Batman universe
you'll be recruiting bad guys building
hideouts raiding hideouts of other
players and completing levels with your
team it's a mix of an adventure game and
a castle builder as such your heels for
gain new abilities there is a PvP online
multiplayer and you can play with
friends if you want to it is a freemium
game and that means it comes with some
of the pitfalls that you'd expect it
also has a few bugs here and there that
still need fixed otherwise it's a good
way to kill a few minutes but the fun
Britain sales - is a new adventure game
with a sense of humor it features four
playable characters a humorous
pop-culture late storyline is over 20
hours of gameplay
it also features seasoned voice acting a
little bit less graphic in addition
there are SciQuest subtitles for free
languages anymore
you'll be bonding to the storyline
solving puzzles and avoiding danger and
overall is actually a crazy game you'll
pay $4.99 for the game but there are no
and adverts in Fire Emblem Heroes is
Nintendo's first big release of 2017
it's a made for mobile RPG with gotcha
mechanics and that means you'll spend
your time going through the storyline
playing special events and trying to
collect powerful characters it's wicked
smooth plays great and Nintendo has
added some small touches to other games
in the genre usually don't it also keeps
the strategy RPG elements and characters
from the original Fire Emblem games
it's a freemium game but it's probably
one of the best ones ever made good dogs
is a fun little time killer it's an
infinite runner where you pick a dog and
then try to run through the park for as
long as possible it's connected to the
popular rear eight dogs twitter account
which you should definitely check out by
the way there are 7 dogs to collect
stuff to customise the dogs and the
developer promises to change up the
parts on a monthly basis truth be told
it's not much more than a time killer
however the in-app purchases are for
in-app customizations only and not a gem
system it's kid-friendly adult friendly
click to play and it's free heart star
is a simple little platformer puzzler
you'll play as two girls and you must
make both of them reach the end of the
level
the pink girl can only jump on pink
platforms while the blue one can only
jump on the blue one does she'll have to
switch back and forth in order to get
everyone safely to the end it's a fun
quick play although we do wish the game
had Google Play game support it does
still contain 50 levels and the game is
completely free with no in-app purchases
about the only thing you'll have to deal
with is some advertising
Pokemon dual is the latest Pokemon game
to hit mobile unlike others this one
bills itself as a strategy board game
the general idea is to get your Pokemon
into your opponent's goal before they do
each player will have six pokemons to
play with and there is luck in this game
so sometimes you're going to get matched
even if you do everything right it's a
freemium game and that means it has a
lot of those pitfalls some people really
don't like nevertheless it's fun to play
even if it's just for a little while
real Myst is a port of the original Myst
game originally released on PC back in
the 1990s it has been remastered with
new graphics along with touchscreen
controls otherwise it's the same old
missed game that many of us know and
love you'll get a hint system to help
you out with those more difficult
puzzles and for those who have never
played Myst is a puzzle game that also
features exploration
it's a gorgeous game and at $6.99 with
no in-app purchases it's an excellent
deal as well so far reviewers haven't
complained too much about bugs and we
didn't find anything serious either sky
dancer is an infinite runner with some
fun mechanics you'll be doing the usual
running and dodging while you also make
massive jumps along with that you'll
have ten characters to play with
multiple challenges to complete and the
game looks pretty decent too like most
newer games there are some bugs here and
there that can be a little bit annoying
but on the plus side it does have Google
Play games cloud saving so you can
continue on other devices
it's a freemium game and a fun little
time killer strange phone is an
adventure game that's based around a
telephone you'll play as a girl named
Jill who was stuck in an alternate
dimension and you'll be using a phone to
dial into various worlds in order to
find the items to help get her home each
phone number sends you to a different
world to explore and that means you can
redial the same number over and over
again and go back to the world if you
need to it's all wrapped up in some
charming retro graphics you'll fork out
three dollars and 99 cents with no
in-app purchases if you're interested
