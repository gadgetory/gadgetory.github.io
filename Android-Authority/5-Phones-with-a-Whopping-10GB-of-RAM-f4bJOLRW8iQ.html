need taking a buddy to rim my PC has six
wait what is real I need ten gigabytes
of RAM just like you need 25 pairs of
shoes like it takes you four hours to go
buy a pair of pants I need 10 gigabytes
RAM because I'm a man who needs to know
there's juice under the hood that didn't
come out right
all right it's time for unapologetic
geekery we're gonna start off our list
with number one the 1 plus 60 the 1 plus
60 was already a great phone with a
flagship level hardware and software for
a price that is much less compared to
its direct competition now the company
has gone ahead and launched a new
version of that phone that packs in 10
gigabytes of RAM 2 gigabytes higher than
what you would get from the regular
version however the 1 plus 6 McClaren
Edition sold in collaboration with the
well-known uk-based supercar maker and
f1 constructor it is still priced for
far less than most phones with similar
specs the phone does have some visual
differences as well it's made of black
carbon fiber design with MacLaren's logo
and its trademark papaya orange color
around the rim and even using the phones
in screen fingerprint reader showing
some orange animation now aside from the
10 gigabyte of RAM the biggest Hardware
difference between the McLaren Edition
and the regular edition is that this has
a warp charge 30 so-called
so as to give the phone a day's worth of
battery charge in just 20 minutes yet
with all the extra RAM and fast charging
the oneplus sixty McLaren Edition is
priced just at $6.99 which is quite
reasonable now next up is the me mix 3
and its Forbidden City special edition
this special edition not only sports 10
gigabytes of RAM but sports a 256
gigabytes of internal storage it will
sell in its home country for 4999 1 or
American 720 dollars the me mix 3 has a
six point three nine inch AMOLED display
with 23 40 by 1080 resolution and a 1959
aspect ratio the rear camera setup has
dual 12 mega pick
sensors and the front-facing camera
includes a main 24 megapixel sensor and
secondary 12 megapixel camera for cool
portrait effects and next up is the
xiaomi black shark hello now this is the
second release in the new gaming themed
black shark smartphone line in addition
to the standard models with 6 gigabytes
and 8 gigabytes of RAM Xiaomi will
release a version of the black shark
helo with 10 gigabytes RAM
along with 256 gigabytes of storage
however there is no word on the price or
release date for that version other
hardware specs include a 6 inch 2160 by
1080 display this Snapdragon 845 chipset
2 rear cameras with 12 megapixels and 20
megapixel sensors a 20 megapixel
front-facing camera and a big 4000
million power battery however this is
supposed to be a gaming themed phone and
the black shark hilo has features like
the gaming studio which lets you
customize the settings for things like
better processing speed touch
sensitivity display refresh and network
speed and next up is the Nubia red magic
Mars now if you live in China you can
get a version with 10 gigabytes of RAM
and 256 gigabytes of storage for 3999
1 or 575 American there's no word yet on
if this phone will be released outside
of China the phone has a large 6-inch
display but does use an old-fashioned
IPS LCD touchscreen it does come with a
Snapdragon 845 processor and Android 9pi
but there's just one rear 16 megapixel
camera along with an 8 megapixel front
camera and a 38 hundred million power
battery the red magic Mars adds in
capacity keys that serve as a shoulder
trigger for games and the Nubia will
sell an optional game controller that
connects with the side of the phone all
in all the Nubia red magic red is an
example of a phone that puts in high-end
features like 10 gigabytes RAM but cuts
corners with other things like the LCD
screen and finally next up is the vivo
next dual display edition in addition to
the 10 gigabytes of RAM it has the
Snapdragon 845 processor 128 gigabytes
of on-board storage 3500 milliamp
our battery and an in display
fingerprint scanner however the biggest
feature in this handset as you might
have guessed from its name is not only
that it has a six point three nine inch
OLED 2340 by 1080 resolution screen but
has a five point four nine inch OLED
1920 1080 resolution on the back how
much do you care about that I want to
know in the comments below would you
actually fork out that money for that
feature or those added features because
those prices are pretty darn reasonable
let me know in the comments below I'm
looking forward to reading this one you
know what software starts do things it's
not supposed to do who solves those
problems
