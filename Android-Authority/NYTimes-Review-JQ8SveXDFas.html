Hindy the android authority app guy the
New York Times have rereleased their
application and we're going to take a
closer look at it perhaps the most
prominent change the new york times app
is the user interface they have
abandoned their prior design almost
entirely in favor of a much newer far
fresher interface that contains heaps of
Android holo with a pinch of material
design thrown in for good measure we
can't emphasize enough how quick and
smooth the new interface is and it's
clear without resignation that a lot of
work went into it upon starting the
application you'll see categories lined
up across the top of the screen you can
swipe left and right between them to
browse the various sections of the New
York Times in the overflow or the
three-dot menu in the top right you can
customize which categories you see
across the top of the screen in the
hamburger menu in the top left you'll
also see your top ten favorite
categories along with a list of all
categories and New York Times properties
that you can engage with this new
swiping functionality is consistently
present across practically all screens
you can easily swipe to the next article
or back to the old one and some articles
even have a comment section that you can
swipe around as well at any point you
can open the left menu by swiping in
from the left side of the screen there
are also dedicated phone and tablet
interfaces so you can enjoy content no
matter the size of the screen it is also
worth mentioning that the articles
themselves now follow a singular format
with rich or media than before and that
makes them more enjoyable the UI
definitely took center stage but the
application does contain a number of
other useful features in the settings
menu you can control things like
notifications categories and your
account settings if you decide to sign
up for a new york time subscription you
can use the app for free although you
are limited to 10 articles per month
whereas subscribers generally get full
access you can expect two kinds of
notifications from this application one
is a breaking news notification that
will pop up whenever big news is
happening during my testing I received
one when the NFL Draft started and a few
others the second type of notification
is called the morning brief that occurs
every single morning this serves up the
important news from overnight to get you
caught up quickly there are also two
kinds of widgets that you can use the
first is a fairly standard widget that
shows you the latest headlines you can
scroll through the
and tap on stories to launch the app and
read them the second is a brand new
widget that shows interesting
photographs throughout the day tapping
on the photographs will launch the
relevant article in addition you also
have a twilight mode to darken the
screen for easier reading the ability to
switch between the u.s. and
international editions of the New York
Times and multiple links to send
feedback about the application if you
have comments complaints or suggestions
here's what we liked about the new New
York Times application the new interface
is simply stunning we've seen few news
applications embrace the Android design
guidelines and fewer still who have done
it as well as the New York Times has
here we especially enjoyed the
consistent swipe controls on the main
interface and articles as well as the
grid layout for tablets it is one of the
best performing Android news apps that
we've ever used articles load quickly of
course internet connection permitting
swiping between categories and articles
has a satisfying smoothness that just
screams high class when combined with
the simplistic elegance of the new
interface the notifications are
consistent enough to be useful but not
so consistent that it becomes an
annoyance the morning brief is an
excellent way to get caught up on what's
going on and we like that both types of
notifications can be configured in the
settings you have the ability to save
articles and read them across multiple
devices of course you do need a
subscription to do that this means you
can start reading a story on your phone
and continue reading it on your tablet
or computer later or vice versa the
widgets included are simple but
effective they can be resized to an
extent to fit your home screen needs
we'd like to talk for a moment about the
subscriptions the New York Times offers
more than half a dozen subscription
options and three of them are for their
online content subscriptions are
generally an all-or-nothing proposition
and we appreciate the ability to go for
a cheaper or more specialized option for
instance if you don't own a tablet you
can get a smartphone only subscription
and here's what wasn't so great about
the new york times app the application
as a whole is a total refresh that means
many of the features from the old
application are now gone this has perks
some folks but the developers have been
attentive in fixing issues and taking
suggestions to reintegrate popular old
features you can expect the application
to change a great deal over the coming
months
when scrolling through the photo widget
we noticed that there were only about a
half a dozen photos we would have liked
to have seen more photos there it does
auto update over the course of the day
so this really is a minor nitpick the
new york times app developers clearly
wanted to go in a new direction and they
succeeded in their endeavor entirely the
emphasis on quick loading and buttery
smooth performance meshes well with the
high standards of the publication's
content and the two combined create one
of the greatest news reading experiences
available on Android today that said the
app is still in its infancy and we
expect more features to be rolled out
over time to make up for the features
lost in the transition overall it's a
fantastic application you can read
articles and test the app out for free
before committing to a subscription so
there's no actual harm in trying it out
for yourself the download link is in the
