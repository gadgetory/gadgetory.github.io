Hindy the android authority app guy with
an ecosystem as large as androids it's
inevitable that some developers are
going to screw up royal with that in
mind let's take a look at the most
controversial apps and games of 2015
Android pay was announced a heavy
fanfare at Google i/o the premise was
easy enough to understand it was to be a
revamped and improved tap tap a system
that rivaled Apple pay and could be used
throughout the Android ecosystem by
applications games and even online
retailers the rollout of the service has
left a little bit to be desired for
starters the new Android pay doesn't
work on rooted devices for security
reasons this is in stark contrast to
google wallet which worked on rooted and
non rooted devices alike and earth to
think of root community so badly the
Google employees actually took to the
XDA forums to explain what happened to
follow it up Google Wallet was then
gutted and turned into a paypal clone
with its biggest feature being able to
send and receive money from friends and
manage your account which her features
had actually already had in classic
Google fashion the applications do work
together but feel disjointed as a whole
everyone has calmed down about it now
but you can still find remnants of a
start that wasn't pretty and people who
still aren't happy about the whole thing
the developers of Monument Valley may
have won the most controversial tweet
from a mobile game developer in 2015
when they tweeted that five percent of
their Android installs were paid for and
ninety-five percent were not despite us
to not saying one damn word about piracy
this sparked quite the commotion and
began one of the most in-depth
discussions about mobile piracy to date
not only was the problem unleashed upon
the masses in a way it had never been
done before but it also encouraged other
developers to post about their numbers
and show that piracy really is a problem
on mobile unfortunately instead of it
being a positive thing people through a
proverbial temper tantrum as pirates
across the internet took to the message
boards to defend themselves they used
every internet troll trick in the book
from calling us to flat-out liars to
taking the numbers out of context to
create fallacious arguments the backfire
was so bad that us too did an interview
with recode to try to calm everybody
down the meltdown did eventually blow
over and of course nothing good came of
it's almost hilariously modern combat 5
blackout went freemium just two months
later and people simply couldn't under
dan why apple had every chance in the
world to make a good impression on
Android users with their first Android
app the whispers that they would be
joining the google play store had been
around for a year or longer so it was
really never a question if but rather a
question of when maybe iTunes for
Android or perhaps Apple music nope
Apple's first Android app was to help
Android users leave Android to start
with the application actually does quite
well it transfers all of your stuff to
Apple services so you can just sign in
to your next iPhone and be ready to go
of course this was taken as a huge
offense to the android fan boys and
girls who immediately took to the
applications page on Google Play to
unleash probably the heaviest stream of
one star ratings I've seen since
Facebook home this created yet another
divide in the Android user space between
people who relentlessly trolled Apple
and those who found that sort of
behavior rather childish the vitriol
even sparked a parody application called
stick with Android that has received ten
thousand five star ratings and has a 4.8
Google Play rating in the play store
right now the move to iOS thing has all
but subsided but the impact can still be
seen with every Apple release as they
now get a slew of one star ratings just
because it was released by apple
pushbullet became the latest victim of
actually trying to make money off of
their platform and it seems like they
went about it the wrong way the popular
platform is considered the de facto
solution for transferring files between
computers and mobile phones and the
extra features such as texting from PC
Universal copy and paste and others made
it a fan favorite that is of course
until they started charging fifty bucks
a year for it what made pushbullet so
interesting was that it did nothing
wrong it's still a great application
with great features and great stability
the problem seems to be centered around
how they went about transitioning into a
paid application users have lamented the
allegedly exorbitant cost of pushbullet
pro and how the free version was gutted
to make the premium version look better
which some people felt was insulting the
pushback was so intense that the
pushbullet team took to ready to do an
ama which seems to have calmed the
public down quite a bit as of now the
price remains five dollars per month or
fifty dollars a year and the competition
has been trying to take advantage of
that telegram is actually a really good
messaging service that focuses on
encryption security and privacy now if
they could only do something about all
of those terrorists that keep wanting to
use their service
yes it's true telegram received a lot of
press this year after it was reported
that Isis encouraged members to use the
application in order to talk privately
about their various Isis activities so
the government's couldn't track them the
applications developers caught a little
extra flak after some footage from
TechCrunch Disrupt was dug up that
showed the developers knew that Isis was
using their app since then they've tried
to make things right by shutting down
dozens of Isis channels but they seem to
keep coming back this whole development
came about after the attacks from Paris
so it was fairly recent but so far
telegram has seemed to rebound nicely
after it cleaned up a bit our loyal
readers may remember Yik yak from its
inclusion in our most controversial apps
of 2014 yes it's here again and believe
it or not it managed to top its
performance from last year it started
with that huge thing at Missouri
University that I'm sure most of you
have heard about you may have heard
about two students who were arrested for
issuing death threats to black people
correct yeah well they did that on Yik
yak that wasn't the only racism that
found its way into this application
Princeton University has had problems
with it all year while a Colorado
Springs student was suspended after
racist comments concerning black women
there has been more than one movement to
ban the service from college campuses
but they have all been highly
unsuccessful so far about all the app
developers have done is placed geo
fences around middle and high school
areas to prevent kids from using it in
October of 2015 Google removed the
application from its top charts we won't
know how effective that will be in the
long term but don't be surprised that
this app is right back here again next
year once again I'm Joe Hindy the
