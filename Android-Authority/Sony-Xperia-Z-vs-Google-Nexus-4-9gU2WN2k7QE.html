Authority what's going on everybody and
today we got a good vs for you with the
comeback device for Sony the Xperia Z
and the comeback device for LG the
Google Nexus 4 we're going to do things
a little differently now since we
already have full reviews for both of
these devices we'll just go through the
differences and pick a winner in each
category we'll start with the design and
the Sony Xperia Z this is a design we
don't see enough of these days with it's
fully rectangular form in angular
corners it is black glass and flat all
around giving it an appealing black
slate look the buttons are all found on
the right with a silver power button
above the volume rockers plastic covers
protect the ports for water resistance
in the hand it is easy to grip the flat
sides though the bigger form due to the
big screen does make you adjust your
hand accordingly the Nexus 4 on the
other hand benefits from a smaller
screen for a form factor that is easier
to hold its design is tried-and-true
rounded corners and a pebble form like
other phones in its size it is
completely glass as well which makes
this a very attractive device in its own
right the button layout is typical with
a power button on the right side
opposite the volume rockers the smaller
size makes this phone easy to maneuver
around in one hand so in terms of
straight design the Xperia Z gets credit
for successfully being different and
beautiful but it will yield a learning
curve for those use to smaller screens
and for that reason it gets the design
points but the more accessible Nexus 4
it gets the point four feel this one is
ultimately a tie for screen and display
the Xperia Z could have the advantage
with a 5-inch 1080p display with a very
impressive 441 PPI pixel density it is a
very sharp
screen with more than adequate
brightness but it is the viewing angles
that suffer at any which angle the
fidelity of the display suffers pretty
greatly which actually evens the playing
field for the Nexus 4 which has the
smaller 4.7 inch display at a lower 720p
resolution and 318 PPI it is a very good
bright and vibrant performer with much
better viewing angles you can see here
how the Xperia Z loses more fidelity at
an angle than the Nexus 4 but I do get
it 5-inch 1080p displays are the future
the Xperia Z still has a very fun
display despite those
which actually don't bother me as much
and it is still a good example of this
particular screen form factor so this
one would also be a time because while
the viewing angles are a bummer the
1080p display is still a fun advantage
over the Nexus 4's display you would
think that performance skews in favor of
the newer Xperia Z but that is only part
of the story this is because the Sony
flagship has the same package found in
the Nexus 4 the Qualcomm Snapdragon s4
pro backed by an Adreno 320 GPU and 2
gigabytes of RAM and to to benchmark did
showed the Xperia Z breaking the 20000
barrier while the Nexus 4 lands right
below it so perhaps the Xperia Z still
has the edge but with the same processor
package what you're looking at here is
optimization and software for speed so
this will technically be a tie-in pure
performance as well
hardware is where the differences really
begin because the Xperia Z comes with 16
gigabytes of memory and the base model
twice that of the Nexus 4's base 8
gigabytes connectivity is largely the
same for both though an LTE version of
the Xperia Z is available however the
Nexus 4's unibody design doesn't allow
for replaceable batteries or expandable
memory while one of the Xperia Z's many
plastic flaps covers and SD card slots
while it might not have a replaceable
battery this one feature gives the
Xperia Z the hardware point software
might seem like a no-brainer for some
and they would mostly be right the
Google Nexus 4 has the advantage off the
bat for having the newest version of
Android jelly bean 4.2.2 it also is
backed by Google's update schedule
making it the guaranteed most updated
smartphone its software is also the
stock experience which many people
prefer Sony's Xperia Z on the other hand
is a little behind with jellybean 4.1.2
it takes design elements from Ice Cream
Sandwich however with dark tones
accented by primary colors the Xperia UI
gets credit for bringing together the
very nice ICS look with the updated
jellybean software like Google now and
finally Sony's own additions like the
small apps despite all of that effort
however the Google Nexus 4 it gets the
edge for being the experienced US
Android purists pine over having
Google's backing definitely makes the
Nexus 4 one of the most appealing
Android devices so it gets this point
and then we move over to the camera the
Xperia Z might not have the most
updated Android but the 13 megapixel
Exmor RS camera still has tricks up its
sleeve Sony's pedigree with camera
optics is apparent with the inclusion of
superior Auto which automatically finds
the right settings for the scene you're
trying to capture burst modes and
sweeping panorama are two other features
available as far as picture quality goes
photos have good color reproduction and
details are captured very well the Nexus
4's 8 megapixel camera might not be as
powerful but the updated camera app is
very appealing with a UI that takes
advantage of touch and swipe features
found on a smartphone display the camera
also has HDR and panorama features
photosphere however is the main addition
360 degree shots that are much like
Street View video photos quality is good
though in this picture of a sweet BMW a
lens flare on the top left washes out
some of the color ultimately the picture
quality goes to the more camera
experienced sony its pictures just look
a little more appealing and pleasing
than the ones from the nexus 4 and with
its full-featured camera application
even if it's missing photosphere it does
get the point here and finally we have
usage and price so far these two devices
are neck and neck with the Xperia Z
getting a small edge over the Nexus 4
after the camera comparison but for the
most part the usage for both will
largely be the same unless you're
looking for something specific those who
want the 5 inch 1080p display will love
the Xperia Z even if its viewing angles
do suffer but it's not the biggest deal
to everyone on the other hand those
unsure about the larger form factor can
look to the Nexus 4 for the most updated
and stock experience its screen is still
more than capable and its smaller size
makes it more accessible so it comes
down to price well the premium Xperia Z
can be up to $800 for just a base 16
gigabyte model for all it offers many
people can find this price worth it on
the other hand the Nexus 4 gives about
the same performance in a smaller form
factor and it comes in at only 299
dollars that price along with the
software advantage makes the Nexus 4 a
tough one to beat so while there have
been ties throughout this the final
tally will go to the Google Nexus 4 find
what you want from both of these top
performers in their respective sizes and
you will still be happy with the choice
that you make though
tell us what you think in the comments
below do you think the Xperia Z should
have blown the Nexus far away or do you
agree with the result let us know here
