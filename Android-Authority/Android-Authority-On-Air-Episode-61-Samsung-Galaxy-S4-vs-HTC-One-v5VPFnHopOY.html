original android hangout show on google+
I'm Derek Ross I'm Scott Anderson I'm
Johnathan Franklin I'm Chris look
welcome to the show guys so we have a
lot to talk about this week we have tons
of ecosystem news google was behind some
companies some tablet optimization was
added to the Play Store Google basically
said hey Facebook you're not allowed to
do something indirectly we have some
earning earnings reports from all the
big guys this week as the 1st quarter of
2013 comes to an end we have all sorts
of app updates airdroid some keyboards a
facebook home at a whole bunch of
installs but who's actually using it
onto device and carrier news t-mobile
and MetroPCS tied the knot officially
and it actually uh becomes official May
first but they that they tie the knot we
have some more device news such as the
galaxy s4 some google TV information and
we'll wrap it up with patent wars as
usual so so let's get started and talk
about some ecosystem news for those of
you that are glass explorers or hoping
to use glass
in the future you might be a little
saddened to know that Eric Schmidt said
this week that glass would likely be
available to consumers in 2014 well he
really didn't say that he said glass
would probably be available in a year
ish so probably is not the best word for
a time frame in year ish isn't the best
word for a time frame either but a year
ish from now puts it in 2014 or so so
yeah if you're if you're a glass
Explorer you'll you'll be using it for a
while before the general public gets
ahold of it um i mentioned that google
bought a company they google supposedly
acquired wavy is that is that how you
say that mmm that's Tom saying it wavy
so wavy is an application that
aggregates news that it thinks that
you're interested in and is relevant to
you the rumor is you know speculated
that Google will be integrating wave
ease natural language technology into
the knowledge graph and services and
elsewhere so you know Google is all
about the knowledge graph and contextual
data and being able to provide relevant
information to users so that sounds like
it's a good acquisition from google
standpoint no I'm not interested to see
what they're going to do with it you
know especially when they buy that as a
company like this um google added tablet
optimization tips to the Google Play
Developer console now you're able to
provide proactively scan apps to be uh
plated for tablet compatibility and it
provides developer feedback in real time
but you know the details on that isn't
really a big deal you know the the fact
that they are making tablet optimization
update so Google is in really pushing
Android tablets it is still which
they've been doing that since the Nexus
7 you know first first
launched speaking of tablets what about
Android notebooks there's some
interesting tidbits and news this week
on the in the Android world about
notebooks in Intel executive said that
200 notebook $200 notebooks are on the
way and you know as well as I do you
really can't buy two hundred dollar
intel-based notebook there there you a
lot more expensive than that so how are
they going to get there are they going
to be atom processors that that run
Android you know with windows 8 being
the ? that it is in Microsoft's business
model for licensing being the way that
it is where you know windows is pretty
expensive it's a hundred bucks so is it
going to be Android you know are we
going to see an Android tablet who
really knows but there's a lot of
speculation about that and perhaps mercy
a touchscreen you know convertible pc
with in with android running in no this
is confirmed but a lot of there's been a
lot of speculation around the around the
internet the past the past week about
this you know we we like speculation
because a gives us on the talk about
right it's fun ah I don't think it's
it's a probable in my opinion I don't
know I think android makes a good you
know notebook operating system but then
again I've never used a transformer
prime and those of you that have used a
transformer prime you love that keyboard
dock and you once you dock it the most
of you never take that keyboard dock off
and keep it on there and use it as a
notebook so those are some of battery
life and so apparently there is a market
for them so we'll see what Intel does
it's a it's up in the air right now it's
just it's just speculation um Facebook
announces their biggest developer party
yet and guess what it is it's the night
before Google i/o interesting to see
what happens there they said the
Facebook promise that you'll be able to
meet people from the Facebook team and
other top notch Android developers so
that's interesting
interested to see you know what they're
what they're pushing with that you know
because Facebook has been heavily
entrenched and Android for a while now
well with their Android campaign around
the office to switch to Android and now
with their their home application which
we'll get to a little bit more
information a little bit so it's a I'm
surprised you know that they're holding
us you guys think anything you know
they're they're looking to do they're
just looking to strengthen their foot
foothold with Android a thing they're
probably trying to get in with that
Android developers to try to because
Facebook integrates ads for Android
applications already in their own apps
of any of their probably trying to play
nice with Android developers to give
them to warm up to Facebook as a
platform to tell me push that probably
that make sense it's uh I think I think
they're definitely playing buddy buddy
and trying to you know bring some people
over to their side so to speak I guess
all right so so speaking of Facebook did
Google did something just to just a
little bit ago earlier today google
updated their Google Play Developer
console that will actually updated the
google play content policy so if you're
a developer yo developer account when
you sign in you get a nice pop up
message the popup message says Google
Play content policies have been updated
see content policy section which
clarifies that and app downloaded from
Google Play may not modify replace or
update its own APK binary code using any
method other than Google play's update
mechanism Google Play is a trusted
source for Android applications and we
are committed to providing a secure and
consistent experience so the first thing
that comes to mind to me is remember
over the past month or a month or so ago
people that had facebook installed
started getting uh pop-ups or
notification saying hey download the
latest facebook update and
Facebook downloaded itself it didn't
download it from the Play Store Facebook
was was installing updates without the
Play Store so that's that's an
interesting way to do things I mean it's
it's cutting Google out of the mix but
the biggest thing is is that it's
allowing an app to download updates from
who knows where where as Google said
they're a known trusted source you know
so so you want to download from the
known trusted source you want to
download from a third-party server that
could have been hacked me you know you
know it's not saying it happens but
we're even a bell with malicious intent
gives you a nice little apt to warm you
up to it and it just decided they want
to put some malware on there exactly any
off of you I mean and the fact that you
know permissions could change the apps
these apps aren't being scanned for
malware by Google you know bouncers not
scanning them so it's good that Google
did this and I can't think of any app
recently that has tried to do this so
this is basically a hey Facebook you
know uh uh uh you know we we saw what
you were doing so we updated our don't
continue yeah what you did there face
yeah we see what you do there and we
don't like it so basically if Facebook
continues to do that I'm not up on all
the content policy rules and regulations
but I see people getting removed their
apps removed from the google play store
for violating content policies all the
time so if Facebook if they don't comply
which I'm sure they will would be stupid
for them not to if they wouldn't they
could potentially have their app removed
from the Play Store
which which would be all sorts of
hilarious let me have money because
because we like Google+ we're on google+
facebook bad anyways fine I have
something to say about that but alright
wiki tell me how is facebook what do you
want to say it's just that you know
recently I did a review the HTC first
and it's actually kind of cool and that
you can get really right to stock jelly
bean right off the bat I mean as soon as
you turn off facebook home you've got
basically stopped jelly bean oh and
that's all it using yeah that is very
cool um HTC will probably never update
it again but at the same time it's cool
to be able to just you know see like
literally stock jelly bean like you know
you would get from a rom but uh I had to
reactivate my facebook for the first
time in about I don't know a year and a
half maybe even longer and I instantly
remembered why i deleted my facebook or
deactivated it it's just most people's
friends and status updates just aren't
enough aren't good enough to consume
your entire homes for me it just what
you don't like to know like you know
what they're eating what kind of naughty
pictures they're looking at what they're
thinking out there feeling you know like
the mat as you know number now why I
don't hang out with a lot of the people
I used to hang out with people realized
waking up to go to work in the morning
and then getting home to throw some
clothes in the laundry and then having
to cook for yourself is something that's
like superhuman that nobody else has to
do on a daily basis but I don't
constantly have to be reminded of it you
know personally yeah okay so so uh that
really wraps it up for ecosystem news so
uh you know let's move on to the money
you know people want people to know
about the money how our company's doing
are they
they making money and they losing money
you know so so we had q1 2013 numbers
come in John you want to tell us a
little bit about them you know pretty
much everyone's putting out their
earnings reports right about now and
hopefully appeasing shareholders uh the
first one notable one was Apple it was
kind of speculated that they were going
to see a profit margin decrease in which
turned out to be true the net net income
max dropped about eighteen percent
compared to this time last year the
revenue itself was actually up eleven
percent over the last quarter the iphone
sales kind of slow down slow down a good
bit they grew three percent during the
quarter and that the the fourth
consecutive quarter of actual declining
gross profit margin by percentage which
is actually the longest stretch since
1993 specifically it's at four to thirty
seven point five percent now versus 47.4
percent a year ago um nelson elsa plan
to reward shareholders by doubling their
program to return cash to shareholders
via stock buybacks and higher dividend
so they're basically going to be
spending 100 billion dollars on the
effort through 2015 which is ridiculous
the share purchases themselves will be
it's going to go up to sixty billion
from where what was ten billion so
that's the largest planet history to so
basically they're helping out all the
discworld stockholders by investing into
themselves but i guess the biggest thing
to note is that the ipad mini
realistically its existence has heard
the ipad lineup because it doesn't pull
any where near the profit margin that
the larger iPad does and then even
though they're selling a lot of iphones
they're starting to sell a lot more than
older lower profit margin devices like
the four and the 4s instead of the five
so what they really needs is to really
hit one other park as far as a new
hardware device innovation or a new
market altogether to really get that
profitability back
do you guys know at what point they
stopped manufacturing a iphone like
model you know I would have guessed a
within the years ago seems to be the you
know the 3gs doesn't exist anymore so i
would think that um like two years you
think i would i would think that one the
5s or six or whatever it ends up being
comes out then the four will probably be
deprecated i would think that's usually
what they do well so i mean i don't see
any point of continuing carrying the
four i mean it's you know I ancient by
today's standards but I'm not a terrible
phone probably know for certain people
but the fact that matter is is that you
know Apple that that's their first
profit decrease in 10 years that's
that's big news that's you know and
apples been struggling that you know to
stay above four hundred dollars a share
for four weeks now there they've really
become a victim of their own success and
Samsung is probably in a kind of became
you know the the mobile market is moving
forward but it's just not you know
blowing people out of the water like it
used to be they're becoming less a
commodity and more device yet you know a
daily basis and you expect you know it's
not magical anymore it's functional um
the next one call calm posted their
quarterly revenue results and they made
6.1 billion dollars which is up
twenty-four percent year-over-year and
during that time frame during the last
quarter they shipped 173 million MSM
chips in the quarter the net income was
slightly down and the biggest part order
that is because of all the rd that
they've had to pour to accommodate all
the new network technologies that have
come out in the last especially like
combining cdma and LTE takes a lot of
work on their part but now that they've
gotten their radio technology pretty
much
to go for every major network technology
to come out in the next couple of years
then they're good to go LG had some
interesting earnings kind of mediocre
across the board but the smartphone
division is actually picking up a bit
bit their revenues went to two point
nine six billion which is like a 28.5
percent year-over-year increase the
operating profit is 122 million which is
about four times the previous year and
they hit their own milestone where they
ship 10.3 million smartphones which is a
record for them so did the nexus for
helpful model you know the nexus 4
definitely had a part in kind of picking
them up there a little bit and putting
some life into them Optimus G of those G
pro mm-hmm definitely so I know that
those are really the notable earnings
calls everyone else did you know as well
as expected when we talked about
Google's earnings uh the previous week
yeah yeah surprise surprise mobile
across the all the companies are you
know so so let's talk about routing
Roman Britain in ramen ramen noodles of
course sony released a OSP for the
Xperia Z on their own github it's worth
noting that most things are functional
but Sony can't release proprietary
binaries for the modem and camera to the
public so they'll have to be pulled from
other sources and basically they take
they technically can't be part of a osb
efforts because they are open source
code it's good news for the development
community if you have those devices see
some exciting stuff for that cyanogenmod
they're adding both time-delayed and
voice capture models to the camera
software currently the voice actions are
Sid whiskey and cheese kind of reminding
me of the galaxy s3 voice actions with
the camera and things like that remind
you as of that yeah I actually I talked
about this whenever it was first men
and I was very surprised at how many
people were said oh my galaxy note 2 can
do that or all my galaxy note 3 can do
or yeah yeah galaxy s3 can do that and
and I said yeah but that's TouchWiz and
not everybody likes TouchWiz and those
features aren't available on every other
device not every phone is a samsung
touchwiz device you know so it's for
people that run cyanogenmod that lost
that functionality on a newer TouchWiz
device or for anybody that doesn't have
it that's awesome you know that's great
you know that you can do timed photos in
remotely triggered photos by keywords
you know it not that not all those
features are available to everybody and
now the fact that most popular rom in
the world has it and a large list of
supported devices in a very large list
of supported devices it's going to bring
these features to a lot of people that
didn't have it so it's very cool and if
if my little guy here that keeps on
truckin ever gets cm cm 10.1 I will use
the hell out of those features from
someone that has a device that comes
with s voice pretty much the only useful
thing about s voice are the voice
commands because s voices come it's
garbage compared to google voice search
but you know s voice is a 30 megabyte
file versus some voice commands being
integrated into the software I'd really
like to see Samsung just focus on
putting voice commands where it's
necessary and not have this bloated
useless piece of software taking up
memory it's a better approach yeah angry
hey what so let's let's talk about some
apps alright so first of all I think the
biggest one here is swipe it basically
you know that keyboard that comes with a
lot of android devices um gives you the
option to change to it basically it
finally gets put into a beta application
in the Play Store available for 99 cents
they've needed this for a long time
they've needed to just like with what
Google did with calendar they you know
made the appt they made an appt for it
and not come in the operating system so
this is kind of a move like Google is
doing with their their main apps making
it into a nap and they've only been on
om partnership devices so it's not like
on everything and with the large amount
of other apps that are coming out for
keyboards you know they have to make a
presence and this will give them a good
way to update it as well as you know add
new features things like that another
beloved app of mine is airdroid and I
know a lot of people use this app and
it's very useful they just came out with
their new version it's a device free lab
so you sign in to the web and AirDroid
will launch automatically on the device
even when it's not nearby same network
free so you don't need a Wi-Fi network
connection to log in you can access
airdroid through different networks with
an AirDroid account that's kind of cool
some people think security it's a little
bit a but it's very nice you can access
your phone from anywhere you can find
your phone okay locate your device on a
map lock hit wipe it lock pop and drop
it what call notifications and initiate
a new call from your Android device
remote camera like that improved SMS
photo and file experience it's
definitely improved a lot of bug fixes
and improvements all in all a lot better
and I'm excited to see where it goes
from here
and then speaking of Kickstarter like I
was speaking about it earlier I don't
know how to pronounce it anybody know
how to pronounce that I think it's Mindy
on you you can butcher it will let you
minam minam okay so minam correct me if
I'm wrong any like a somebody spell it
out for me i spelled mi and um you um
basically they were a Kickstarter
campaign they were completely blown out
of the water the fundraiser started with
a goal of just ten thousand dollars and
ended today with the total of eighty
seven thousand three hundred sixty nine
dollars nearly nine hundred percent of
the original goal basically for those of
you guys who haven't seen the minim
keyboard project it's true create a
keyboard that is both effective and
typing in a small screen with small
screen real estate taking down the
keyboard rose just 21 it's kind of an
interesting concept what do you guys
think about the one line concept it's
interesting like I don't know how well
I'll be able to type on it but I do like
it because especially in landscape mode
you know you you can kind of go to
respond to like a comment and you kind
of forget your place because the you
know you're the count of the box that
you're typing in takes up the whole
screen were you looking at what you're
responding to on in portrait so you must
not even type anything worth mentioning
on landscape mode because you get once
one sentence in there and then it but
you know yeah it's in the buffer and you
can't see anything else like if you know
if you forget what you were saying if
you have a very long worthy Google+
comment to type out or an email you're
gonna be calling you you screwed like I
hate typing in landscape or if you truly
like one of those novel typers on your
phone which by the way I hate you um
this will not be the app for you
any other comments on this do we know
how to pronounce it yet nope minimally
minus zoom in you I why don't we just
call it the Kickstarter minimal keyboard
no there's probably another project
that's coming out soon it's gonna be
called that ah touche up there project a
little bit of a or shadow there okay so
uh facebook home you know this has been
a week or so since it's been out sees it
but procedure on half a million installs
however the question remains how many
people install it because they're
curious and they've you know seeing a
lot of things about it and then just
don't install it i would like what
adventure that that's a lot of people
because the play store doesn't track
that the Play Store tracks install is
not active installs yeah but and then
you have to if you want to track that
though how do you track an activex
install you know then you gotta go into
metrics for that and then it's it you
don't want to get into that cluster in
my opinion but it would be interesting
to see how many people uninstall it and
how long they had it on their phone I'm
sure I'm sure facebook has that metric
though oh you know they do oh yeah
Google might not buy facebook no they
definitely have that metric and I'm sure
Facebook doesn't want to share that
metric darn right like yes half a
million installs dammit 10,000 felpham
only kept it and they rated at one star
oh they raided it one star the one star
rating oh man okay I'm softkeys e it's
an application that lets you seamlessly
customize the on-screen navigation
buttons this works with any device that
has roots and busy box and soft keys
let's go Scott that this mate you know
this phone i have the HTC droid DNA hits
my favorite film I got a POS I alright
so if you're new to the show and new to
Derek Ross he hates this phone but he
still uses it
we don't know why he likes torture he
doesn't talk in the third person that
much so don't be scared right there so
late um although it's in twrp right now
yeah yeah wiki I saw you hadn't warp
earlier so so I don't like this film but
I I'm waiting for something better to
come along to make me happy you always
say so I'm still waiting Scott anyways
uh damn it now you made me lose my spot
profitable for talking about soft keys
oh I miss I miss soft keys I really do
if if I have on the nexus 4 still if I
didn't sell it or if I didn't get my
wife my galaxy nexus I would be using
that app right now and just I changed my
soft keys every day you know they that I
think it's awesome for people that have
soft keys I'm job little jealous you
would change your soft keys every day
you get you without me you would not yet
i used to for the first week i would and
then i would get tired of it then i
would stick with something pink unicorn
man dude yes I what are you talking

soft key that they're all going to be

hashtag pink unicorn screenshot hashtag
corn droid okay that not we touched on
this a little bit last episode but we do
some more information now google
launched an app called one today which
is support to support nonprofit
organizations that goal is to raise
awareness and highlight nonprofit
organizations in their work allowing
them to support the allowing you to
support them through giving one dollar
so every day a new project is
highlighted
the new opportunity to donate and it's
currently an invite-only like we said
last time and only on Android to test
the service and you'll need a Google
Wallet account to will not account but
you'll need Google Wallet to donate is
pretty interesting different thing a day
it it's a cool thing for them to do you
know I wonder no wait they can't use
that for tax purposes what it's good
that they are focusing on nonprofit
organizations and trying to kind of
chair pick the ones that really would
you prefer that I'll take the money and
just blow it somewhere you know would
you prefer them to come out with an app
that funds profit organizations like if
we have like Verizon on there hey here's
a tip that be funny all right so uh so
that's not gonna be made into it out by
the i would rate that one star if that
makes you feel you would not you would
download it you would use it all right
so let's move on to the to the meat of
the show the the device news and carry
your news well will lump all that
together we call this the t-bone of the
show the t-bone on the show was over so
the show is called the samsung galaxy s4
and the HTC One and instead of talk
spending the next half hour talking
about these two devices because it's
been beaten to your heads the past
couple days since the s4 became
available nearly everywhere for
pre-order and people are getting review
units we posted you know a versus video
something has some loved the one some
love the s4 and our man looky here
actually has the s4 on hand so instead
of going into insane amount of detail
I'm going to say I'm going to refer you
to our vs. videos our review videos and
our review posts um if you want to find
out more information but what I will
offer for our live viewers right now
while we talk about other device is if
you have any specific questions about
the s4 since Wookiee
one right now he's going to be more than
willing to answer anything you want to
know so go ahead and leave your ask four
questions in the comments and hit them
up here as we're talking about some
other news will give you a few minutes
to think of something good you know
besides you like it you know I asked you
know ask him ask him something hard and
complicated he's only had it for about a
day or so I would like to say something
just to kick this all off okay um first
I I've had a little more time to test
the s4 before when we saw in New York
you're right you're right well the other
thing is I would like to address this
right off the bat and I'm going to speak
right to the camera your samsung galaxy
note 2 is not better than the s4 stop
saying but it is not better that's it
it's nothing backed it up he just goes
out right and says it and he's starting
a flame war this is just that's crazy
you know I'm doing it here instead of
looky here looky knows what the hell
he's talking about so I would believe
him you know bigger isn't always better
you know mmm all right so why you're why
you're thinking what why you're coming
up with some some questions for wiki
here so t-mobile and MetroPCS officially
tie the knot and well they announced
they're officially tying the knot I
guess and it'll be made official come
May first here just in a few days so
what does that mean well we'll we'll
find out they're getting married there
they're going to be doing some things
and I'm sure next week we'll have all
sorts of information for you about the
the merger but it was approved and that
that's good there was some speculation
here when I'm when and if it was ever
going to happen but it was approved all
right so speaking of t mobile wash a
Washington state attorney general said
that that the fact that they're calling
themselves the uncarrier and there
running themselves as the uncarrier
that's a little misleading because they
actually are carrier so the Attorney
General's thinks that they were
deceptive and they duped some of their
customers so because t-mobile is an
awesome company they they're they're
green and they're going to clarify their
terms of service and if anybody was
duped into thinking that t-mobile wasn't
an actual carrier after all um you have
you can cancel your service with no
penalty if you signed up between March
26th and April 25th so during that month
time frame when they were uncarrier in
themselves all over the place if you got
duped into thinking they weren't the
carrier you can cancel your service and
there will be no cancellation penalty
and you'll get a full refund for the
device and the service provided so
that's very nice Aceves at Samsung
that's very nice of t-mobile to do them
um I don't have tmobile but I wasn't
duped or any did Jenny you guys think
they actually weren't a carrier no I was
really confused for a while there but
but I but um I think I got it I think I
got oh yeah I understood no clue
honestly yeah but whatever ok so moving
on moving on let's uh let's see if we
have any comments about how fast is the
GPS lock rookie I have no idea i haven't
had time to test it I'm sorry oh my god
is here right now all right so it's so
run outside you guys I'm gonna lock on
in your house yeah I don't think I can
test it right now um I'm gonna I'll try
okay so while you're seeing if your
house is impervious to GPS service I'm
what near a window but I don't think
it's going to work alright so do you
feel like a Jedi when you're using it
because of the air gestures no no okay
I'm sorry I would all right so so okay
uh how about a more important question
are any of the air gestures actually
useful have you have you used them as a
better question have you used them what
do you think of the air gestures um I've
used a few i mean the the hover like the
captain you know anything that when you
get near the screen kind of like the s
pen does with a note 2 or any other
device that uses the s pen stuff like
that is kind of handy but um for the
most part I think it's personally I
think it's a little giving I don't find
it all that handy but I haven't had that
much time to play around with it at home
when we tried it out in New York it was
really hard to get most things working
just because of all the crowds and noise
so that's where I had the most
experience with it I mean I've literally
been playing around with this thing a
little bit today because I would I got
it yesterday and I was working all day
yesterday and all day today and whenever
I've had the chance I've been trying to
mess around with this but uh I haven't
had a chance to really play with I
gestures or or whatever that hell they
call it or the air stuff but I like the
fact that it does know when you're near
it that's just a cool feeling ah alright
so we have another question should not
be laughed at like that all right so we
have another question here um will the
s4 get screen burn like the s3 well I'll
let us say he can't answer that question
because he only had it for a short
amount of time and screen burn you know
what would happen after excessive Hughes
and I'm betting you didn't you haven't
use it excessively yet now I'm trying
and you know it's and it's a it's it's
slightly updated you know two completely
different display
technology to so so we're you know who
knows what what lies in for the screen
i'm assuming samsung address some issues
on that but but uh you know we'll we'll
keep it on that good that is interesting
to know what i would like to say to just
real quick is that I'm really
disappointed that I don't get to play
around with Knox yet cuz that was the
one feature that had me we're looking I
was going to talk about that in a minute
damn it oh that's finest that's fine but
we'll get we'll get to that in a minute
now and I'll let you uh you can you can
yell about it as well with me so so uh
please explain the key differences
between the US version with a Snapdragon
in the international version with the
Exynos 5 well I'm gonna say that that's
pretty much that's pretty much the
difference so the Exynos 5 has eight
cores in it four of them only use at a
time it's it's a ARM architecture big
little so let's say you're running like
a really badass powerful program you're
going to have the four powerful course
running and then now you're sending a
text message you don't need the really
powerful cores run to that or maybe the
phone sitting idle it's not in use so
the little guys the low-power bigger
price martyr in a smaller power
generation processes are going to run so
you don't actually run 88 at a time it's
kind of a little marketing gimmick to
say it's eight core I mean don't get me
wrong it is a eight core we only ever
used for at a time um in the Snapdragon
600 duh well it's a Snapdragon 600 it's
it's one of two devices with it on the
market or will be on the market right
now with the cpu have the cpu on the
snapdragon benchmarks almost exactly as
well as the octa does with the bigger
course so it's not I don't know the
bathroom is set oh sorry no that's so we
have a bunch of questions you just want
to try to hammer mounts we're not here
all night so a wikia how how thin does
it feel compared to the s3 um it doesn't
feel all of that different I mean it
doesn't feel that much thinner but this
is something I noticed the first time I
ever used it it feels just sturdier
something about the s3 felt like I could
just kind of like crush it uh the s4
does not feel that way okay all right uh
you know it you know dinner but it has
more to do with the try to hold it up
C&amp;amp;C right so so some guy named Joe Hindy
uneven who he is he says his note 2 was
better than the s4 wiki and he says
you're wrong well I say uh he's wrong
but I don't know who he is so so yeah
joe hindy is a summit you're an
authority colleague of ours okay so we
have another question for you okey is
the unlocking lag glitched still there
on the s4 it was there on the s2 s3
whenever you would go to unlock it real
fast it would lag for a second before it
shows the home screen are you seeing any
lag when you go to unlock it before the
home screen comes up well there's an
animation um um see if you can see if we
can all right so I try to kind of see
there do it again a bit for those people
for those people watching or listening
wookies demonstrating the unlock right
now that time I went quick but the first
time it was definitely slower you know
but is it slow or is it just because the
animations point just the animation you
see ya oh oh ooh there's a real it's the
node 2 is really slow to wake but to
turn all the cores only get all the
process is done this I haven't ad off
that's so we have a question about
battery life and I'm not going to have
him answer this yet because you can't
tell battery life in a day so we'll get
back to that here in the future i love
to answer it but i can't yet is it laggy
ER than the HTC one I have not really
noticed that but at the same time I
spent a lot more time with the one then
i have with the s4 so far so I don't
want to say anything already okay
alright so I drew it early enters
walking we have a lot of questions man
okay all right so uh unlocking glitch I
got that one all right so have you used
it outside yet in sunlight I have not
okay sorry about that we will get back
to that really a guy the one to know
about the screen in the sunlight ok so
how steady do you have to hold it 24
crisps photo you guys know as well as I
do whenever you're taking pictures from
your smartphone if you don't have you
know neurosurgeon hands you no they're
blurry have you tried taking pictures
with it you know do you have to buy
right here and this is a great way to
try because it's low light so we'll see
minutes it's definitely going to look
grainy but we'll see if it's maybe
granny for low-light but yeah but you
know nice little hands on here alive
with Android 31 here chanson que that
actually looks fairly steady and I was
obvious you know you could tell I was
not doing a whole lot to stay steady man
I mean the there isn't really that kind
of double in did you get when you're
definitely movin ok all right what
anyway ok so what can your s4 do that my
note 2 can't ah be faster yeah oh and it
has to be faster it has newer hardware
better in an exact letter processor but
besides that beside speed I mean uh I
mean it does it does uh was going to say
the gestures but then I realized oh wait
a second you can do that pen gestures
you know what I want to show you one
more thing it can do that the note 2
cannot see how this looks normal won't
you shay alright so adjacent thank you
Jason's Minsky uh once he says I own the
HTC One and the Galaxy Note 2 i've owned
the entire galaxy phone line from one to
three and the note 2 plus the note 10.1
we all know TouchWiz has felt how it's
felt over the years a user experience
wise you know some people think it's
fella dated given all the updates and
what they have done how do you actually
feel when you use the new
s4 do you do you have that feeling that
Samsung you know did an awesome job you
like wow nice job samsung or you use it
and you're like oh it's just still
regular dated TouchWiz like isn't it an
updated touch was experience i think is
what we're getting at here arm the way
you asked it and the way the question
was phrased are very different it
definitely feels like an iteration of
tusk TouchWiz I mean it's definitely
TouchWiz it's not like going from HTC
Sense 4+2 to HTC Sense 5 or it's a
really different thing um it's clearly
TouchWiz it's faster talked with it's
less intrusive TouchWiz but it's still
TouchWiz and TouchWiz is in my opinion
just slow and laggy so you throw more
more processing power at it it's going
to speed up it you know would you agree
with that yeah I definitely agree with
that all right all right so okay Jason
hope that answered your question um yeah
wow we all done is there any new ones do
do do so you get a GPS lock or what no I
did I ass over and over okay all right
so i think that's if we missed your
question I'd apologize there's a bunch
of them we have some more news to talk
about so what I want you to do is go
ahead and check out our YouTube channel
there's a full review up vs video on
there and as well as android authority
com has tons of s for information and
wiki what's are you going to be doing
anything interesting with the s4 and in
the future that our users and viewers
should watch out for on yes I will I'm
going to be working on a video actually
starting tonight but I'm not going to
say what it is I hope you're not already
apparent your you got do that teaser
okay teaser wiki's gonna do something
awesome and video function in video form
in video form yeah so get ready guys ok
so moving on here so let's talk about
some carrier stuff here yeah we just
galaxy s4 doll things let's talk about
carrier news for a second
reisen they you know that they're
definitely not the uncarrier but they do
have a new device payment plan which is
not really a new device payment plans
been around for tablets i guess but but
they anyways so the revised the vice
payment plan allows you to basically
subsidize a phone I'm sorry that's the
wrong word subsidize it allows you to
set up a payment plan for a for a phone
over the course of a year has a two
dollar finance charge you got to pay
twenty four dollars to do it but in in
the the only stipulation is is you pay
it off in a year and the phone has to
cost at least 350 bucks so you go to buy
that new acts for off contract let's say
it's 700 bucks you can spread at seven
hundred bucks out over 12 payments not
bad so you know what you so what I'm
envisioning doing is selling your phone
on likes wapa which is a great service
by the way or you been getting you know
your 100 200 bucks for it putting that
is like a down payment to reduce your
monthly payment on your new kind of
subsidized you know device payment plan
and there you go you get a new you get a
new phone every year um so speaking of
the galaxy s4 and Verizon the pre-order
page went live today and device ships
next month May thirtieth which is a full
month after every other carrier gets
theirs but you know cdma radios are
tough so those are that and Verizon just
wants to make you suffer word analysis
Chris what's that as I have a more for
your side I'm another thing to just
think that their customers are gluttons
for punishment lookie what carrier is
the s4 on that you have arm or will it
be on our will and won't be on a carrier
this is kind of odd I know where the
device came from yeah arm it came with
no sim card so you're just going to do
what you're not gonna do like call
testing on yours can do Wi-Fi well I
mean it's
I'm good it's a gsm phone so i can use
any gsm sim okay all right all right so
let's stop talking about some some
carrier stuff here and let's talk about
some other news a sous cube Google TV
device is now available four hundred and
forty bucks we saw that back at CES it
it's a completely skin and unique google
TV experience the box looks like a cube
so the you i had to look like a cube as
well because you couldn't have one
without the other apparently it's a
completely unique 3d cube launcher so
you know it's interesting um if I was a
betting man I would wait a month because
Google i/o is you know a few weeks away
but if you have to have something 3d in
Cuba shand squarish yeah it's a now
available MLG promises a smartphone with
a flexible Oh LED display this year in
their earnings call so sometime before
the end of the year which could be you
know December but sometime before the
end of the year they're gonna have a
flexible display phone they said it will
come in fourth quarter so that's yeah
that's interesting what you guys think
about that a phone with a flexible
display from LG know if I like it I
think I don't think it'd be best
implemented in phones I think that many
other different types of things that can
be implemented into ah but phones not so
much that's my personal opinion is
haven't agreed I mean the only thing it
would be useful for is if you not so
much curved it but the technology would
allow it to be less breakable that's the
only advantage I have to me I think but
then you have to worry about whether
it's going to flex why you're actually
using the phone if it's that you know
less rigid elaborating what John said if
the flexible phone allows it to not
crack or break I will buy one in a
heartbeat and I will you know negate
everything
every bad thing that I said about it
because you know if you have a phone
that is going to be you know unbreakable
by dropping that's awesome mm-hmm um you
know I kind of said we would talk about
it when we were talking about other
developer before we went to other
talking about other devices but I got
cut up and over questions and forgot to
mention it Samsung Knox let's backtrack
a little bit for those really don't know
what Samsung Knox is it simply put its
platform security um it does trust zone
secure secure boot and it uses a Linux
Android selinux SC access controls for
the the colonel so it's the first
commercial device to ship that uses
android SE and then that's cool um it
basically the the simplest explanation
is is that it allows you to separate
your normal Android apps and you know
android framework and all that other
cool stuff that you're doing on a
personal level and allows it to put it
and it puts a special container around
your your business apps yours you know
your integrity management your VPN your
you know whatever single sign-on your
business stuff so it's this is Knox is
something for businesses knox's is what
Samsung would go to a business and say
hey look we have the security platform
and we're the only people to have it we
are good for business you use us in the
enterprise because we can secure your
devices and in an age where everybody is
bring your own device because it's
cheaper that way for enterprises to do
bring your own device I'll have to buy
everybody a separate phone and nobody
wants to carry two phones or two tablets
so we're in the age of BYOD so Knox is
great i'm looking forward forward to the
reviews of Knox I was hoping what kila
would be able to do that here but
apparently it's not going to be
available in to adjust
lie so what do you think about that
walkie well I'm also disappointed that I
will be able to check that out um at the
same time I don't know that that's
something I necessarily want to be in
the hands of one specific software
company but on the other hand just the
fact that somebody's doing it and the
fact that it's based on basically
selinux is going to encourage other
people to do the same thing and that's
going to start to bring Android into
being a more business friendly or
Enterprise friendly sort of operating
system for tablets or phones or whatever
in the future and that's something I
definitely want to see more of so I'm
excited to see where that goes even
though I'm still bummed out that I won't
get to play with Knox immediately and
see what it's going to do all right so
let's talk about one more device here
and then we'll move on for you run out
of time um so HTC this is a pretty cool
HTC's unlocked one model offers an LTE
device that works on AT&amp;amp;T but it's not
sold through AT&amp;amp;T that's something that
has never been done before you know
you've never been able to buy an LTE
device without it coming from the
carrier so that's got some support well
it except for you know the nexus 4 which
unofficially supports some places with
the LTE but when I can talk about that
because I really shouldn't even that
shouldn't be happening so this is a HTC
what the one is on something nobody else
does not do yet that's cool that means
that you can buy the unlock device using
on AT&amp;amp;T you don't have to worry about
carrier crap you don't have to worry
about all their crap and their branding
you can just you know that's awesome
then you can use LTE because normally
you know you just in the past you get
stuck with the hspa+ so that's cool oh
no let's talk or a big either it comes
straight from eccie yeah you have to
wait for them exactly since they're not
you know branding it you don't have to
wait for software updates to come from
them you get them drink directly from
HTC which is should mean faster up to
speaking of updates uh last this past
week was jelly bean all the things you
know because it's been out since last
june july so you know it's been out for
20 21 months or so so we might as well
that's two years um yeah um nine months
so let's uh let's start you know
updating it now the motorola Photon Q on
sprint got some jelly bean action which
is great because now these guys can use
google now and the better voice search
and you get some butter you know so
speaking of HTC in the 1s it I hate that
name anyway so the one ass on it on
tmobile finally got jelly bean Sony is
getting it ready for the Xperia P the go
in the xperia e dual the galaxy s relay
on t-mobile's getting jelly bean
t-mobile LG optimus l9 the verizon LG
spectrum too so yeah we got all sorts of
jelly bean and that's great because it's
been available on AOSP since you know
June dando June last year july yeah so
yeah might as well updated it's only
going on a year oh verizon also updated
the resound and no jelly bean though so
uh so we have any patent wars Dan's not
here Dan's usually our patent war King
Dan likes to be angry and hate on
everybody throwing around patents the
Dan isn't here so John is going to be
Dan yeah the there's really only one big
thing this week there was a big
injunction not really against HTC it was
between Nokia and STMicroelectronics and
STM basically sold HTC the microphones
for the for the one and ACC basically
released a statement clarifying because
the media just
ran rampant with the information as if
it's gonna you know result in some kind
of HTC ban like last year saw basically
the court rule was there might be an
infringement on on stmicroelectronics
part however HTC's blameless on the
matter and it's all on
stmicroelectronics to solve nokia has
not obtained any of junctions any
anywhere on the HTC HTC One itself in
any country HTC themselves were not
viewed by Nokia judgment against STM
Stacy's HTC can continue to sell the one
with the microphones that they've
already purchased because they were
purchased in good faith and you know
beyond the HTC simply going to
transition to an improved microphone
design once they ruin of their own
current inventory so uh you know
stmicroelectronics I'm sure is going to
get the hammer dropped on them but it's
a pretty seamless transition for HTC and
it's not going to affect their supply
any ok now that wraps it up so Scott if
