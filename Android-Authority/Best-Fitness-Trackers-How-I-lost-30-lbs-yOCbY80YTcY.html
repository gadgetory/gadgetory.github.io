this losing over 30 pounds in six months
well my activity tracker was a big help
now it's not a panacea it's not going to
suddenly make losing all that weight in
six months easy because it was a bugger
but for the right person it can be a
valuable tool so I gotta be honest with
you guys and tell you that I've actually
gained a little bit of weight since I
was out my lowest I went from 231 to 199
of my lowest and now about 206 207
although goes up and down to pounds or
so each week but the activity tracker I
have the garmin vivoactive HR was a big
help now this thing is a beast a year
ago it was sort of that near the top of
the line and it does a little bit of
everything and I got this one because it
was waterproof I wanted to go swimming
so means one of those activities that I
like doing and it's not boring but I
actually never went swimming with it I
hiked and walked a lot I went also on my
stationary bike I have like a bike
that's a desk right so I can put my
laptop on it and work or watch Game of
Thrones and an hour of cycling goes by
much much faster it really breaks up the
monotony I also did lots of compound
exercises squat dips
pull-up squat thrusts all that kind of
stuff that was really hard to keep going
I also go kayaking I do kayak fishing
I'm also getting a hunting dog a new
puppy and I expect that that is going to
help motivate me to get out and get
active because otherwise that puppy's
going to drive us crazy it's a very very
active dog so I'm hoping that helps me
because motivation is a big big factor
and this helped me stay motivated
because you would work hard each day and
even for a week maybe and not see any
results that's just the reality
but this here would give me some numbers
let me track how many calories are
burned that day what did I accomplish
that day what was my heart rate at what
my distance is all that kind of stuff
it's fairly accurate and it you know
transferred that data to your phone or
you turn
up top and you can sort of attract it
and gamify it gives you an emotional
payoff knowing that hey you know I
accomplished this today I may not see it
on the scale but in ten days two weeks
you will see that payoff in that respect
it helps it doesn't make it any easier
that's the reality okay
and I probably could have got something
a lot cheaper and had the same effect so
let's talk about what some options out
there for activity trackers for you
really the best fitness tracker you can
buy right now is the garmin vivosmart HR
plus it's one of the most featured
packed well rounded wearables you can
find for starters it has a big screen
display that's easy to read outdoors and
thanks to the large screen that means
you'll be able to view more information
on the tracker itself without having to
pick through your phone to open the
garment app it's also waterproof rated
up to 50 meters which is a feature many
trackers don't offer so how does it
differ from our previous fitness
tracking champion the vivosmart HR well
for starters it comes with built-in GPS
while remaining just about the same size
as its predecessor the addition of a GPS
brings home new running features like
personal records visual pacing auto
pause auto lap and walk run mode it's
also tracking your activity and workouts
automatically with Garmin's powerful
move IQ technology something that vivos
smart HR does not offer
now the vivosmart HR has been around for
a few months but it just recently
dropped 50 bucks in price that brings
the grand total to around 150 dollars
which is an absolute steal for what
you're getting with built-in GPS greater
water resistance rating automatic
activity recognition and the company's
wonderful Auto gol feature the Revo
smart HR plus is by far the best fitness
tracker available in this price range
the next stop on our list is the Fitbit
charge - it's clear Fitbit really
focused on design when making the charge
to this device not only looks more like
a piece of jewelry and less like a
standard fitness tracker this time round
which will also have the option to
change out the bands that you'd like the
charge to also has a bigger display this
time meaning you'll get more room for
smart phone notifications Plus Fitbit
also introduced a few new features to
the charge - that should help users stay
healthy and
relaxed overtime cardio fitness level
which will give you a cardiovascular
rating based on an estimate of your vo2
Max and relax a new on device guided
breathing feature that will walk you
through a short breathing exercise to
help you lower blood pressure reduce
stress and lessen anxiety now this could
be a great option for you because it is
also around $150 price range but another
factor that I liked when I had a Fitbit
is the Fitbit community now both devices
have a community surrounding them but a
lot of my friends are on a Fitbit and
they love to compete and and tease and
encourage each other within the Fitbit
community
so you really want to take that into
account the next up is the Fitbit Alta
HR 2016 Fitbit Alta has been one of our
favorite fitness trackers since launch
mainly due to the sleek stylish design
that many other fit big devices lacked
but what if you're looking for a device
similar to the Alta but can't go without
a heart rate sensor well you want to
check out the Fitbit Alta HR the
company's slimmest activity tracker with
a heart rate monitor the new Alta HR
brings the company's own pulse heart
rate technology to a slimmer form factor
fit that supposedly developed a new clip
for the Alta HR that reduced the size
and number of components needed allowing
for 25% slimmer design than the charge -
with a built-in heart rate sensor you'll
be able to better track your calories
burned non-death exercises like yoga and
spinning and also see real-time heart
rate zones on your wrist having a heart
rate sensor on your activity tracker
really does make a world of difference
alongside the Alta HR Fitbit also
introduced two new sleeping features
sleep stages and sleep insights sleep
stages utilizes the heart rate sensor to
estimate the amount of time you'll spend
in light deep and REM sleep as well as
the time you spend awake each night
sleep insights on the other hand uses
all the data in your Fitbit collects to
provide personalized guidance on how
better to improve your sleep if you're
interested in learning more about sleep
stages read the article now let's talk
about what is arguably the best
multi-sport activity tracker and that's
this one right here the garmin
vivoactive HR for starters it will track
your daily activity whether you're
running
cycling swimming or walking all thanks
to the built-in GPS of course it also
has an optical heart rate monitor that
will help you keep tabs on your resting
and active heart rate so I can speak a
little bit more about this device
because I've owned it and worn it for
over a year now and used it pretty much
everyday it's very good I don't know
what more I could want from a device
this does pretty much everything and it
does it reasonably well some complaints
that I would have about it is that it's
just too much for what I actually needed
it I bought it because it was a
multi-sport device right it would track
swimming running hiking cycling
stationary and road cycling the whole
bit but in reality I really just used it
for walking and hiking now when I was on
my stationary bike it does track your
heart rate and has a dedicated mode for
stationary bikes but I am suspicious
that it was accurately tracking my heart
rate it doesn't have a chest rate
monitor it has the optical heart rate
monitor but I am not completely
confident that it accurately tracked
that so oftentimes I would just manually
input my my distance and time but I was
on the stationary cycle in my lucid app
lucid app was the app that I was often
using and this didn't directly sync with
the lucid app it linked with the Nike
app or my fitness app and that app would
then link or sync with the lucid app so
that was another drawback to it but it's
very good I just think I could have
spent less like this was a lot more this
is like 360 Canadian when I bought it a
year ago it's like 150 180 now so very
good but overkill for everyone but the
most dedicated at leat so take that for
what it's worth
meet Jeremy shoemaker otherwise known as
shoe money and he became famous for this
photo where he showed off a cheque that
he made from Google Adsense and he's
become so good at making online
businesses that he made an announcement
that he does not start a new business
unless he can secure the businesses name
