affordable devices with premium like
features now there's one more throwing
its hat into the ring the real me one
real me is a sub brand of Oppo and this
handset is the result of a partnership
with Amazon India where the phone is
launching exclusively well we don't know
the official price yet is expected to
cost around seventeen thousand nine
hundred and ninety rupees which is
roughly equivalent to one hundred and
ninety five pounds here in the UK or two
hundred and sixty six US dollars and for
that you're getting an interesting to
those features whilst also facing some
compromises the first thing you'll
notice is the diamond black finish it's
a glossy finish that reflects light in a
kind of polygonal pattern this looks a
lot more impressive in press photos than
in the flesh to be honest and at first I
thought and hoped it would be textured
in some way that have been really
different and unique in reality though
it's just a trick of the light they'll
often go unnoticed especially under the
provided case you could easily achieve a
very similar effect with a sticker or
something else like that still it's nice
to see a budget phone trying something a
little bit different to be honest though
the phone generally feels quite cheaply
made very plasticy and light and not in
the good way
in fact at first when I opened it out
the box I had to double check that the
battery was actually in it I was also
pretty disappointed to discover a
microUSB port down the bottom that
definitely feels like a cheap choice
these days as do the haptics which come
from a very noisy and clumsy motor and
there's no fingerprint sensor which is
also something you always always find on
even budget handsets better news though
is the six inch to 160 by 1080p screen
with some very slim bezels some of the
early official photo showed a notch but
it seems that this design feature was
dropped last minute as mine has a
regular looking screen that's going to
be good news for some but it would have
been interesting to see a notch on a
device this cheap there's a single
speaker down the bottom but it's
actually pretty loud as they go that
microUSB and generally cheap feel had me
set up to not expect much when I first
booted up the device I was pleasantly
surprised during setup then to discover
the option for face unlock this would be
the result of the Helio P 60 processor
with its built-in NPU neural processing
unit and of course it's somewhat
mitigates the lack of fingerprint sensor
though not quite and that AI prowess
should also help to extend
three thousand four hundred and ten
million power battery which operators
will last fifteen hours six agreed
gobitis of ram is also generous choice
for a budget handset as is 128 gigabytes
of internal storage and then there's the
hybrid SIM tray which will be useful
either for using dual SIM cards of
course or expanding that memory and on
the whole performance seems perfectly
adequate the Helio P 60 is roughly
equivalent to the snapdragon 616 in that
regard and the 12 nanometer production
may help to contribute to the superior
battery efficiency that said the chipset
features a lesser GPU in the Mallee g7 2
MP 3 you may notice the odd dropped
frame in demanding games but nothing
major I'll be testing that out myself in
the full review of course the real me
one is running Android 8.1 Oreo with the
color OS UI layer on top I can't say I'm
a fan but that's a matter of personal
taste and again things seem to breeze by
with nary a stutter the camera also
seems to be above par for the price
point and once again gets to join in
with the AI phone around the back is a
13 megapixel shooter while the front
gets a decent 8 megapixel both are
capable of portrait modes depth of field
effects as well as an AI beauty
technology both of these are handled by
the NP you despite the single lens in my
very brief test so far the camera
performance seems pretty decent but I'm
gonna need a bit longer to give it a
final verdict so this is a phone that
very much feels like a budget device it
feels it and it looks it despite real
Me's best efforts with that weird back
panel but there are also some cool
features here that largely come down to
the AI and at such a low price point
this might just be enough to convince
some punters of course I let you know
how the device performs in much more
detail as well as going into what it's
like to use on a day to day basis in the
full review so stay tuned for that if
