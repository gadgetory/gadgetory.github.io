at the very beginning of this review the
wall EP 30 Pro is a while a mate 20 Pro
Plus and that's not out of the ordinary
usually the huawei mate series upgrades
the SOC adds a bunch of gizmos and
features but what the wall EP series is
really about is taking all the awesome
parts of the mate series and adding a
really really stellar camera system when
I say that Huawei p30 Pro is a mate 20
Pro I'm not kidding it still has the
same cure 980 SOC it still has all that
same storage and RAM it's got the in
screen fingerprint reader the 40 watt
charging reverse wireless charging
you're getting all the same features
that you get in the huawei mate 20 Pro
in the Huawei P 30 Pro in this really
nice fashion forward body and a body
that really really focuses on the
cameras and when I say this phone
focuses on the cameras oh gosh do I mean
it there is so much to unpack here first
and probably foremost you're still
getting that 40 megapixel camera that it
was in the Huawei P 20 Pro and the mate
20 pro but probably the biggest change
here is actually a difference to the
actual camera array so a regular camera
system you've got one red to green in a
blue pixel that makes up this bear or a
filter sensor and that basically
interprets light and turns it into color
no always done here is completely
redefined what it means to take in
colour with one red to yellow and one
blue sensor now the reason they've done
this is because in the Huawei p20 Pro
they've had a monochrome sensor that was
able to take in more detail and apply
that to the image and the results were
amazing but what you're getting here is
in that yellow sensor you actually get
more information that you would get from
a normal green sensor it captures extra
red data and then kind of interprets all
the information into color and gives you
the extra detail that you would normally
get from something like a monochrome
sensor and there's also pretty amazing
there is a crazy amount of detail in
these images and part of that's because
of that 40 megapixel sensor and by
default the phone is actually set to a
10 megapixel result image which pretty
much is able to take groups of four
pixels and bring them into one super
pixel which takes in way more light data
in combination with the ryb sensor
you're just getting a ton of light
information that you normally wouldn't
get in a smartphone camera so the other
major change in the Huawei p30 Pros
camera is this new periscope 5x optical
zoom you've probably heard a lot about
it basically what they're doing is
taking a little prism mechanism and
putting it inside of the camera sensor
and that way they're able to reflect the
light at about 90 degrees so they can
actually flip the camera sensor 90
degrees and fit it inside the phone it's
pretty amazing technology and it works
extremely well now this is optical zoom
so theoretically you shouldn't really be
losing any quality and when you switch
to the 5x optical mode it looks clear as
day it honestly looks as if you're using
the One X zoom because it is true
optical zoom now there's also a 10x ai
slash optical mode which basically super
samples those 5x zoom and then has
additional information on the edges and
it looks equally amazing honestly if you
needed to use your phone for 10x zoom
and still want to get a crystal-clear
image this is kind of the phone you're
gonna have to get to get that result now
there's also a 50x zoom mode but you
probably don't want to use that unless
you really need to read information
super far away but it is really cool to
have a phone that you can basically use
as a telescope now like pretty much any
Huawei phone it does suffer a little bit
from overexposure but if you drag the
exposure down on any individual image
you just get a ton of detail and if
you've been on Android or 30.com or
Twitter in the last few days you've
probably seen the absolutely outrageous
amount of low-light photos that have
been posted using this phone and I'll
say it right now this is the best
low-light camera on the market today in
a smart phone you can compete this
head-to-head against Google pixels
nitesite and it's it's better I don't
know what to say it's just better the
noise is lower it just brings up the
images as if there is light in the scene
I took these photos in a crazy darkroom
in a crazy dark scene outside and it
looks like they were taken during the
day it's just ridiculous
Wow Wow this applies to video as well
there's almost no noise seen in these
really really low light situations in
video and if you're a very heavy video
user on your smartphone this is gonna be
the phone to beat for that as well so
one aspect do huawei p30 Pro that I was
really really surprised about is the
amazing video stabilization now I don't
talk about video a lot in my reviews but
as you can see this is being shot on a
huawei P 30 Pro right now and it is
extremely smooth it basically feels like
it's on a gimbal which is just insane
I think it's using the wide camera and
then cropping in and just using a
combination of OS in me is but as you
can see like the lighting is really good
the exposure is good on my face it's
good on the background and it really
evens out the highlights in the shadows
to produce a really nice image that is
extremely stable
so besides that 5x optical zoom lens and
that standard 40 megapixel lens you've
also got a wide-angle lens and it's not
quite as wide as the samsung galaxy s 10
plus it is still decently wide and it's
really nice to have that ability to have
those kind of shots but if you want
something crazy crazy wide you're gonna
have to go for the samsung galaxy s 10
they also got a time-of-flight sensor in
the back of this phone which helps with
things like portrait mode the portrait
mode on this phone still isn't quite as
good as Google's pixel portrait mode but
it is quite a bit better than a lot of
other phones we've seen so far you can
also use portrait mode in video now
which is something that I've been
waiting to see for a while you've also
got a crazy high resolution selfie
camera in this phone that shows a ton of
detail and I really like the color
processing in it although I'm not really
sure I want to see that much detail in
my face but honestly the more megapixels
the better I definitely would have liked
to see a hole-punch style display in
this phone just like we saw in the
galaxy s 10 it is using a water drop
notch displayed just kind of like we've
seen in pretty much every 20:18 phone so
that just feels a tiny bit outdated but
that's honestly personal preference as
far as power and processing goes this
phone is really amazing it's pretty much
exactly the same as the well way mate xx
pro because still using that same cure
980 chip this phone does have a slightly
bigger battery than the huawei mate 20
pro and the Samsung Galaxy S 10 but it's
battery life is just amazing I got about
10 hours of screen on time on this phone
which is absolutely insane I'm not sure
that I've gotten 10 hours of screen on
time in my first run on any phone
ever and I know that a lot of people
don't really like screen on time as a
metric of battery percentage so I'll put
this into perspective
I took my phone off the charger at about
9:00 a.m. used it all day I'm relatively
heavy user stay up until 4:00 a.m. just
like browsing Reddit and Instagram and
all that stuff because I couldn't fall
asleep went to bed woke up in the
morning use the phone until about noon
or 1:00 and finally got it to 5% so I
could take that screen shot and that is
pretty much true to day battery life I
don't think that I've seen a phone that
has actually enabled true true to day
battery life where I could use it for
two straight days without it dying but
the huawei p30 Pro really checks that
box the other absolutely amazing thing
is the 40 watt super charge that this
phone has available to it when this
phone got to 5% I put it on the super
charger got in the shower to take a
shower and when I got out it was at like
65 or 70 percent and that's just unreal
like the ability to charge your phone up
to 70% while you're in the shower after
it gets down to 5% after two days you
pretty much not gonna have to worry
about battery life in your phone anymore
and if you were hoping for a slightly
smaller phone while wait has you covered
there as well they've also got the
Huawei p30 which is a smaller phone it's
got a headphone jack the only thing that
it doesn't have is the prism 5x optical
zoom
it's a 3x optical zoom but it actually
does better at three times then the
Huawei p30 pro because it's actually
optical at 3x where the p30 pro is only
optical at 5x so if you're like 99% of
the other consumers on this planet you
probably mostly care about the camera
and the battery life and honestly the
wall-e p30 pro feels like the phone to
beat in 2019 so far in both of these
aspects it's got an absolutely stellar
camera system which can see in the dark
I don't think I've seen any phone that
can do low-light performance as well as
the Huawei p3 Pro and the fact that you
can charge this thing up in just a few
minutes and it will last a full two days
is absolutely insane it's definitely one
of my favorite phones of the year so far
we'll see if something else G crowns it
but until next time I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
