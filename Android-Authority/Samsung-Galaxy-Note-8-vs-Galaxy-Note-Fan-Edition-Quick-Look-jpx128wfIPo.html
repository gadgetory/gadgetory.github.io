and we're taking a quick look at the
brand new Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and
comparing it to the Galaxy Note fan
edition to give you the best
representation of what's new what's
different and what's better on this
year's model over the fan Edition which
is technically last year's model kicking
things off with the design the note 8
and fan Edition features your typical
Samsung design with glass on the front
and back and a metal frame wrapping
around the sides both are IP 68
certified and the only difference here
is the note is much more Square and
angular versus the fan Edition which has
a rounder body otherwise they feel very
similar in the hand but the note 8 is a
little more grippy with a sharper body
line the note 8 has a larger 6.3 inch
screen over the 5.7 inch of the fan
Edition but both are vibrant and
contrasting with the Super AMOLED
technology and have quad HD resolutions
but the note 8 has more pixels because
of the 18 and a half by 9 aspect ratio
you would think the over half an inch
increase in screen size would make the
note 8 a lot bigger but because of the
taller and narrower screen and the super
thin bezels of the note 8 the two phones
are practically the same width wise and
the only real difference is the note 8
is a little bit taller the Galaxy Note
fan Edition is the last galaxy device to
feature a front-facing fingerprint
sensor but with the thinner bezels of
the note 8 this means that Samsung had
to move the fingerprint sensor to the
back unfortunately it's still in the
same awkward place next to the camera as
it was on the s8 but you still have
other secure unlocking methods like the
iris scanner and facial recognition as
an alternative from a technical
standpoint not a whole lot has changed
with the s-pen from the fan addition to
the note 8 it still has the same
clickable top the same ballpoint tip and
the only real change that Samstag is
made with the s-pen is through the
software the screen off memo has been
improved to make them easier to edit and
now supports up to a hundred pages of
notes there's also a new live messaging
feature that lets you send custom gifs
or gifts that you wrote or drew and it's
pretty fun to use the rest of the
software experience is pretty identical
you've got Samsung software experience
on top of Android nougat and both
features Samsung's AI assistant called
vixx B but the difference is you have
the dedicated Bigsby button on the note
8
which you don't get on the fan edition
what the camera Samsung's made a pretty
drastic change from the fan edition to
the note 8 the fan edition comes with a
standard single 12 megapixel sensor at F
1.7 and optical image stabilization
which is proven to take some fantastic
photos and still is a great camera to
have in 2017 over on the note 8 Samsung
has doubled down on the cameras with two
12 megapixel sensors optical image
stabilization on both lenses and gives
you the ability to optically zoom in by
2x and do interesting depth effects so
you can alter after the fact
inside the note 8 features the
snapdragon 835 processor and bumps up
the ram to 6 gigabytes which is a huge
jump from the 4 gigabytes of RAM on the
fan addition the fan Edition also comes
with Samsung's own Exynos 88-90 with no
Snapdragon counterpart since this was
not released in the States the battery
capacity on the note 8 is a 3300
milliamp hour battery which is only
marginally larger than the 3200 milliamp
hour battery on the fan Edition it's
pretty clear that Samsung is still
playing it safe after what happened last
year so let's hope that Samsung has done
some software trickery to help with the
battery life on the note 8 because 3300
milliamp hours doesn't sound all that
comforting on a phone with huge specs
and a massive 6.3 inch screen but what
do you guys think of the Galaxy Note 8
and how it compares to the famishing
do you think Samsung has made enough
changes or do you think they could have
done more let us know down in the
