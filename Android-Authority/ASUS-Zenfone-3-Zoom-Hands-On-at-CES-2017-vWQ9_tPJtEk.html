authority and we're here at CES 2017
taking a look at the zenfone 3 zoom this
is the successor to last year zenfone
zoom which had a large and somewhat
bulky optical zoom lens attached to the
back the zenfone 3 zoom swaps all of
that out for a dual lens camera setup
which is something women seeing a lot of
on very many smartphones and it's
implementation is very similar to how
Apple uses dual lens system on the
iPhone 7 plus you've got two 12
megapixel cameras on the back with an
aperture of f11 and a 25 millimeter
focal length on the main lens and a 59
millimeter focal length on the secondary
sensor for a 2.3 times optical zoom the
camera is capable of going up to 12
times zoom but anything beyond the 2.3
optical zoom is completely digital the
camera also comes with a new auto
focusing system that suze calls Tritech
plus that combines laser autofocus
subject tracking and dual pixel phase
detection autofocus for an extremely
fast focusing speed of just point zero
three seconds the front camera is also
pretty impressive coming in at 13
megapixels and F 2.0 aperture so it
should work pretty well especially if
you're into taking selfies the design of
the phone also looks a lot like apples
is a full metal body that's mostly flat
with rounded corners and sides but
unlike the iPhone the zenfone 3 zoom
does come with a headphone jack which is
on the bottom and alongside that is the
USB type-c port and a speaker it comes
in at just seven point nine nine
millimeters thick so just a hair under 8
millimeters which is impressively thin
especially considering that the battery
inside this thing comes in at a whopping
five thousand milliamp hours so it
should last a very long time on a single
charge and as soon as this phone quoted
to last for 42 days on standby as far as
the rest of the specs go you've got a
fingerprint sensor on the back a 5.5
inch AMOLED 1080p screen which did look
quite good for a 1080p AMOLED panel and
on the inside it's being powered by a
Snapdragon 625 and four gigabytes of RAM
the software is Android 6.0 marshmallow
currently with the Seuss's and UI so
it's a pretty similar experience if not
completely identical to what we saw on
the regular zenfone 3 lineup and as Sue
says it'll be available starting this
February as for pricing and what regions
it will be hitting in the month of
February that is still to be confirmed
but we definitely keep you posted as we
find out more within the coming weeks
so keep it tuned here to the Android
Authority YouTube channel and the
website at Android 30.com for more on
the zenfone 3 zoom and the rest of our
CES 2017 coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
