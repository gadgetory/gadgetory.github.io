phones as revered as the Nexus 5 for an
affordable price you can get up-to-date
software in a simplistic but attractive
body but here comes a new challenger the
oneplus one that hopes to take that
crown by quite literally being bigger in
every way except for the price but how
did they actually fare when stacked up
against one another well let's find out
because it's Josh McCown from Android
authority what's going on everybody
and this is the oneplus one versus the
Nexus 5 as far as design goes you
couldn't really be looking at two more
different devices
the first glaring difference between
these two deals with size as the oneplus
one towers over the Nexus 5 by having a
screen almost half an inch larger while
five-inch screen devices have been the
norm the move toward larger devices has
begun to overshadow the standard when
the Nexus 5 was first released we loved
the more minimalistic design choices
that included a soft touch back and its
own design quirk of having the Nexus
logo sideways but other than that we
have a comfortable feeling phone with a
typical button layout and otherwise very
few thrills on the other hand the larger
1+1 sports a little more flair with a
silver lining around the front panel
that also has capacitive buttons which
don't have to be used and around the
back of this particular version is the
samstone black material that is akin to
a soft feeling sandpaper and ultimately
provides quite a bit of grip the
what-you-see-is-what-you-get motif of
the Nexus 5 is not found on the oneplus
one as the back cover of the one can be
replaced
for example a bamboo backing is already
spotted on the oneplus website now when
what is underneath the hood seems to
matter more with these two phones we
thus find a similar story either way
when it comes to design but we do have
to factor in the size difference the
Nexus 5 is a very easy phone to handle
especially when you compare it to the
large oneplus one which does get some
credit for not being impossible to use
in one hand though the 5.5 inch screen
size is probably the limit of comfort
for the general user that same general
user might end up going for the small
device more often than not anyway the
Nexus 5 might be simplistic but it
doesn't feel like being unique the
oneplus one does think outside the box a
little bit and its overall larger flare
results in an attractive body all-around
to light up the displays and we have no
choice but to factor in the size once
again
Nexus 5 screen is a now common five inch
IPS performer compared to the 5.5 inch
LTPS panel of the oneplus one it's
pretty obvious what the advantages and
disadvantages are larger screens allow
for a more enjoyable media experience
whether it be with video games or even
text in website viewing but the Nexus
5's smaller stature does definitely
doesn't detract from its good experience
five inches is plenty for users out
there and as we mentioned before it is
by far the easier size to handle in one
hand and as far as quality goes both of
these displays provide very similar and
very good experiences with great viewing
angles and similar color production
while the pixel density of the oneplus
wayne's a little by virtue of the larger
screen it isn't a difference that is at
all easy to spot it comes down to
whether or not you want the larger
screen but I've had a good time on
either of these phones anyway it is in
performance that we might see the Nexus
5 lose some ground simply because it is
the older phone its snapdragon 800 has
been outgunned by now by the newer
snapdragon 801 that we find in the
oneplus one ultimately the difference in
power is negligible especially for the
general user as you should be able to
get great performance from either device
the onus is more or less on the software
to provide the smooth and optimized
performance to take full advantage of
the processing and here you can't find a
better look at two different spectrums
on the one hand we have the Nexus 5's
fully updated Android ecosystem and the
promise of Google's backing for the
foreseeable future on the other hand we
have sandwich in mind always diligently
working to ensure that their operating
system is not only up-to-date but
performing a tip-top shape for the phone
that they've graced and these two motifs
seem to really benefit either device as
the Nexus 5 provides the canvas for all
software to thrive on Santa gen does
well to take full advantage of that
canvas to continuously tweak and
optimize their otherwise snappy
experience for a number of users this
might be where the oneplus one pulls
ahead as it does provide more than the
minimalistic Nexus 5 both provide the
same connectivity packages and will
provide the user with clearer calls
especially after the fixed call volume
in the current final units of the one
speaking of volume neither of these
devices provide stereo sound quality in
the loudspeaker as the Nexus 5 only
sports one speaker in one of the bottom
grills compared to the dual mono
speakers of the oneplus one which
admittedly does get pretty loud
but in the 1+1 the version that is
priced the same as the Nexus 5 comes
with a whopping 64 gigabytes of storage
which is more than enough to tide over
even the power user and in our
experience the oneplus one could use a
little more longevity but ultimately its
battery life is still quite better than
the Nexus 5 which can knock out with
heavier usage in under a day when it
comes to the cameras I think we all
remember the case of the Nexus 5 in
which its camera though touted for being
good at capturing memories actually
didn't really do much justice to the
hype luckily after an update this 8
megapixel shooter did get a nice boost
and became a pretty decent shooter in
its own right the interface is a pretty
simplistic Google camera providing only
some control over shots and modes like
photosphere HDR and the more recent lens
blur on the other hand the oneplus one
sports a 13 megapixel shooter that we
found got the job done quite well with
good quality all around and plenty of
options to cater your shot swipe around
the interface and you will easily be
able to change the mode while going
deeper in will allow you to change many
settings like even the video codec of
choice for your movie capturing quality
ultimately favors the oneplus one not
only because of its higher resolution
and its inherent color reproduction but
also because it's quality can be catered
in the various modes to the kind of shot
that you want the Nexus 5 is not a bad
performer by any means and is good for
the general user but not anyone that is
looking for more out of their smartphone
photography and finally in software we
take another look at two different sides
of the spectrum one that is vanilla and
the other that can be somewhat described
as swirl the Nexus 5 is the beloved
Android device by virtue of being
Google's own envisioning of their mobile
ecosystem it is quintessentially the way
Google intended Android to be for better
or worse you get the vanilla stock
Android KitKat experience with the usual
tropes ranging from the home screens to
the notification quick setting shade and
a couple of Easter eggs later throughout
its the canvas by which you can truly
create the experience you want and all
elements that are otherwise static are
actually still really easy on the eyes
there's no faulting the speed and
optimization put into KitKat and at the
same time its release of its of this
version of Android was received quite
well and has only continued to grow from
there but those who want more on top of
the vanilla experience already have a
long history of making their vision a
reality and none
are more recognizable than perhaps
cyanogen cm 11s the operating system on
the oneplus one might look like a stock
android experience at first glance but
it does bring with it powerful features
that plenty of users may have at one
point or another wished the stock build
had customization coming out the
woodwork from the theme showcase to even
the ability to cater the quick settings
to one's liking are further bolstered by
features like waking gestures to
hopefully create the ultimate Android
experience throw on top of all of that a
great gallery app the ability to
natively record your screen and even the
choice to opt for soft keys instead of
the built-in capacitive keys and you get
an Android experience that feels like it
gives you more power than ever for users
that really want a customizable
experience the CyanogenMod flavor of
KitKat is quite great but we won't count
out the vanilla flavor because not only
is it easy to use right out of the box
by virtue of being simple and thus fast
it is also the Android that will be
updated before all others a feature that
has consistently made the Nexus 5 the
more desirable choice for Android
purists and thus here is the rum both of
these phones are priced the same at
three hundred and fifty dollars while
that feels like a great price for any
high powered smartphone this is the
premium price for the oneplus one for
the 64 gigabyte version and the base
model for the nexus 5 and given all that
the oneplus one does offer at this price
it might seem like the better choice but
for the general user the answer might
not be so simple
after all the opportunity to get a
oneplus one is still a little scarce and
the Nexus 5 has been widely available
for some time now the larger everything
includes the size of the one making it
the harder to manipulate device for any
and all users out there who reminisce
about a time when phones were much
smaller and easier to use and in the
Nexus 5 people who want the latest and
greatest of Android can get it first
before all of the devices out there
including the oneplus one if bigger is
ultimately better for you then it
doesn't get any better than the smaller
price of the oneplus one for others who
don't need so much to enjoy the
smartphone life the Nexus 5 was and
still is a fine choice so no matter
which side of the KitKat you end up
choosing we still think you will be
quite satisfied as always thank you guys
very much for watching and hope you
enjoyed this comparison of the oneplus
one and the Nexus 5 we will have more
compare
of the 1+1 since it is slowly becoming
more available to all of you users out
there to the flagship devices that we
already have so you can see if the 1+1
is the choice for you in this case I do
believe that both of these phones are
kind of on par on the one hand you do
get a lot of power and features in the
1+1 but the Nexus 5 is our beloved
Android purest phone so you have to
really see which camp you're in in order
to find out which phone is better for
you but nonetheless stay tuned to
Android authority for all of the best
coverage including our future coverage
of the oneplus one compared to the
various flagships we have now you can
