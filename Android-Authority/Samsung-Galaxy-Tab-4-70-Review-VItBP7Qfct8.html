Android Authority and Samsung is back
with their latest iteration of the
Galaxy Tab lineup and if their pro
series of tablets is more than what you
really need from a tablet or just a
little too pricey then Samsung has got
you covered with three new options but
let's take a look specifically at the
Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 7.0 starting off
with the unboxing everything included
with the 7-inch Galaxy Tab 4 is pretty
basic
you've got your micro USB cable with a
wall adapter and your standard slew of
reading materials so there's no earbuds
or any extra goodies but moving along to
the tablet itself design wise it's very
typical Samsung with an all plastic
construction and it features the same
leather like texture that we've seen
since the note 3 but without the fake
stitching and it still doesn't feel like
leather either it just feels like hard
plastic but despite the plastic it's
actually very solidly constructed it
doesn't look or feel cheap and what
usually turns me off about Samsung
devices is their continued use of Chrome
and I don't really like Chrome on my
phones or tablets I just think it
cheapens the look of the device and
while there still is Chrome on the tab
for series of tablets Samsung has done a
really great job of minimizing their use
of it so thumbs up to Samsung for that
and hopefully they continue this trend
on to their future products it's not the
thinnest tablet coming in at 9
millimeters but it's got a nice weight
to it making it very comfortable to hold
for long periods of time but it does
feel a little bit slippery as the
textured back doesn't really provide as
much grip as I had hoped all the ports
are located on the top bottom and right
sides leaving the left side completely
blank but on the right side you'll find
these standard power and volume keys
which are very tactile and responsive an
IR blaster in the middle for controlling
your TV and a micro SD card slot which
supports up to 32 gigs on top is a 3.5
millimeter headset jack and following
along the bottom is your standard micro
USB port flipping around to the front
above the display is a 1.3 megapixel
front-facing camera and flanking the
bottom is Samsung's signature home
button with capacitive recent apps and
back buttons on the left and right which
interestingly enough aren't backlit May
the buttons difficult to find in the
dark on the back you'll find two small
slits for the speaker and it sounds
alright it's a pretty average speaker
with pretty average sound so it's
nothing to write home about
it gets decently loud but being placed
on the back means you'll either have to
have the tablet face down when listening
to music or have it propped up in order
to hear it when watching movies or
videos which is rather unfortunate also
on the front is the seven-inch display
with a resolution of 1280 by 800 it's
not super high resolution or as pixel
dense like you would find on the pro
series so you're definitely going to
notice pixels especially when reading
text while browsing the web or playing
graphically demanding games everything
else about the display is pretty good
though it's got great viewing angles
colors look nice and vibrant without
looking oversaturated and it gets really
bright making it easy to see outdoors
I'm also a really big fan of the 7 inch
form factor because it's big enough that
playing games or watching movies is a
much better experience than using your
phone but it's still small enough that
you can hold it in one hand making a
little bit more portable and easier to
carry around inside the Galaxy Tab 4 7.0
is being powered by a quad-core 1.2
gigahertz processor with 1.5 gigabytes
of RAM and 8 gigs of internal storage
with a little over four gigs actually
available so you're going to run out of
storage quickly without an SD card it's
got decent performance and in day-to-day
usage doing basic tasks like swiping
through home screens and opening up apps
it's responsive and runs fairly quickly
without a whole lot of lag it even
handles multitasking without any
problems but when you do find lag it's
in places like the gallery which is
really noticeable if you have a lot of
photos and gaming performance is very
sluggish with the GPU struggling to keep
things moving at a high frame rate
especially with more graphically
demanding titles games are still
certainly playable just don't expect a
buttery smooth performance as with the
rest of the hardware the camera on the
back is pretty mediocre
it's a three megapixel fixed-focus
camera with no LED flash so it's about
as basic as you can get it's there if
you really want to be that guy taking a
photo with your tablet but if you're
looking to take quality photos you're
better off sticking with your smartphone
the camera interface is pretty
bare-bones in comparison to what you
would get on something like the galaxy
s5 but you still get some of the more
basic shooting modes like beauty face
sound and shot
panorama sports and night mode picture
quality is exactly what you might expect
from a 3 megapixel camera they're very
low res so you're not going to be able
to zoom and crop without losing a lot of
detail color reproduction actually
doesn't look too bad though it's pretty
accurate and true to life but other than
that there's not much else that's good
about this camera it performs best when
outdoors but once you go inside photos
tend to become grainy especially in low
light and the lack of autofocus really
makes this camera struggle battery life
is probably one of the biggest
highlights of this seven-inch tablet
running the show is a four thousand
milliamp hour battery and I gotta admit
I was pretty satisfied with how long it
lasted it lasted me a couple of days
with pretty heavy usage doing a lot of
gaming browsing the web and checking
social networks but I managed to get
over seven hours of screen on time which
is pretty impressive and if you're a
lighter user I could imagine getting at
least three to four days with this
tablet before having to recharge Samsung
has been really good lately with
shipping their devices with the latest
version of Android and the Galaxy Tab
Ford lineup is no exception it's running
Android 4.4.2 KitKat out of the box with
Samsung's TouchWiz interface on top but
it's actually a much more slimmed down
version of TouchWiz which could either
be a good or bad thing depending on how
you feel about TouchWiz you still get
all of the blip and bloop sound effects
and the really slow folder animations
but a lot of the features like the
camera shortcut on the lockscreen my
magazine and air gestures are not
included there's also not as many
toggles built into the notification
shade either so if you want these extra
features you'll have to spring for
Samsung's Pro line of tablets some of
the more useful functions of TouchWiz
are still here though like multi window
if you want to be able to truly
multitask palm swipe to take a screen
shot and smart stay which keeps the
display on for as long as you are
looking at it the Galaxy Tab 4 7.0 is
available now for two hundred dollars in
both black and white it's Wi-Fi only as
of right now but there will be 3G and
LTE variants coming to carriers later
this year if you need the extra
connectivity personally I think the
price is a little bit steep especially
for the specs that you're getting and
for an extra $30 you can get a nexus 7
which offers a more
bang for your buck with a higher
resolution display a faster processor
more internal storage updates directly
from Google and a slightly better camera
if you really care about cameras on
tablets making the tab for a really hard
sell unless you really need that microSD
card expansion but there you have it for
the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 7.0 if you
really want a Samsung tablet that's
small and portable and a little bit
cheaper without all the bells and
whistles of the pro line then this might
be a great option to consider but keep
in mind it isn't without its
shortcomings and with other competitive
options for similar prices you might be
better off looking elsewhere but that's
pretty much it hopefully you guys
