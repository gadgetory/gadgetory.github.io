brought to you by Norton security hello
again ladies and gentlemen I'm Joe Hindy
the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Google Play weekly first
up this week is the kind of Android app
that I've been waiting for this year at
CES 2015 Hyundai announced a new android
wear application called blue link it's
made only for compatible hyundai cars
but it allows you to remote start your
car find the location of your car in a
crowded parking lots and it'll even call
roadside assistance for you while it
does fall into the category of gimmicky
the premise of controlling your things
with Android wear is one of the most
promising reasons for its existence and
this app illustrates that perfectly with
monument valley producer dan gray
announced this week that only five
percent of Monument Valley installs were
actually paid for of the ninety-five
percent that were not paid for those
folks were both people who bought the
game once and installed it on multiple
devices and of course people who pirated
the game we can't imagine that multiple
installs account for ninety-five percent
so the majority is likely piracy the
developers have stated that this doesn't
bother them because it's free
advertising and those people probably
weren't going to buy the game anyway but
if you need a statistical reasoning on
why freemium applications exist here you
go a teaser trailer for Need for Speed
No Limits was released this week and the
graphics looked pretty good according to
fire monkeys d development team behind
the game they are looking to squeeze out
every ounce of power out of mobile GPUs
to make this game work and the results
are pretty impressive the gameplay is
similar to classic racing games like
asphalt rather than drag racing games
like CSR racing the game should be out
sometime in 2015 and it will most likely
be a freemium title earlier this week
what's up announced that they have hit
700 monthly active users this is a huge
milestone for them considering that they
hit 600 million just four months ago
which means whatsapp is currently
racking up about 25 million new active
users every month perhaps the more
interesting factoid is that despite the
huge user base Facebook is currently
losing substantial amounts of money here
but Zuckerberg has said that he expects
that to turn around when the app hits
the 1 billion mark in our last bit of
news this week Microsoft has released
public Vedas of their office software
for tablets yes friends you can now get
Microsoft Word Excel and PowerPoint for
free on the google play store in their
preview formats it's important to note
that these are in beta
so there will likely be some bugs and
hiccups here and there nevertheless when
microsoft office would free last year
one of the chief complaints was the lack
of tablet support soon that problem will
be a thing of the past and if you want
to try it out the links are in the video
description below what zoom wants to see
some trending applications as usual if
you want to check any of these
applications out we'll have those links
available for you in the video
description below unclouded was updated
to version 2 point 0 this last week and
with it came a number of changes and now
has material design sports a dark theme
for premium users and has Microsoft
onedrive and box com supports there were
also these standard bug fixes and
performance improvements and remains one
of the best ways to manage multiple
cloud storage services in one
application soundcloud received a pretty
substantial update this last week with
it came some design tweaks to make it
more lollipop friendly along with
lollipop notification supports better
facebook integration french translation
and some bug fixes and performance
improvements it's worth noting that it's
not full on material design but it still
looks really good lego bionicle is a tap
to play hack and slash game where you
play as one of six heroes as you beat
the snot out of a bunch of robotic bad
guys the graphics are decent and the
gameplay is simple but that makes sense
because this game is geared towards kids
it may seem a bit repetitive for adults
but it is free with no in-app purchases
which helps make up for it snoop
snitches a crowdsource and open-source
security application that analyzes
mobile radio data to make sure your
mobile data isn't being tracked or
jacked by hackers or other people aiming
to do you ill will unfortunately the
application is a cornucopia of
restrictions you'll need to be rooted
not running a custom rom and have a
device with a qualcomm chipsets the West
up this week is Bitcoin wallet it's one
of the premier applications for Bitcoin
users and it received a pretty
substantial update this last week it now
comes with more material design along
with some under the hood security
enhancements along with the ability to
send and receive bitcoins you can also
buy bitcoins which is a nice touch if
