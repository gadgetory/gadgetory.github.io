Friday debate podcast by android
authority discussing topics in android
every week i am of course your host
Joshua Vergara from android authority
what's going on everybody and I'm joined
this week by the same co-hosts from last
week we're gonna go in here from them
real quick let's say hi to andrew grush
our lead editor over there and a writer
from our team Jonathan Feist house got
everybody very aptly named feisty over
there that were going to hear from him
and then of course our appt guy and
YouTube extraordinaire Joseph Hindi
hello Internet as always the Friday
debate is your source for a topic every

description below the youtube video but
you can also find it at the friday
debate podcast post made every week for
this at android authority com alright
guys let's go ahead and get into our
topic for this week I think it's a great
one Andrew wrote of rather long one so
I'm gonna go and read through it
actually know what let's dive and reread
read that off I put it in the chat there
so once you go ahead and get us started
on our topic here alright so there's
been a lot of rumors relating to
upcoming devices this week
and that's been doubly so for the HTC
One m9 one of the biggest things about
the m9 is the design in that it appears
to be almost identical to the m8 this
leads us to ask is it okay to reuse
designs or or does a recycle design make
the new handset less appealing if you do
feel that each new to model should have
its own distinct language how do you
feel HTC could have improved on the m8
m9s design I'm sorry if the rumored
images we've seen are correct yeah it's
true that we've had a lot of rumors this
past week not only on the HTC One m9 but
also on the other flagships after all we
have a lot of great shows coming up the
one in particular being of course Mobile
World Congress in Barcelona coming in
March so we're gonna see a lot from
there and there's a lot of rumors that
we're going to see these devices there I
love the idea that we're going to talk
about phone designs in general but since
we're focusing on the m9 I have one
quick question for everyone to answer
how did you feel about the design of the
One m8 since we're talking about how it
may evolve or not evolve therefore let's
start off with Joe Hindy over there um
the m7 in the m8 were both really well
designed devices like you know I believe
they won like design awards and whenever
people like talked about you know good
build quality they talk about HTC phones
that doesn't say anything about the
repair ability but you know you never go
to I pics if that doesn't matter um but
you know if it's similar or almost them
you know the same to the m8 it's not
something I would mind because I mean
the m8 was a good-looking phone yeah I
could probably use a little less bezels
uh because that bottom bezel was pretty
terrible also you're in that camp you
really don't like that HTC bar I think
it's time for the HTC bar to go it's not
that I don't like it it's that you know
we're in different places in the
relationship and I think it's time that
we went our separate ways everyone who
is a major carrier at this by media
major OEM at this point is its ditching
you know having a logo on the front HTC
needs to get with the times I don't know
I was never really that that that big I
didn't think it was that bad you know
that one bar that's right there i mean
when i went to the events and ask them
why that barstow there on behalf of our
fans of course they did always tell me
that you know there's a lot of
technology underneath the surface so we
need to have a little bit
room there to fit everything blah blah
blah but you know like having just the
one that HTC is a very Spartan logo it's
not all that flashy so just having those
three letters there didn't really bother
me too much feisty how do you feel about
the design of the m8 you know I was
pleasantly surprised with the dma m7 as
well you know I looked at the device
initially and I thought you know that's
not going to feel great in my hand but
when I picked those guys up they fit
nice they feel real good that you know
the ergonomics are great that back curve
around the edges is very nice i like
that you guys are talking about bezels i
find that the minimal side bezel I mean
it looks great but I'm you know the palm
of my hand is pushing the screen an
awful lot you know what I'm reaching
over try and get my thumb to the far
side of the screen I find that palm
touches are happening at quite a bit so
i'll agree that the the large HTC black
bar is you know maybe not exactly
attractive but i think i still want some
big bezels all right how about a young
mother brushy uh you know I thought the
m7 was a great design and the m8 just
basically took the same thing and
refined it and I think that was great I
was glad to see the capacitive keys go
uh not so thrilled on the you know duo
camera but I just thought it was kind of
a gimmick and not really necessary but
then again was so so was ultra pixel but
yeah I know I think that they've been on
a roll and I you know it gets to a point
where what can they do to improve but I
think that's kind of where they're at
you know they're running out of things
that they can change mmhmm yeah i mean
the as far as we're talking about
features but maybe it doesn't quite have
much to do with the design or the
aesthetic but what were you guys has
thoughts on the duo camera after all it
may be a feature a maybe a piece of
hardware that's on the phone we're not
necessary talk about the design but we
kind of are too because the dual camera
meant that there was an extra eye on the
back of its head so what did you guys
all think about the duo camera and is it
something you want to return to the m9
and possibly i felt like okay for me I
felt like that was the only weird part
of the design i actually thought that
everything looked really great it wasn't
quite as ridge
in its design as the m7 bm7 seemed a
little sharp in some edges and that was
not the case in the MAS but I just
couldn't get over the fact that there
was this little hole on the top of my
phone's head what were you guys thinking
in terms of at least the duo camera um I
had a purpose didn't it was supposed to
help with like focus and like lens blur
kind of stuff I got ya I got like the
focus depth information so that you can
use that was it was like the first phone
to try and tackle the whole unfocused /d
focus future okay um since it had a
point I'm okay with it it's one of those
things were like I don't take a lot of
pictures on my cell phone so something a
feature like that is next to useless for
somebody like me at the htc's camera
history in general has always been a
little the mega pixel thing has had
mixed reviews since its inception so um
you know the idea that their work you
know doing these weird little features
before perfecting the camera is a little
ridiculous but it isn't the the m9 is
supposed to have something like a 20
megapixel camera isn't it yeah like
that's at least a rumor and if the
renders are correct we're not seeing a
dual camera up at the top we're just
seeing a much larger piece of optics on
the back which you know I think I think
might be a nice move considering that I
don't know about you guys you can
definitely talk on this but i don't
think the dual camera ever proved itself
honestly know and the thing is that like
to do okay or the dual camera whatever
would have been better if the camera
itself were worth taking those kind of
pictures with because you know no one no
one's buying the HTC one m7 or the m84
it's you know for the camera quality
they're buying sony and iphone and stuff
like that so you know like if you're
already not buying a phone for the
camera then the extra camera features
just seemed kind of useless to me that's
just me though okay how did a duo fair
for you guys over there Feist engrish
actually you know when the m8 first came
out I was interested I'd looked at that
phone I thought maybe I'd buy one but I
do take an awful lot of pictures with my
camera or with my phone sorry and you
know certainly not professional grade
photos but you know just snapping even
the
sunset that sort of stuff and I bought
into the the four megapixel of the HTC
ultrapixel it's just it was too small
for my liking not that I worry so much
about the pixel count just that from
what I was seeing that the performance
of the camera and the end result of the
photos it it was less than my
five-year-old little LG phone so I stuck
with a little LG and I went with a
different device and I would almost say
that the only reason I did not get the
m8 was because of the camera hmm wedgie
well as I kind of alluded to I wasn't a
fan of the duo I wasn't a fan of the
ultrapixels I really haven't been a fan
of a she sees cameras in recent times
and you know I thought the picture
quality was okay but I don't think it
really like you said it didn't prove
itself it didn't really add what it was
supposed to my opinion and aesthetically
I thought it looked really stupid you
know putting it blah i thought it looks
stupid it just you know um I you know I
I like the HTC the HTC one m7 CH design
a little better actually I agree with
you on you know some of the change as
far as the rigidness and stuff but you
know I actually that's why I'm excited
by the you know that even though people
are going to complain that it's not
different enough I'm glad they've
ditched the deal with the m9 that
they're going back to you know just a
single camera on the back oh sure um
yeah it might be a nice little throwback
and if the camera optics are you know
the 20 megapixels or something like that
you know my up 20.7 20.7 I just I just
messed with the 20.7 megapixel camera on
a different phone I was amazing mx4 pro
and it certainly did a pretty good job
we'll see what HTC is able to do with
all the experience they got from there
ultrapixel days and see what that would
they will be able to do with 20.7
megapixel abs and it is worth noting
that the ultrapixel may not be gone from
the m9 just gone on the back the rumors
claim that we could be seeing the
ultrapixel on the front you know like
like with the desire HD eight 8 26 yeah
so there's also another rumor that says
it's gonna be a 13 megapixel so it's
hard to say
each one's right but oh yeah obviously
we're depending on the market you know
they could even go that route it's hard
yeah exactly we're doing a lot of
speculation here oh yeah well and I
don't think HTC you know H even though
it doesn't do well obviously it didn't
do well on the the ultrapixel didn't do
well with the m7 as far as reception and
yet they kept with it the MA because
they invested into it and so I think if
they can find a way to keep it around in
some form I think they will oh yeah
definitely all right let's go ahead and
talk about the design of the m9 then
these renders are pretty much telling us
that the design of the m8 for better or
worse is pretty much going to be
recycled and it's it'll have those black
lines on the top and bottom of the back
the hairline brushed aluminum on the bag
the nice rounded corners that the m8 was
pretty much getting a lot of awards for
it at least in terms of its design but
does it look too much like the m8 um you
know something I'm going to be a the guy
who sides with the OEMs on this one of
just playing the devil's advocate here
but I mean these guys have approximately
365 to day 365 days to design and create
the the next great smartphone and I
think that you know with such you know
it's such a limited time and they
already have a design that works really
well I mean everyone loved the design of
the m8 yo sans the double camera
stupidness but you know the eeo the you
know the m7 and the m8 were
extraordinarily designed to devices and
people loved that you know other OEMs
why can't you be more like HTC and do
this awesome design thing that you do so
I and it's not like Samsung where
everyone wants them to change and has
wanted them to change since the galaxy
s3 like no more plastic Samsung boo you
know no one's doing anything like that
with HTC so I think the idea that you
know that they're gonna go with a
similar design for you know for this
year they did last year in the year
before that you know I mean it's a
winning formula you know why would you
why fix it if it's not broken right okay
fair enough so you think that so would
this be the the time for a recycling of
this design what if like say the who
knows what they're going to call
m10 coming after this what if that phone
looked exactly the same as the MA and
what looks like could be the m9 what is
there a time when when design becomes
tiresome um definitely look at the
Galaxy S series I mean are they posting
like lower profits then they have been
the last few years because I mean you
look at the galaxy s 3 4 5 and probably
six and you know it's the same kind of
stuff just year after year just a little
bit different no that I don't see how
six is gonna be amazing it's gonna be
different why don't they say there's no
time to try and market it like it will
be Samsung's paying me out of the table
right now well grocery how about you men
like how do you feel about the m9
essentially having a very similar look
to the m8 like do you think that this
recycling is something that HTC should
be doing okay so like like Joe was
saying on one hand I agree if it's not
broken why fix it but on the other hand
if I was upgrading from an m7 or an even
an m8 I feel like there's not much to
show off you know uh many of the special
software features that will come to the
m9 will probably make their way to the
m7 at ma eventually anyway and so that
pretty much leaves improve specs and
performance well that's kind of hard to
like boast to your friends and things
about you know and something you can't
really show them and yeah obviously I
hope that we're not buying our phones
just to impress people but you know
still it's it's one of those things that
you know oh wow this looks exactly like
I had before ha what's the point I mean
yeah and even the performance you know
that's a whole other subject but we're
not seeing you know I can use a nexus
for even today and you'd be able to
pretty much play it almost anything any
game you know at least semi okay and
pretty much any app you find on google
play and that's a few years old now and
so i guess i see if there's no design
change it kind of you know what are they
selling you on why should you upgrade
yeah that's the hope that the features
underneath are going to be as compelling
as they should be as far as impressing
other people i mean i feel like the I
feel like HTC kind of has that feather
in their cap though I've been hearing
from a lot of people or did hear from a
lot of people at least in the last two
trade shows that you know all these
phones are coming out and they they they
don't necessarily all look the same but
it's really the certain phones like the
m7 or the m8 that have very different
way of looking at design that people are
actually like well what phone is that so
I mean I guess in that sense the m82 the
m9 design might make a little bit of
sense but i think i agree with your
garage like that's it's not really truly
changing the experience if it just feels
and looks the same you're gonna look at
your phone after you upgrade it and
you're like I kind of feel like I got
the same thing just somewhat better and
that's exactly like like Joe is saying
that's exactly what people were
complaining about with the galaxy line
you know people didn't complain that
much initially with like you know but by
the time we got the galaxy s5 it's like
okay guys seriously we need something
they're friends yeah exactly like I
think this is the last year where HTC is
gonna be able to go with this kind of
design and not get total outrage like
Samsung did I think they're gonna get
flack I think they're gonna get flack
already but i agree with you i don't
think i think if they do this again
that's one we're really going to start
having people complain yeah and
hopefully they have the forward-thinking
for that feisty thoughts on the look of
the m9 being too much like the m8
perhaps well you know you guys have
covered these phones specifically and
you know if it's not broken don't fix it
all that kind of stuff but yeah I think
this speaks to a larger shift in the
mobile industry you look at the world of
laptops for example and I've got to HP
laptop sitting here right in front of me
they look relatively close to the same
but you know what one of them is eight
years old it's running beat-up old linux
and the other one is a brand new
Chromebook they look the same on the
outside but the difference is when you
fire them up are drastic and I think you
know we've come to expect that a laptop
is a again there's going to be nuances
in the in the design changes but for the
most part it's you know it's a big
rectangle with rounded corners you flip
it up there's a keyboard you get
essentially the same overall design but
we've come to look past that and look at
the functionality and you know just the
features of the device and that's where
I'm at with the mobile industry with the
cell phones I don't need a new design I
don't
need new Kevlar back cover for example I
just want her you know I I have to you
know interject a little bit uh I
disagree in a way because yeah all
laptops do pretty much look the same
from model to model but unless you're
like a hipster in a coffee shop you know
trying to write your next novel you're
probably not showing off your laptop
that much don't make sure 1mon you're
walking around with you have it flipped
out you're walking past people hey
what's that you know I think it matters
more on the mobile side I take offense
that hipster quote well I mean that that
that is part of it i mean it's it's a
matter of looking at what the ecosystem
really wants out of you you know and
maybe we are moving into this world
where smartphones are starting to become
maybe a little bit like laptops and you
know but the thing is the the features
underneath have to be that compelling in
order for you to go from one to the
other if i see did you have more to say
on the subject no that's okay well we'll
leave it sit there's writing novels
that's enough yeah man saying it that's
just my you know take that I I feel like
you know there's more there's more need
for design on the mobile than there is a
laptop but if you disagree yeah go for
it um well Milton this boils down to a
personal preference I I don't really
mind what people think of the phones
that I have it on hand you know I've got
some tiny phones I whip them out in
public people look at me funny because
they're 4.3 inches and and obviously I
don't obviously your common sense as an
artist and yeah quite the opposite of
the 4 inch phone yeah so you know I'm
not too concerned what people think of
me and my devices but I definitely I see
what you're saying you know in the world
of impressing others that you know
having the big new glossy phones is it
you know that that's important but you
know for me as long as the features are
there and as long as the device performs
as needed I'm okay with the looks okay
yeah
I think I think I fall under Feist in
this particular sense but then again you
know I I do have to put it out there I'm
sure we've been called out on it before
but as a phone reviewer we work with so
many different phones that we don't
really have the luxury we're not the
luxury but we don't have to pick a phone
solely based on that personal preference
because well I have literally this
roller that I could just roll out and
there's all the phones that I review oh
so I don't really need to choose but if
i had to put like my finger on how i
feel about the m9 i do think that if it
takes on the design of the m8 i think
that's a really good thing yes after
this if it happens again that's when we
have to speak up but even then it's it
is a nice design and as long as
everything underneath especially the
camera especially the freaking camera is
a lot better now than I'm sure I can
forgive what might feel like a very
similar phone you know something I
didn't really think about until like
just now but you know it is it could it
be possible that these you know
companies are just trying to figure out
like a like their own little footprint
can we're talking about a candy bar here
you know exactly how many different ways
can you make a phone that shape actually
look without without what else starting
to get you know totally ridiculous with
it so you know like if HTC goes with
like the brushed aluminum and samsung
wants to go with the button on the front
and then you know LG wants go with the
buttons on the back you know all of a
sudden it's not like repeating the
design year after year it's creating a
like a something that people can
recognize as a brand like you pull a
brushed aluminum phone out of your
pocket boom you've got an HTC phone you
pull a phone out and got a button on the
front or about on the back boom samsung
LG so like you know there might actually
not only be you know you know it might
get old for some people but there's
actually there might actually be a
benefit to repeating the design year
after year because I mean you pull the
galaxy s3 out of your pocket everybody
knows that's a samsung phone and you
know four or five probably six you know
going all the back to two and even one
you know you pull any of those phones
out of your pocket like man that looks
like a samsung phone or an iphone if you
want to be well if you want to be a
lawyer about it that's that's you know
if somebody pulls a Taser out of their
pocket they're like hey that's grush
ease project exactly yeah
that's the confidence obviously it does
work for some people to have the same
design because I mean Lenovo and IBM
have been doing that with a thinkpad
since the beginning of time for actively
yeah they looking as yet they still sell
yeah they look exactly the same 10 years
ago yeah yeah you buy a thinkpad today
it pretty much looks like I thinkpad
from nineteen ninety five stars I'll own
up in the middle I love that thing um
yeah and I heartily agree i mean--
record being recognizable is probably
probably like at least forty percent of
success in the market and being able to
you know just whip something out and
everyone's like whoa i recognize what
brand that is i recognize exactly what
it should be able to do and stuff like
that I know odd wording I was very odd
wording something I want us to whip it
out and have everybody know what it is
is mine is this is HTC phone but like so
we brought up that that point about
recognizability and I think that's a
great way it's a sort of segue into what
I think would be a good way of like
exploring what these other companies are
doing in that particular space we
brought up Samsung already and we can
always come back to that and feel free
to bring it up but this is the one that
I really want to put out there Sony why
is it that we get on Samsung's case so
hard about recycling the glossy plastic
which may not be the case for the
upcoming s6 in the note 5 you never know
the note 4 certainly didn't have glossy
plastic on it it was all it had the
metal frame and had that new backing the
s5 on the other hand a little bit
questionable we weren't sure what they
were thinking of when we did that but
Sony ever since the Xperia Z the very
first one like one of the first phones I
ever reviewed at least that is a phone
that potentially looks the same every
six months even so so what is it about
Sony that almost makes us forgive them
for that kind nobody cares about Sony
that's the problem they're not popular
agree nope yo like I mean dude alright
so yeah I think about most of us are you
know us-based bloggers and not just at
android authority the other places too
of most of us live in the united states
and sony has literally no footprint here
like you have to be on t-mobile and you
have to want to get the
the s version the z1s of if you want to
get a sony product i think they like the
last really good i want to say good but
the last like really big sony phone was
the the one that moved out and do a
controller well that it was on verizon
with the xperia play right and then it
was like the the z1s and then like
outside of that I can't I mean there's
there's been others I'm just I can't
think of like any other except for those
two that have been out the United States
and um you know I mean from what I
gather they're not really father's III
was is III the United States both
t-mobile and Verizon oh well I mean it's
on verizon with the Z dad surprises it's
a decent duty yeah yeah exactly yeah but
3v the z1s and I thats the same problem
that Samsung had with the galaxy s2
because he had the epic 4g touch then
the galaxy s2 and then yeah happy
exactly like there were all these
different names for essentially the same
device and it's just you know when it's
just mismanagement Sony is mismanaged
and they're not very popular in at least
the United States and from what I gather
at least from the news i've been reading
they're not really that popular abroad
either aren't they like minimizing their
mobile division and starting over or
something like that well i mean from
what i can tell in cuz you don't have to
go too far from America to find Sony
sort of having a better foothold I mean
but up in Canada they're they're all
over and billboards and and everything
like you don't get that much marketing
here and even LA where I'm from but from
what I can tell Canada has a little bit
better of a sony presence but europe
those guys over there really love their
sony stuff that's the reason why
whenever a new sony phone comes out
there all I come out to London and then
we're like no we can't afford that but
yeah okay I can see that but at the same
time it's like you know we still get
these phones every every every six
months as reviewers at least and you
know have you ever watched like let's
say my first looks from mwc because you
know essentially we're probably going to
be looking at a z4 coming up in the next
couple months at mwc if you were to see
that phone and there's a radio render of
it it's going to look well according to
the rain
it's going to look basically like a XIII
again or z2 again if you were to see
that phone on a video that I created
later and I later in a month or so would
you have the same reaction looking at
that that you do at the s5 or four from
before the s 3 and s 2 it's not the
reaction you would have with that
because I don't feel like that's the
case was now um it would be like oh hey
look there's a sony phone right there
well does the z3 of the z2 were almost
literally the exact same phone I mean
there's only a few things from a spec
sheet point of view that were different
between them and yet if you remember it
was getting a lot of praise on our site
the comments were just exploding about
how awesome this phone is and I you know
I don't mind Sony but I was like okay
you know cuz it was at the same time we
were getting a lot of negative from the
galaxy s5 it's like well at least Sony
dummy least uh i'm not a huge samsung
fan but i had to give it at least they
did something different well you know i
didn't like what they did different but
it was at least something but sony
pretty much gave us the same phone and
awesome well I mean Sony from rileys
from our experience sony has had a very
loyal fanbase you know and it's not even
just true for their mobile division i
mean i'm a playstation user myself and i
swear by it you know I've gone into
fights with people already about how
like you know I prefer my ps4 over any
Xbox and people get real mad at me and
it becomes a flame war of so okay well
without you just say yeah I have an xbox
one I'm totally effect yeah I'm gonna
hail I'm gonna halo all up in this bitch
sorry well let's put this way are you
are you a big call of duty player is
that the reason why you want froeken or
what was God no I I got your hate call
what's your main game then I um halo
halo okay see that's the thing like its
it has to do with what the ecosystem has
and I think that's I think that's what
makes makes it so that you can kind of I
don't know like maybe I'm drinking the
Sony kool-aid a little bit that I I
don't really feel that vitriol over the
fact that the Sony phones come out and
they're usually the same and even more
to their credit or to their doom it
comes on every six months every have a
month week every half year we get
another phone that you can tell it's a
sony phone but at the same time there's
not really a whole lot that's changing
um how about a feisty we haven't heard
from you in a little bit like how do you
feel about the recycling at least in
terms of Sony's way of doing it you know
I don't want to say this but I think
we've given up on Sony that's all wrong
I when I expect you guys no sorry let me
clarify that I've given up on them
design-wise now when I look at a spec
sheet of those of the Sony Xperia z3 and
whatnot and even the z2 I really liked
that phone again looking at the spec
sheet looking at the performance looking
at the end result of the photos that
those things take I really like the Sony
devices I do I really do I I would have
bought one but design wise it's just
it's a hunk of plastic and metal and
whatever it's made out of an you know it
gets the job done it has the buttons it
has the screen but it designed just so
to speak given up on it you pretty much
expect them to not change it at all so
you just kind of accept it exactly yes
same goes for their laptops the same
goes for their stereo equipment I
they're set in their ways they've got
their iconic designs which exactly what
we were talking about earlier that HTC
could be you know going along the lines
of now from the m 8 am-9 and i'm
comfortable with their design it's has
nothing spectacular but it's solid and
it's functional and that's what I'm
looking for ok um yeah I just pointing
this out there if there was a sony phone
that looked like that had that look and
feel of like you know if I put it in my
hand and I think to myself this is like
a ps4 I think I would love that person
Jose over there scoffing I actually I
actually love all video games just I am
like I am like Martin Luther King of
video game consoles whatever you want to
play you're still a gamer in my book I
don't care what it is o people can play
can't believe you just equated yourself
oh I'll drop that call back to this past
week okay so okay so we kind of we kind
of
explored the Sony side of things so
let's go ahead and double back to
Samsung then we have a company like so
anywhere they recycle their design but
you despite how negative I didn't
realize you guys were going to take it
like you know either no one really cares
about Sony as much as joe said or
jonathan weiss said we were pretty much
expected so we just sort of accept it
samsung on the other hand they try
really hard every single year at least
ever since the s3 the s4 came out and it
was a perfecting of the s3 design at
least in my opinion then yes 5 came out
and also it looked like a band-aid it
had a fingerprint reader on the back not
a fingerprint reader a heart rate
monitor on the back rather and it just
kind of it took what design we were
expecting from them and kind of made it
like Frankenstein ish I feel like how
what is it about Samsung then that makes
it so that they can put these tiny
little things in their phones and it's
obvious they're trying but they still
get so much flak well you kind of
answered your own question didn't it was
because they try so hard they're always
in your face about their innovative bold
designs in their innovative features and
their innovation and their innovative
innovation asst and and all of that
stuff and then like they come out with
it and it's the same phone with a
slightly different back with a couple of
extra knickknacks tacked on for good
measure you know and i think you know
that's something I was gonna say this
I'm glad you brought it up but you
that's probably why we don't really care
too much about Sony's design and the
fact that they reuse it over and over
again because they don't slap you in the
face with their you know what their
phones go and look at our bold new
design and it's the same design every
year they don't do that they're just
like hey look here's this new phone like
it or hate it here it is we're Samsung
you know they are just everywhere with
it like bold new designs better than the
iphone iphone killer hashtag awesome but
it but if we're going to have sony do
what they do with their designs and now
it looks like for the most part at least
if the if the m9 renders are correct
we're going to get that sort of type of
deal with HTC where their designs are
kind of recycled why is it that we don't
give Samsung the benefit of
doubt um because we've been burned
before we've been hurt before Samson
exactly like a check out our you know
this is gonna be the most exciting
galaxy s yet and then you know that was
the year of the horrible Broadway show
you know how do you not hate you're not
alright not hate on but how do you not
like you know look at a company that
does that and you're like no no as bad
samsung put out your hand so I can smack
it is bad go in the corner you're in
timeout samsung until next year till the
galaxy s5 year in time out then galaxy
s5 bold new design and it's a band-aid I
mean it I do i do have to give you some
credit for bringing up the broadway show
that was pretty terrible i'm not gonna
lie how about a gresham face that s 6 s5
you know putting putting some new
features on there that you know other
people aren't you know they're trying to
be different but is it enough I think we
got a big dog little dog situation here
or big dog underdog situation let's be
on a samsung is the big guys right now
whatever they do is it's in the public
eye it's going to get scrutinized
companies like HTC there a little bit
smaller now of course they're quite
popular they're doing well for
themselves but they're still quite small
there so to speak the underdog that
there's more loyal fans there's there's
fans that want to push and help grow the
the ecosystem get more devices and I
think that's a major part of it where it
doesn't much matter what Samsung HTC do
they're going to be either praised are
scrutinized by a large portion of the
users alright how about you crush so I
mean a lot of has to do with I agree i'm
not he well I mentioned ready I'm not I
don't say I'm some devices not massive
fan of touch was but I didn't think
they'd try really hard you know I and I
have to defend them I mean that you know
we asked for a change they give us a
change and we're not it's not good
enough but part of its that Samsung is
one of those companies it seems like
they do a great job of listening but not
listening like it'd be like if my wife
told me I drink too much beer
I say okay I'll get a bunch of whiskey
instead you know I listened I didn't do
what she was asking she was telling me I
drink too much by the way I don't drink
too much but as an example uh you know
and so a little bit listeners just made
a face like sure sure you don't drink
too much I don't I swear huh anyway you
know it's it's they listen but then they
go and they deliver something that
wasn't what we asked you know we want
something different Samsung okay well
we'll give you a dimpled back we were
asking for metal maybe some change up to
your you know keys which have you know
been the exact same for forever you know
we didn't ask for a heart rate monitor
we didn't necessarily ask for a
fingerprint scanners know some people
like that you know we just wanted you to
make a big change and so they do a good
job of listening but then not listening
they don't really follow through i guess
why they follow through but they don't
deliver what we asked for oh ok ok we
think you have a great point but we're
not gonna change it the right way that
was kind of my example there was yeah
okay I'll do it but I'm not doing what
you asked I'm just doing something
different you know okay let me let me
put this out there then we're talking
about the s6 this whole time but what
about say the note series where at least
this is what i said when i when i
reviewed the note 4 was the notes the
note line has completely completely
established itself as the real flagship
for samsung the S line is now the
experimental line it's where they put
some of the weird crap but the note is
the note is the polished more like
refined design phone so I guess that's
the reason why I'm kind of asking like
you know maybe we give Samsung the
benefit of the doubt because they're
capable of creating a phone that just
blows away design that note for to me is
still one of the best feeling phablets
out there and I hate saying the word
phablet but it's uh to me that was one
of the most beautifully designed phones
of 2014 at least I agree with you
actually think that even though Samsung
still gets negative flack there for the
note series I actually think the note
series is fine looking I you know yeah
you know I metal you know which they
already technically did but you know
going more metal full unibody whatever
but i think that the note series is
great it's just the S series but
um people I do agree that because of the
big guy people are gonna complain
they're just gonna complain you know
that's how it always is and so I don't
think Samsung can do anything that you
know if they give us if the galaxy s6
for example is rumored to have a unibody
design supposedly maybe a slightly less
aggressive TouchWiz which we've kind of
seen what the a series now so it's
possible um but I really don't think
that's gonna happen honestly well I like
I said slightly is yeah where they're
slightly toned oh um but even if they
did that people are still gonna complain
why is the cook why's your front keys
still here why haven't you change the
front of the phone you know people are
going to find something to complain
about yeah it sounded like Joe did you
want to chime in I was just going to
agree with everything the rush you just
said you put enough people in you know
one space and someone's gonna find
something wrong with something and start
complaining about it okay well um we are
nearing the last let's say five ten
minutes of our podcast here which is a
perfect time for me now that we've
pretty much talked about the three
different companies and their different
ways of design and what they do every
single year or half here in the case of
Sony so if people if they're reusing
design let's put it this way let's let's
go for that brass ring again I'm going
to try to do this every episode what is
a what what design do you want to see in
a phone it doesn't have to be from one
of the current manufacturers because
like Joe said it's probably because
they're trying to create this identity
that is so recognizable that they're
never gonna sway from it because it
makes people know who they are so what
is a phone that what's this what's a
design aspect that you want out of a
phone what what would be the next the
next great thing and was a big thing I
don't want to use a samsung line well
what's the what's the next innovation in
design that you're looking for if these
companies seem to have found what works
for them um okay I'll go first um I'm I
don't know I don't know the answer this
question I am a stupid consumer I don't
know what I want I just know that I want
something I know I always liked HTC's
design but I like you know the Galaxy
Note design I like Sony's design like I
like all of these designs they're just
always seems to be like that one
thing that's missing from these phones
like you know HTC I really want a 5.5
inch HTC One phone that doesn't suck HTC
one max mmmm but you know I didn't like
you with the Galaxy Note series like I
would really love a galaxy note without
the front buttons or you know something
like so it's all and actually i love
sony pretty much the way that they are
but i can't ever get them because
they're never available to me but uh you
know it's just like it seems like all of
these OEMs are missing just a little
something to make it at least for me
absolutely perfect and i guess you know
for me it be you know i don't know uh
what i do know though is that i do i
would love to see people doing more
crazy things um because you know the the
note edge the the lg1 that bends with
the he's self-healing back that thing
yeah the flex yeah you know um which
which means which I you're going in the
direction that i was expecting was um is
there like a material choice that you
prefer and you want to see you know I
know we've seen aluminum cattle are
backing and all that you know personally
I'm I would love to see some sort of
like a carbon fiber phone I think that
yeah definitely but yeah um how about
form factors though because you were you
were mentioning earlier that you know
these are all candy bar phones is there
is there a form factor that you think we
could go to because as far as I feel
like we've plateaued in terms of these
black slate designs that are just like
flat panels and stuff like that like is
there anything that maybe you want to
bring back or the new form factor like
let's put this let's put this example
out there and this in this world of
phones that all seem to have the same
type of aesthetic we have something like
you said that the edge to flex but then
I kept thinking about the yotaphone or
you know it made the back useful so it
that way and you know what what's this
what's this dream phone that we might
think about in terms of design um I
again I don't know I I said I'm a stupid
consumer I know I want something but I
don't know what it is so uh okay
ultimately I'm gonna have to pass on the
question I just know that you know most
places are like so close to having like
the perfect candy bar for me and then
they don't get there and I hope that
they keep experimenting to find new
stuff because I mean
you know the candy bar is starting to
get old okay how about a rushee for me I
just want more options you know I like
the OEMs to think outside the box a
little bit you know for example
blackberry yes it is a ridiculous design
but the passport at least was different
yotaphone you know as the ink you know
different G flex note edge I just want
them to think outside the box um and not
push the same design year after year I
guess to me even though I said it was
okay to an extent it's boring uh like I
I mean I'm not gonna complain about it
like you know if my phone in duplicate
my next one ends up looking similar to
my last phone i'm not going to complain
about it but i do think that the perfect
phone is just simply something that is
willing to risk a little bit and try
something different you know what that
is I have no clue like Joe you know but
I do look forward to flexible phones to
you know beyond what we have now to
truly flexible phones I do look forward
to that and I think we will get there so
yeah basically I just want more
experiment you know more experimentation
from the OEMs okay so things like that I
do wanna say that as far as realistic
obtainable things I want every single
OEM to just simply put front-facing
speakers on all their phones and that
would probably be enough to reach and
sister that is awesome yeah that is that
is a great great addition for all the
phones associate the ones that we have
designed right now um I have I cuz I
because I had this like idea in mind and
i'll put it out there after we hear from
feisty but i just like okay yeah let's
let's hear from feisty first like
weather what's uh what's a phone look
like to you that design wise would would
I guess changed the game or what would
really appeal to you in terms of design
what's one what's what what do you want
out of your phone I have to agree with
the other guys so far I mean that
there's a lot of great stuff out there
but it's all limited and you get the
front facing speakers that would be
awesome Joe I could see him running into
a store he finds exactly the phone he
wants but it's running a Snapdragon 200
processor dude that's happened before
it's totally happened before absolutely
so for me uh I believe that the spa
is a delimiter right now for our
technology I cannot help but think of
the Moto 360 the round face SmartWatch
that you know now that we're you know
it's been out for several months it
hasn't per se changed the industry but
the hype around that device nobody cared
what the internals were going to be when
when it was first announced just look at
that thing it's got a round display it
you know it breaks the mold all of the
phones out right now have square
displays I know that's true all of our
laptops all of our tablets everything
they all have square display that said
but that's my point is I think the next
big thing sorry is on who it is
dependent on different types of displays
have been bent displays flexible
displays that's great what about
stretchable displays and round displays
well stretch that would be often that he
has imagined return of stretch armstrong
the smartphone that's a that's a nice
read several years back about you know
there's some researchers in Japan they
had some you know the quality was very
poor but they were working on it
stretchable electronics stretch
stretchable displays it's more like an e
ink type display but you know you pull a
a four-inch phone out of your pocket and
you stretch it out to a 10 inch tablet
that one cept is that's 10 years down
the road don't get me wrong we may be
even further but that's the next big
thing next big thing you had to say it
twice their can't omit you have to make
sure Samsung souza thanks a bunch of
iced tea no on the contrary Samsung's
like let's send feisty a review unit one
of the round displayed I think they are
supposedly working on a round watch so
yeah that could be I think for me what
we are seeing some some thinking outside
the box but I want to see some retro
designs i want to see i talked about
carbon fiber before and i think that you
know moving forward that could be a type
of material that we use for our phones
but i won
you're I have to keyboard aren't you
well okay that's like he warded like I
do it's govern- keyboards man um I i do
miss keyboards and I I'm really excited
to do my flashback series with the HTC
g1 coming up which is coming very very
soon and I'm gonna use it but it's a
small freakin phone but it's fine but um
yeah just feisty was talking about
displays and I agree it's a hindrance
the reason why I think it's a hindrance
is because it became the hallmark of a
smartphone and we totally forgot that
you know not we could we could have a
great experience on a phone without
needing the entire thing to look like a
screen or look like the remote control
of the future and but this is what I was
gonna put out there and I'm not even
going to get into it because just just
laid let's sit in your head for a little
bit the the OEM the company that is able
to create the next flip phone smartphone
is the one that all I'll be an early
adopter of that I will buy that first
day I'll stand in line for that by
yourself well dark honestly I also miss
flip phones i mean there's there some of
them yeah and the last one that I
remember was Samsung made it and it was
so expensive that day that only one
person could buy and it was Jackie Chan
I believe LG just released if I think
was LG just released a new one well it's
gotta be more but it's like a Snapdragon
like 200 or something exactly like I'm
looking for you know flip phones used to
be I mean looking back to like the old
days is like the motorola razr everyone
had that you know I would love for flip
phones to to come back from with like a
heyday you know if we have flexible
display as I display could bend in half
and then you can open it up and there
you have your full 4 45 inch display um
yeah that's that's what I was thinking
but you know if something that's
attainable maybe a carbon fiber phone
I'm kind of cool with that but yeah
alright great well I did realize that we
didn't necessarily talk about LG and
that big stint earlier but I think real
quick I think we all kind of give LG the
benefit of the doubt because they went
different they have the rear facing
button layout and also the curved
display on the G flex so I feel like you
know that's where we give them the
benefit
because they have actually did some some
changes in their design and it's not
necessarily recycled every single time
and even if it is it's it's different
from the other phones I don't know if
you guys are definitely yep absolutely
i'll check in terms of their flagships
yes yeah absolutely so yeah that's why I
cuz I realize you guys mentioned the g
flex no we didn't talk about LG and then
I thought about for a little bit more
okay yeah that's probably why but in any
case I think that should do it for this
week's topic for the Friday debate once
again we talked about the HTC One m9 and
the fact that it might look a little bit
like the m8 and then we started
exploring a couple other OEMs to see why
they are able to do what they do and we
may or may not love or hate them as
