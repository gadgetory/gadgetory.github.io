Android land was the wall we made Google
Nexus 6p it was and still is one the
darling gems in the space prior to it
HTC had that reputation of being the
best when it comes to phone designs that
use metal well now HTC's the underdog
but there's a lot of anticipation riding
on its latest efforts hey guys John
Velasco here with Android authority and
we're doing a quick look between the HTC
10 and the Google Nexus 6p
like we said the Nexus 6p is
impressively good-looking its original
and it doesn't look like anything else
however it's just a handful to operate
it's so good that some folks even have
gone on say that Huawei has supplanted
HTC as bringing the king of metal phones
now you think that they give up but HTC
responds back in a huge way HTC 10 is
sure to plays with its one-of-a-kind
metal design that's inspired by light
and sculpted to perfection it appears to
be more meticulously designed but it's
also more compact and easier to handle
since it's the larger of the two the
Nexus 6p has a bigger 5.7 inch quad HD
AMOLED screen this of course makes the
5.2 inch quad HD Super LCD 5 display of
the HTC 10 point by comparison still we
can agree that the two displays produce
plenty of sharp visuals and incredible
detail being a Malayan all the next six
piece display tends to appear
oversaturated unless you're in
developers mode and set its color
calibration to the srgb mode in contrast
the HTC 10 screen also appears to be
saturated but not as much
both have fingerprint sensors that use
the same implementation but they're
positioned differently its rear manner
with the Nexus 6p what's beneath the
display with HTC 10 they both work fine
though being a last generation device
the Nexus 6p leverages the Qualcomm
Snapdragon 810 chip the hardware is
still quite capable by today's standards
even the face of newer more powerful
equipment Mart phones like the HTC 10
it's no surprise that it's still
utilizing the latest and greatest from
Qualcomm scamp the Snapdragon 820 paired
with the generous 4 gigabytes of RAM and
the audrina 530 GPU both are pretty
smooth with basic operations but it'll
be intriguing to see how they stack up
with graphics processing things get a
little interesting as we look at their
software as Google's interpretation of
the Android experience is showcased in
full form by the Nexus 6p it's clean
direct and logical with its layout but
you know it's going to receive the
latest updates of Android faster
HTC on the other hand does
few nice things to simplify the latest
sense uy experience you might take fancy
in its peculiar style which of course
offers users even more personalization
with the addition of stickers we also
can neglect to point out
HCC's impeccable track record of getting
its devices of today if there was a
phone that totally wowed many by its
performance it has to be the Nexus 6
piece twelve point three megapixel
camera it showed us that cameras don't
need beefy megapixel counts most
surprising though is that it manages to
do even a handy job under low light
as for HTC's newest flagship they're
reimagining the ultra pixel camera it's
a 12 megapixel camera with a wide F 1.8
aperture lens and 1.5 5 micron size
pixels now all this making the team over
at HTC a little bit excited see that
there's a strong emphasis with low-light
performance if there's one area where
the Nexus 6p is untouchable it's none
other than pricing at $500 outright and
unlock the Nexus 6p makes a statement
like no other just because it undercuts
the pricing of most flagships you'll get
the savings with the next 6p especially
when you look at the $700 costs attached
to the HTC 10 yes its price higher but
there are a lot of reasons why HTC's
champion might be the superior one time
will tell if that's true or not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
