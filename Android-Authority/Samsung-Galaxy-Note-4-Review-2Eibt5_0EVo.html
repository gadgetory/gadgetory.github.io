what we might be witness to here is
Samsung truly establishing what is their
flagship smartphone line hey it's Josh
regard from Android authority what's
going on everybody and yes here is the
full review of the Samsung Galaxy Note 4
what a difference a little metal makes
undeniably the first thing you'll notice
about the note 4 is it shine across the
frame an aluminum frame provides an
incredibly sleek addition to the
returning Foley there backing that no
longer has the fake stitching all around
the frame is basically flat all around
with just a tiny bit of rise near the
top and bottom corners those flat sides
curve inward to the panels and in this
dark edition of the phone the shine is
simply eye-catching all of the usable
tropes returned with the signature
tactile home by now with the fingerprint
scanner embedded and it is flanked by
back in recent apps capacitive keys that
are noticeably underneath a striped
design found underneath that 2.5 D glass
the S Pen is nuzzled in the bottom right
corner as always and a return to the
conventional microUSB charging port on
the bottom is accompanied by the
headphone jack up top the faux leather
backing provides the kind of texture
that grips to the palm making this a
comfortable phone to use despite its
larger size and there's no way around it
this is simply the prettiest phone
samsung has ever made certainly true
when considering the note line
specifically even if it might look like
another note device to everyone else you
as the owner will know by the subtle
reflection of the 2.5 D glass and the
shine of the metal frame that this is
the wonderfully designed Note 4 that you
own and you're going to love knowing
that I've mentioned 2.5 D glass a couple
times already and that is only one of
the big enhancements in the note display
game in the case of the note 4 it is
kind of a return from the Samsung Galaxy
s3 the 2.5 D glass is basically the kind
of glass you'd see on most high-end
watches these days slightly thicker and
raised up but it slopes downward on all
sides
but underneath the surface is a big
upgrade to today's hot screen flavor
quad HD the super-high resolution helps
this large screen still achieve over 500
pixels per inch which leads to a great
sharpness in text and as usual the high
saturation
contrast of the Super AMOLED display
brings the kind of experience any
Samsung user comes to expect colors that
really pop out and punch you in the face
viewing angles are stellar making the
screen look like a sticker at times and
the white balance in the camera might
make the color seem a little bit bluer
in this screen but rest assured that if
Super AMOLED is your thing
highly vivid and highly contrasted Media
will follow and you will be very pleased
by it so doesn't really matter that the
note 4 has a super high resolution
screen after all there is still a very
apparent lack of applications that fully
take advantage of it you can find the
difference if you look hard enough and
it is there but for plenty of general
users out there you're pretty much going
to just enjoy the great experience that
is on here no matter what you think
about quad HD and now you can be sure
that the best performance possible is
accompanying the new note for the
Snapdragon 805 with the Adreno 420
backed by three gigabytes of RAM now
this is the configuration that my
specific model has but a beefed up
exitos
octa-core setup can be found in the
alternate model but no matter how you
slice it there is raw power in this
phone and there has to be given
Samsung's pension for incredibly
saturated software experiences that
being said the experience on the note 4
is best described as TouchWiz at its
most fluid thus far that's not to say
there aren't any moments of stutter or
lag as I'm sure many of you will be
hypersensitive toward but I've had tons
of applications running at once I've
blown through multiple multitasking
scenarios and I've been able to play
some great games with that much incident
at all as far as Samsung is concerned
this is the best performance experience
they've managed to put out which
shouldn't be much of a surprise you
might be able to find more fluid
experiences out there but the margin
between them shouldn't be very large at
all and in Hardware Samsung continues to
push the envelope with its offerings in
the note line the Aspen has been beefed
up but other additions have found their
way to the note 4 as well the most
glaring one is the new heart rate
monitor found squarely on the back the
application of health monitoring via the
s health application is an individual
matter but at least the HRM can be used
for other purposes now like as the
shutter release for the camera
personally I'm not a big user of
Samsung's flavour of fingerprint logging
but nonetheless it's a feature that has
arrived
in outline now all other expected bits
and pieces are here call quality was
expectedly good but despite some decent
volume in the speaker setup its rear
mounting still puts it at just average
performance the removable back cover
allows you access to a replaceable
battery which comes in at 32 20 milliamp
hours that's not a big upgrade from the
battery capacity of the note 3 but even
with a higher resolution screen and all
of the power underneath
I found battery life to be where it
should be for a large device in
particular one day of heavy testing
brought the phone down to single digits
in about 14 hours and if you were using
power saving features especially the
ultra power saving you should usually
get a day and a half out of the note for
possibly quite a bit more so
optimizations went into ensuring the
battery life didn't at least go down a
lot but Samsung made sure to add an
important feature fast charging using a
nine volt charger in lieu of the
conventional five volt charging adapters
Samsung claimed that battery life gets
to 75% under just half an hour of
charging now that wasn't really the case
but their secondary claim was true full
charge in about 100 minutes while that
might mean having a specific charger or
adapter on hand at all times the ability
to go from 0 to work ready in a short
amount of time will undoubtedly be an
indispensable tool for plenty of users
as it was for me multiple microphones
have been added on to help with the
voice calls and in the quality it seems
to work but they are also there for
voice recording which now can be used in
an app to segregate specific portions of
this sound spectrum it's a nice feature
but ultimately it's not really useful
for anything more than reference audio I
see interviewers taking advantage of it
most because students can't even really
have their phones out in class to record
lectures anyway and we finally make it
over to the s-pen which doesn't carry
with that many changes from the previous
model at least physically but
enhancements in the experience probably
make this one of the most useful Suites
for the stylist yet higher sensitivity
allows for even better stroke
sensitivity in the S note application
which means new pens a new smart select
feature lets you cut apart specific
sections of your screen for easy access
later and perhaps the most useful
addition is the ability to hold down the
button on the pen to easily do
selections across the system like
dragging a mouse in order to do
selections on
pewter by far the pen as mouse features
the one I see people using most as I
found myself pulling the pen out for
just that very purpose
because holding that a finger and then
trying to do my selections accurately
it's just not the business anymore even
if the other capabilities of the S Pen
might not prove useful later on I think
doing selections easily like this will
never go stale and now we make it over
to the camera which brings with the
optical image stabilization we've been
waiting for on top of the 16 megapixels
of power a more open aperture should
allow for better low-light shots and
this is true for both the rear-facing
camera and the front-facing 3.7
megapixel shooter key modes return from
previous iterations like live HDR and
the selective focus but a few selfie
centric modes are now available as well
when using the front-facing camera a
wide selfie mode allows you to move the
camera in panorama fashion yielding a
120 degree angle to fit in all of your
friends but if you want to use the rear
shooter for your selfies a face
detection mode helps achieve that though
the focal length is definitely more
narrow so you have to keep that in mind
4k video capture is possible and its
quality is actually quite good getting a
good amount of detail though the file
sizes can be very high picture quality
continues the tradition of samsung
quality with pictures exhibiting very
high saturation which means vivid photos
though not necessarily too accurate to
the actual color low-light shots those
suffer as expected but the optical image
stabilization yields a better photo in
the note 4 than any Samsung phone that
went before without it shooting photos
with the camera app is actually a pretty
fast affair with processing time only
getting long one in low-light situations
or when using special modes otherwise
it's pretty easy to get a shot off and
you will likely get a pretty good
looking shot and finally TouchWiz
returns in the Galaxy Note 4 with
further enhancements not only with the
s-pen but also in multitasking we
already went through the s-pen updates
but the S note application has been
given one very powerful addition the
photo notes the application will go as
far as morphing surfaces taken at an
angle in order to capture any text on
that surface which then can be converted
into lines that are erasable and
replaceable using the s-pen opening up
true and creative editing Samsung's own
version of the second screen comes back
to it is now called briefing it is still
basically a big Flipboard widget but
it's designed as much easier
on the eyes now and actually makes
scrolling through the newsfeeds bearable
and actually looks really nice
unfortunately the briefing is still very
curated with no room to pick custom
feeds you can select from a limited
amount of categories but that's about it
and finally we come to the multitasking
capabilities which have been heavily
bolstered multi-window has been given
center stage with a new icon that is
found at in a redesigned recent apps
screen press this button and you'll
launch right into the dual window
holding the back button still brings up
the familiar list of compatible
applications which continues to grow but
tapping on any of these apps will bring
up a floating window that brings another
level of multitasking you're able to go
from here to a floating icon that can be
put aside and large the floating window
to be full screen again or drag it up or
down to once again create the multi
window combination the final but
flashiest element added in is the drag
down from either top corner when using a
compatible application it will shrink
down to a floating window which you then
can perform any of the transitions to
multi window or floating icons that
we've already talked about to your
heart's content this seamless movement
from one multitasking method to another
really shows the power of this version
of TouchWiz and even if you don't really
use multi-window or floating apps the
ease of use just might convince you to
try it more often I have always said
that TouchWiz with it's generally
bloated elements even after its recent
aesthetic revamp looks better on larger
screens and it is still true here
especially with the higher resolution it
all seems to fit quite well and honestly
I haven't wanted to install another
launcher yet if there are a bunch of
features that you already were not using
in previous Samsung iterations then
that's not a whole lot is going to
change when you use the note 4 but the
focus on multitasking and the new
additions in the s-pen I believe
actually might survive what I call that
galaxy syndrome the Samsung Galaxy Note
4 will be the premium offering across
all contracts and carriers and the off
contract price will be at least $700
which is no surprise for a high-end
smartphone though the LG g3 and the Oppo
find 7 comes to mind as competitors due
to their quad HD displays much of the
talk will likely center around the
iPhone 6 plus as the main large form
factor competition don't worry a full
comparison will be underway soon to see
how all of these stack up
updates to high-profile smartphone
flagships generally get a lot of buzz
but lately the excitement has been
waning and due in no small part to the
fact that small steps or what we get
where we thought we were going to get
big leaps in the case of the Samsung
Galaxy Note 4 we might not be seeing
giant leaps forward for the note line
but the steps taken were the right ones
Samsung has figured out design and
crafted one of the most attractive
phones I've seen quad HD was the
expected step forward in display but
they've managed to make the battery life
still on par while adding fast charging
to get you back to work quickly optical
image stabilization finally arrives here
and then TouchWiz focuses once again on
multitasking this time providing a
seamless experience that should make
multitasking easier for a lot of users
and finally the s-pen continues to be
the unrivaled note lines marquee
companion further bolstered by
capabilities that make a number of once
menial tasks much easier now the number
of enhancements that have proven
exciting and ultimately useful is longer
than in any past release samsung or not
and that's what makes the note for such
a great phone in almost every respect
the note 4 ups the ante not only for
note veterans but also for anybody
looking for an attractive package and an
upgrade to a larger display or to a
stylus experience with this fourth
iteration in its note line samsung has
truly established which phone is their
true flagship and that is why it gets
