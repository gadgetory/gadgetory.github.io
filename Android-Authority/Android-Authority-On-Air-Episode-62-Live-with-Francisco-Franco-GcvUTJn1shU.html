original android
show on google+ I'm dare cross I'm Scott
Anderson and I'm gay Charlton and we are
joined with special guest Francisco
Frank who you may recognize from various
apps on the Play Store as well as
kernels for android or xda-developers
Francisco thank you for joining us hi
guys thanks for having me if you're a
fan of the show you may recall we
actually had Francisco Frank on here
about a year ago he was on the fifth
episode of the show so it's it's been a
while since we had him on here last time
he was on here with us we talked about
his ever increasingly popular kernel
which I called franco.kernel and then
found out that I was pronouncing his
last name incorrectly it's just now and
we had a nice laugh laugh about it and
we also talked about android 4.0 point
for because it had just came out so a
lot has changed since android 4.0 point
4 and the original franco.kernel updater
app since then he has added a free
addition to his app which we'll talk
about here a little bit he has added
support for more devices more kernels
obviously has new devices have come out
more the past year um he has added a
nexus 4 display control separate app as
well as a simple CPU it monitor
extension for dashclock widget so if
you're on Android 4.2 in your rock and
dashclock widget because everybody
should be using that because it's
awesome I should check out his his
extension for it and he also has a
simple reboot app if you're wrong that
you're running doesn't have a reboot
bootloader and recovery so stuff like
that so Francisco once again welcome to
the show it's great to have you here we
have a bunch of questions lined up for
you and those of you that are watching
live or listening live there on google+
or youtube if you have any questions
about any of his
apps um why he's awesome or anything
like that feel free to go ahead and drop
a comment and we will be watching for
those comments and we'll add the
question to the cube so uh feel free to
ask away yeah please do okay so starting
off uh what devices do you support for
your cuddles um I know it's a list since
the beginning or just only now corelle
how about now okay so now as a Galaxy
Nexus Nexus for the nexus 10 and the
Nexus 7 so everything inside the Google
ecosystem basically then Nexus yeah okay
um what what are some of your steps that
you go through when you conceptualize a
nap like how does it come to be oh
that's a hard question because I haven't
made that many apps um yeah made one a
while so I guess let's say why why did
you get into developing your most
popular app is obviously your Colonel
updater app so what why did you decide
to to to update their to to add that and
you know continue adding features to it
and so forth um probably because I
wanted people to flash the Colonel's
easily without the problem of rebooting
to the floater or going to distribute
recovery so they just one click two
clicks most and done and most people
just don't go over to XDA developers to
check if I have a new version and they
can just open an app and see whoa a
generic version so let's one click and
have it see the change log there and
asshole free and you I right now it's
great but it's been evolving for a while
but try to follow the Google guidelines
so it's easy for everyone even geek or
non-geek so and it helps a lot people to
manage their their actual colonel
options because I've been adding stuff
for
for a while and all my other vices and
it's kind of hard to keep track of all
the other paths to go geek mode and
shell and type it all even I don't know
anything every path from my out of my
head so using the app works and people
like it for that because it's just easy
and it works ok I just wanted something
that people will recognize that be
helpful and they would actually use it
every day ok and I use it every day so
I'm my main customer myself I made it
for myself than the other people
enjoying what I like to do so that's
probably the biggest reason making stuff
that I would leave first and then give
it out for free or or not so depending
on them I want to work out ok um I
believe I remember what your favorite
device was when we last spoke now that
you know new devices have been released
what's your daily driver what's your
go-to device oh my god i'm not sure i
can say what what's my deal with driver
it's not secret stuff with that I better
not say it but well I remember talking
about the galaxy s3 year ago when you
were last on the show and you said if i
remember correctly it was quote-unquote
 you had a bunch of problems with
that device you and about other people
it's not very developer-friendly anyway
but my my day with driver it's the nexus
for it the best advice ever I've ever
used I'm very happy with it and I I saw
the galaxy s4 today and besides the
awesome screen I'm not going to change
because I was google's experience and i
use build quality that's iphone like the
nexus 4 and just works in my opinion and
I kind of like building code for for
this chip because cocom it's big free
free open source and so the code is good
it's clean for a lot a Qualcomm squad
has gotten a lot better
has 18 months or so yeah I believe so
they're getting bare in CODIS well that
documented the comments are extensively
documented and it's easy to go around
and change it and make it better if I
want to um I'm sure we go down to change
this sometime soon it is okay um another
question uh do you plan on I know that
you make apps for rooted devices and for
like a specific demographic do you plan
on making any apps for the general
public something that doesn't require
root something that anybody really on
any device could download and use from
yeah probably right now I don't have any
any plan but I've been thinking and
thats might be might be go for the next
six months for maybe six months one year
we'll see what happens when and I'm done
with my training or the place order I
mean or the moment after that I'll have
time for for the loving something out of
the Nexus range or all of the routine
Colonel stuff because that's good
experimental for it I think I know the
answer no I'm so sorry yeah no that's
and that's not its I'm not saying it's
not gonna happen with its ninety ninety
nine percent on it's not going to
anything I'm if somebody buys your
device if someone gives me the device
like okay I give you this can you do it
I would do it but I'm not going to waste
my own resources for something I when I
won't use first I want to enjoy a second
and that I don't have any particularly
enthusiastic yeah yeah I'd have I do
against the offer to let people buy one
for you because people will end up
taking you up on that offer and then
you'll end up supporting 25 devices and
burn it out yeah it's more having their
I had six devices with at some point and
it's it's impossible and and that time I
was doing only this of my wife
and I decided okay it's impossible it's
very hard and some how I would forget
that one and because it's really hard
even now the nexus 10 at the moment it
is the one I've been working less
because I enjoyed it so much and haven't
need to change stuff there and yeah I
don't want able to get upset with me
because I just stopped supporting
something so better not to support then
after then actually drop it and I did
that I had to drop for two devices and
that wasn't very funny and people of
course they get mad but I'm human yeah
that I see I'm human I can do it
everything it's very hard yeah another
question from YouTube regarding the hot
plug the recent hot-plug implementation
what is the current development on it
what are their plans to improve it what
okay general yeah I'll give a general
general thing so almost everyone knows
but Qualcomm devices she put something
called MP decision it's like a user
first binary the takes care of that uses
the power hole and the socket interface
to communicate with the colonel in user
space and well it kind of works it
divides it's very smooth but i think the
car management is poorly done off goes
online i'll find too much for no reason
and at that same time it manages the
frequency of the cpu we touch the screen
goes to maximum you the other cars go up
so you get throttled reason you can see
all the reduces nexus for all the rivers
hello he's getting hot and the
benchmarks really low because of the
minute that so that aside i used
something else I used the outflow
drivers from a guy called will for a
while but I wasn't very happy with it
and I like one month ago I decide to
write my own from scratch and my what I
want basically it is maximum you I
smoothness
basically just making at least two
course online and walking them up until
the interactivity is done so you still
have all your smooth and that's
connected to the interactive governor I
made some hooks around so the
interactive tunable scale scale based on
load automatically so that's kind of
awesome and it locks the frequency speed
to a certain level as well so and then
if the load is really big for some
samples it points out for course and
these they'll keep using the four course
until that what it's done for simple few
gaming using MP decision from coke on it
goes online offline too much and I have
a very smooth experience or you don't
and now there's a bunch of people that
run tests for me on the threads on XDA
developers and we got more than five
frames per second increase on some games
compared to more stock experience and
gangs like beach buggy blitz or whatever
the name is and are five frames per
second increase six GTA GTA rod so at
this point I'm very happy with it
battery life is great everyone is happy
it's very configurable you can change
all the thresholds for all the levels so
I marry have with this right now my goal
from here is add some thermal throttling
capabilities of the driver because right
now I'm only decreasing the speed of the
CPU if the gets hot but of course
they're online they'll keep online so
what I'm going to do now is take two out
but don't decrease the Freak we see that
much so that keeps the balance and the
games benefit more from actual
frequencies and from course online so
that you'll probably have a little bit
well I have a few ideas about what
frequencies I want the CPUs to jump in
when they go on one instead of going
from the minimum to somebody else so
active reading the code and I'll
eventually find something that can be
improved so those are the two two things
I'm I'm more into it I got a lot of
fourth feedback from the community all
the time so I
of that I think everybody feelings
anyone's watching and I was that so
that's constructive criticism am always
open for that all the time and I read I
read everything so I am power mode
presets for the nexus 4 when are they
coming similar very sooner than I trust
him okay I was always kind of waiting
for for this milestone to come which
count came the four days ago probably
and I was waiting for that and that
comes for the neck I'm going to make
them just for the Nexus 7 and the make
nexus 4 really soon like a few days from
now very baby in the weekend after the
weekend so that's yeah and I'm going to
change all that interface sooner as well
because he needs to be more powerful so
okay and then for your um your uh
there's a feature called system monitor
it's basically a nap disintegrated you
want to talk a little bit about that
sure i'll be very happy to talk about so
my best friend called christian he
decided to make a an app called system
monitor to actually monitor every thing
about your device in the awesome looking
UI using you in the new guidelines from
google and since i'm friends with him
and they decided to make a free app i
decided to be talked and I integrated
the free part on my app so that people
would have the benefit of enjoying the
free part on my app and if they're like
that every 5-6 times they would open
open that option I would open the
dialogue there and say look at this half
is from that developer if you like it
you can purchase it so it's like a trade
back but I'm very interesting you know
idea cuz you're obviously a successful
you know developer I'd like to I'll call
you that I'll go out you know and i'll
put my neck out there and say that you
know you're doing a hell of a job in
making kernels and then your updater app
so you're giving new little guys you
know that are just getting in in
to developing or that aren't well known
a chance to have to have access to a lot
of a lot of people you know that that's
awesome you don't really see that I
can't think of can't that be done
anywhere before well that was my big
goal and I wanted to get him known
because i love the app I I think
everybody should buy it I use it every
day for the features some features I I
suggested to him and hit although job
anyway but some features we kind of
talked so oh it's good that people get
to know the app I can show you a bit of
the app if that's okay yeah yeah go
ahead and bring it up here on your tab
at all focuses crazily there this is my
my nexus 4 so you can see it's
monitoring all the four cores three are
online so you can see all the load the
graphics here so this is the full full I
by the way so those of you that are
watching later or listening on
soundcloud and aren't actually watching
live he's actually demonstrating right
now on screen what what the system
monitor app actually looks like and how
it functions yeah so this is the full
app you see on top of everything there's
a small window there that's the
something i want to call fine monkey but
the real neighborhoods it's very much
just the stupid Emma I figured one day
and stick between us but that real name
for it is fine monster it's like all the
graphics and about the CPUs and they go
online offline so below it's at the rare
manager that Iran monitor this is the
network or you why I countries from here
I 0 dis graphics is she this is network
and this is the top applicants you can
see it's a bunch of stuff you can see
here besides this is also battery
prediction great it's a great algorithm
there's so many stuff that you monitor
your device that everybody would be very
dump not buy this I'm sorry it's a very
full featured app right so so I have a
question for you Francisco so you're
obviously doing something that
i think is pretty noteworthy pretty
revolutionary because yeah I don't see
it done a lot you're giving a new
developer a chance to reach a lot of
people are you going to extend that
offer in the future to other developers
and if so how can somebody enroll in
this new program how can someone contact
you to do this Oh for hit me an email
and we can talk about that surely if
that works for me I don't want to sound
selfish but of course it has to work to
me oh yeah make sense yes it's not so if
someone pitches you like an angry birds
clone you know you may not include it
you know yeah sure of course the Hat if
that works for me it ends for my users I
mean when I talk about me to my users if
the talk it's for source for them it's
something we can work out like I worked
out with in which way does it was like
two minutes conversation and we were
done but anyway if you had someone wants
to and thinks it's useful for everybody
in I can help with that for mini melon
okay we have a bunch of additional
YouTube comments and we're going to put
those on hold for a little bit we're not
ignoring them live and pinned here in
the queue we'll get back to him a little
bit so you can still go and ask any
question you want to hit up Francisco
for but I have a question for him about
developing and in general you know
you've been you know at least a year
maybe longer you know you've been a
little bit more about developing a free
Android you know app absent and kernels
so you're you're were versed in how
Android works where do you see Android
going and then in the future you know
what where is it where where do you see
it going changing in and taking on you
know new devices new shapes and forms
that's an interesting question I haven't
thought about it um I think it will be
more person or Intel or social oriented
if you see all the news from the past
that messager battle stuff for example I
know that the next version you'll have
something called a game center as well
so something like I'd iOS so I haven't
seen seen it but I know it's going to
come so yeah we go freely so well so
what about could you see yourself you
know there's rumors that a SmartWatch
from google is going to be that Google's
working on a SmartWatch let's say that
that that that is true and they put out
a watch because you in let's say it's
open for developers to hack and slash a
kernel for could you see yourself
developing in kernel for that or maybe
Google glass and wearable tech would you
consider doing that in the future if
there's avenues became available well I
must refer messing with Colonel those of
us it's intelligent because you want
them to work all the time you're not
actually going to debug stuff on the
Google glass or debug stuff from your
want him to work so I trust Google will
do their good job making kernels for
them and I'm not so sure I would want to
mess with that because we want to see
your time when your watch and we don't
want you to reboot so I exited I see
myself making making making apps for
them but about having your phone beyond
stables okay is what you're saying sure
yeah I got on other phones yeah doesn't
mean doesn't mean it's unstable but but
it can happen yeah it's good I'd rather
have my phone crash than my igoogle last
and I'm driving I'm seeing the direction
to go to in a further and wants that
burger so much that it's true I don't
know where I am when they get that
things are scratched that took me funny
no ever done no that's that's my take on
but that's absurd okay i click questions
um shout out i'm a nexus guy i have
nexus 4 using your latest 134 colonel it
loves it HTC one getting the colonel no
sono okay
oh you see for me nor never would you
ever consider the ceilings another one I
would you ever consider sony support in
the future I haven't but I like well the
way they're going right now okay I like
the latest one the Z maybe this is a
yeah yeah it's it's not there yet but
you know I can hear if they keep doing
what they're doing if I like the device
sure somebody wants to know the name of
the app that you just showed us it's
called system monitor just system
monitor yeah really just offers name is
Christian glutes golder yeah exactly
that yeah okay are you going to Google
i/o unfortunately no I couldn't get a
ticket Darren are you going you didn't
buy one in the like 60 seconds that were
on sale I couldn't it was impossible
yeah I decide to get 19 was unable to as
well but that's okay I I will spend my
money elsewhere on glass here hopefully
in a few weeks never I get my invitation
email and but i'll be going to the BBQ
you you you know you're supposed to go
the big Android BBQ last year my friend
and you living a clean because of the
the visa busters yeah I know but hey you
know what you you're now in the u.s.
you're already here you don't have to
worry about any that crap true getting
mr. in the States getting her how does a
lot easier so I will so I will drink
beer with you a lil BBQ I know about
android stuff it's not all about
drinking beer no it's actually all about
drinking beer yeah that's even better
alright so let's talk let's put Franco
all the things on hold for a little bit
if we have some time at the end we'll
come back and hit him up with some
questions about and development his apps
kernel development they've been talked
about system monitor for another bit but
let's say we want some Android ecosystem
stuff Dan yeah so uh IDC who's a company
that does a lot of different statistics
reporting on industry trends put
together the latest numbers for the
three months of 2013 so that's q1 2013
for tablet shipments and they're
estimating that just under 50 million
49.2 million tablets shipped there is
this us or worldwide I still no
statistics though I don't know I think
those are just us statistics I'm gonna
go out on a limb I honestly don't know
that's yeah they seem low for global uh
but the big news there is that twenty
seven point eight million of those were
Android devices and only nineteen point
five million i patch it really doesn't
matter if it's us or global we really
care about the percentage of here like
it did yeah that's true so Android raked
in fifty six and a half percent of the
market compared to apples 39.6 compared
to the first quarter of last year where
those numbers were almost exactly the
opposite with Android getting 39.4 a nap
while getting 58.1 so the tides have
really shifted like Davis it you know
from a year ago where Android you know
arrow was it you know almost 40% and now
apples almost 40% I mean it's that
that's amazing in a year turnaround time
how much they grew yeah no that's that's
an incredible growth by Android
meanwhile the others category which I
had to assume includes windows but
probably other do uh went from
one-and-a-half percent last year to a
massive three-point-nine percent this
year so hey that includes the blackberry
value what that thing is called yeah
this library whatever it was the HP
TouchPad the different photos RT tablets
for 2013 but not so much for last year's
numbers but yeah this means that really
Microsoft really is selling some of
those things yeah or so perfect at least
one or two of them uh you know what then
um when these numbers came out then a
lot of people were so when a lot of the
one of these numbers came out of a bunch
of blogs in Silicon Valley and tech
blogs we're saying hey look samsung lost
to Apple Apple
sold more devices in San and Samsung
they weren't saying that Android was
sitting at fifty-six percent in iOS was
a 39 they looked at the actual
manufacturer selling these device that's
because a lot of the writers are on the
payroll of Apple still Apple is
notorious for paying bloggers to write
favorable about Apple commentary so when
something is not favorable for Apple
like oh god we lost twenty-five percent
of the market in a year ah so the story
becomes oh yeah but you're still beating
samsung so it's totally fine yeah
typical pro apple media yes so what
Francisco what do you think about the
tablet market share and Android you know
gaining 25% he's seeing a lot of new
users for the nexus 7 Nexus 10
downloading your Colonel fish sure um
they have been doing that but well I
have the two nexuses I still think the
iPad as an edge over android because I'm
still not buying the UI that Google is
made for for tablets it's not optimized
enough in my opinion and while I don't
use my iPad anymore because i use my
nexus 10 I think Apple still has to be
thing over over talat and iOS lovers or
Android lovers can see whatever they
want that is the vice cause you know a
little bit more too maybe that's why
it's gaining twenty-five percent you
know the UI might not be a hundred
percent but when you the price helps but
the Prairie helps the nexus 7 press
helps a lot then people which is it but
it's easy to to buy one to trash it and
be found it and you if you lose it it's
okay it's chip if you lose a ipad oops
yeah yeah do you think that the edge
that you see in the ipad versus the
android tablets do you think that's
inherent to the operating system or do
you think its ecosystem based I think
it's all bit of both to be honest I
think at the end hardware especially on
an iPad I think it has open
over even the nexus 10 GPU struggles a
lot to make that happen that a big
resolution to repair the chip in the
nexus 10 it's kind of unimpressive it's
not that bad I still I think they should
have gone to a different GPU and like a
good like I thought the one found for
the ipad 4 could have got there grab
together and made a cortex a8 their team
when they plan to about eight months
earlier than that yeah but the software
I think end road is to UM prepares for
towel test is it true it is my opinion
yeah so alright so so let's uh let's see
maybe if Android is you know unprepared
for tablets maybe we'll find out some
new stuff at Google i/o which is in two
weeks and there's a lot of speculation
right now you know are we gonna see
Android 4.3 when I see babble know
there's there's you know we're going to
see something awesome coming with chrome
and Android but I'm going to connect
some dots for everybody here I'm going
to draw some lines and throw some stuff
at a board and see what happens so
looking back over all right wait are you
gonna pull a samsung yeah bro 900 every
idea ever had I'm not gonna give
everybody like 50 different ideas and be
like I'll see look i called it you know
i'm gonna give him i'm gonna give my one
speculation on something I think is
coming and we'll see if i'm right or
wrong here in two weeks so we know that
android gaming a game center was found
in the myglass android app a couple
weeks ago who thanks to a tear down by
android police we saw an android game
center we saw was going to do all these
things that a game center should have
okay so that there's your first dot now
let's backtrack to about a year ago when
google gain or when google plus games
and chrome games were being talked about
a lot the one of the guys in charge of
the project said you know a year from
now so or something along the lines of
this we're not going to talk about
android games and chrome games and
google+ games we're just going to talk
about
Google games so we said oh look one day
out you know we're games are going to be
unified but you know it was just you
know off the top of his head type thing
you know there was no date there was no
firm saying we are definitely doing this
but it's like some day this might happen
now looking at looking back a few weeks
ago maybe a month or so ago maybe more
not one hundred percent sure on the time
frame but remember those that maze game
in the race game where you could hold up
your android phone or your android
tablet open up chrome go to a special
URL and then you could go to a special
URL on your desktop computer or laptop
and you could use your android devices
as a game controller and you could
control your the maze you control the
the characters running the race riding
the bike swimming and so forth so you
used your your phone as a gaming
controller and your TV or your monitor
was the big screen and you say that
there was chrome gaming and it was a
chrome experiment now it was all well
and good it was all fun and it was neat
but it you know it wasn't it you know
it's super super exciting it was just
something thrown together to make people
say oh wow that's cool but what if it
was testing the functionality of using
android using your phone using your
tablet as a game controller now google
has done things like this before those
of you watching on google+ right now
remember when hang out mustaches first
came out and everyone thought they were
the coolest things ever and then for
some unknown reason two months after
hangout mustaches came out and everybody
used them we got facial recognition on
Google+ photos huh and I remember making
a comment saying hey thank you hang out
mustaches and I remember getting that
comment plus 1 by few Googlers you know
and goog-411 for years was was used and
given away for free we know that is why
google has a better voice recognition
system than Apple does then Siri because
they date a mind speech for in use our
speech for years get building up their
system so Google does these cool little
things for
free all the time that you know and they
turn into something big now ingress
ingress ingress is in ingress is a game
that's fun but it's also data mining
everything we're walking around past
2mon to monuments we're walking around
at skin and Wi-Fi networks it's data
mining everything so ingress is doing
something more than more than just a
game so my point is is that Google does
this stuff all the time it wouldn't put
it past you know them too I wouldn't put
it past them to do this anyways back to
my conspiracy theory Google i/o this
year there's a lot of game stuff I mean
there's just a lot of gaming going on
talking about a lot of games one of the
major sessions is called hey look what
we did with web technology we build a
mat an MMO a massively multiplayer
online game with web technology you know
as a musical what's interesting to have
it Google i/o so there's a lot of gaming
stuff happening put all that gaming
stuff happening that we already know is
coming and then speculated to come and
then coming at some point and then we
say well you know competitors are
putting out all these little HDMI game
that are you know game sticks or who yes
putting out a gamecube in in nvidia so
all these companies are using android
for gaming and google isn't doing it you
know and Google hasn't said yes we were
doing this or yes we're we're aware that
this can be done now there's the Google
TV but people don't use that to gain and
Google TV quite frankly hasn't been a
hit it hasn't been it hasn't sold 100
million devices but you know what sells
100 million devices game consoles do so
Xbox please I I think I think that we're
going to see call it a gaming stick
caught and it doesn't really matter what
it is if it's a sticker it's a little
cube it does a little console I don't
care what the form factor is I think
we're going to see a gaming device a
piece of hardware be released and it's
it's going to be it's going to be you
know
Google's answer to what Samsung is
putting it out there with her they're
connected TV you know it's going to be
their answer to yeah it's going to be
their answer to all the other little
companies that no one's ever heard of
putting out hdmi tix for Android TV so I
could be crazy I could be wrong but I
make a bet on this I said I really think
that we're going to see a google gaming
system it's going to be a piece of
hardware and it's going to come out at
i/o so that's that's going to be how
Google takes over the living room it's
not going to be with Google TV Google is
going to take over the living room and
compete with xbox xbox foothold in the
living room and they're going to do that
with with Android another tidbit a
google TV developer on this on the on a
Google TV session description it's
called Android on your TV and in the
session and says something along the
lines of common see what's come and see
the new Google TV platform or come and
see the new platform for Google TV so
they're talking about something new it's
not google TV they're talking about
something new it's it's it's miracast
well said it could be miracast but you
said something big is going to happen
around games and it's going to be
hardware so miracast very well could be
it we're very well we miracast they
could be putting out a dongle you know
in it your custom yeah so bored of it
yes all right so close are interrupting
no no you you think it's gonna be a
mirac a stove ice um a dongle we're cast
yeah yeah and let's go going I kinda
seem going for something even bigger
right I think you're right probably
about most the gaming and the
implications of all of that but I see
that is just being one piece of the
puzzle not the whole puzzle in looking
at what they did last year with the
Nexus Q and they're really just kind of
trying to push the old Android at home
type you know thing I would agree with
Derek and they will support everything
on top of that game center that they've
been no me that's that's my boy yes it's
gonna be you know a full
systems at a media center a home it's
going to be doing your music streaming
your video streaming and gaming from
your next to the life exactly exactly
your gift using that yet yes yes yeah so
so let's see let's see if our conspiracy
theory is right I'd like to bet on it
but you know we don't we don't need to
gamble on air but maybe maybe off air
will set up a camel all right so so
let's talk about some apps you know
we'll see what happens at Google I own
two weeks when we cover that but for now
let's move on to some apps this week
such as okay with mr. kind of quick
wickets with the apps the carbon the
backup app data got renamed to helium
after a cease and desist from Carbonite
the file backup company through
small-time dev I would I assume that it
would be easier to get out of the way
rather than trying to back up the name
so yeah got changed um level of us
coming out on the periodic tables is
called carbon so I don't know how you
can yeah I don't know beautiful widgets
released a basic functionality app
allows you to have a free version which
is nice pretty cool I'm asked a lot it
like three years ago what set sucks for
all the people who bought it like three
years ago no its basic functionality is
not like everything no I know and then a
yahoo bought Astrid the to-do app that
is very popular and it's going to be
shutting down so these are those premium
users I'm sorry and then we got
microsoft released an android app that
repairs you too from switching to a
windows phone pretty much by lying to
you um yeah that's an interesting app um
Chrome Beta got updated a verizon cloud
Derek you want to elaborate
that a verizon cloud you know is
interesting um how well they're doing it
to compete with AT&amp;amp;T who already has a
backup cloud you know that that's why
they're doing it they're giving you five
hundred Meg of free space so you can
backup files your contacts your texts
your phone call history you know music
video pretty much almost everything you
can back up already with Android except
for your call history unless you're
using a google voice and your text
unless you're using google voice but
yeah um i think it's silly to duplicate
what's already available you know
especially when it's 500 Meg but
whatever if it floats their boat i keep
my data with google why I see it silly
but they're not doing it to compete with
Google they're not doing it to be like
hey look me too no they're doing it so
they can take advantage of uneducated
customers that's exactly what they're
going but you know hey here is to take
advantage of their customers no no
they're not doing it take advantage of
their customers it would be actually
been awarded they're doing it to make
money because they know that people will
buy it so that's what a company does
right way of taking advantage of their
cost because Google doesn't go out there
and advertise hey look back up infinite
contacts backup well back up all of your
20,000 songs they don't whenever you
install android forget your first
android phone it doesn't say hey look at
the five gig of storage you get you know
with your google down just for having a
google account you get 10 gigabytes of
email storage 25 or 20,000 songs five
gigabytes of drive storage yes no text
alert if you want go to photo storage
yeah so if give exactly photo storage on
google+ as long as it's not over 2048 x
2048 you get unlimited photo storage if
you if its public on google+ i think
it's open it if it's only oh no no no
unit time limited whatever you want as
much as you want yeah and so come on
that still dovetails into picasa which
is limited but
is gonna die and they're gonna yeah yeah
I mean you can't even go to the link
like it's nowhere to be found I'll take
it down well no it's hard to get to whoa
we'll get to that later so so yeah so
apps did we talk about switch to Windows
Phone you at anybody installed anybody
doing it don't do that that's all do
that yeah yeah so uh Microsoft I mean I
understand what day you know that no i
don't i can't we use them my way into
that one they're desperate I think it's
hilarious and in their desperate for
customers so feel free to installed and
see the six apps that are compatible
with Windows Phone I have a name for
Microsoft that usually call it but I'm
not sure I'm allowed to say 5 i'll go
ahead and say it live will Scott Oh
bleep it out it's micro that's yeah
it all right so uh let's talk about some
advices Scott quick question from
YouTube apple support future for what
colonel yeah that can't be done for
Apple the up fine sighs oh I said Apple
oh yeah oppo well I don't have the
device send me advice and the car a
similar to the nexus worse anyone no
work on it there you go you heard
it here showtimes hablo father father
yes for needs an oppo 55 and no HTC one
I don't give me that time he will return
that it so Scotty hit us up with some
device infos uh google files of patent
for smartwatch with touch pads on the
side wireless transceiver display
processor to touch pads on the side
bezel pinch zoom stretch possibly
scrolling I really hope they're just
filing for patents related to
smartwatches with the intention of
sitting on them and screwing Apple I
hope they don't actually I think they're
stupid I hope they get the patents just
to screw
they but they don't do that they don't
patently I don't a funny thing about the
galaxy s4 so spanish tennis player a
tennis star David Ferrer I said posted
on Twitter I'm so happy with my new
galaxy s4 setting up s health on my new
galaxy s4 to help me with training funny
thing is it was posted from twitter from
hype for iphone oops and well in the big
kicker is is that Samsung is a sponsor
of the Madrid Open where they were
playing so now looking now it's a big
that was a big PR fail samsung who's
also under investigation for paying
people to say bad things somebody now
get caught paying people to tweet about
nice things about the escort from an
iphone i play tennis for 10 years and
for real and that those guys claim clean
mountains as a training process they
don't need LPS else or x 0 or help them
with their training or I ask I elf
whatever they stupid whatever letter
they want to put in front of Israel I
just see this no I don't know uh let's
talk about some google glass news
because that's the latest craze and last
latest hype so there's a rumored twitter
app coming twitter for glass a few posts
were found to be similar how you could
see you know twitter for iphone where
you can see the client that people were
using on Twitter so we saw some posts
show up with twitter for glass and then
after everybody made a big stink about
it the post were deleted so nothing says
confirmed like petition lyst yeah you
know i don't understand why companies
don't just leave this up there you know
as soon as you delete it then you know
it's real but but hey you know what in
case it was accidentally deleted and
twitter for glass is not real that's
okay a talented developer has tweet
glass or glass tweet sorry a glass tweet
which does the same thing it's just not
official it allows you
to post from your timeline to Twitter
just like a week from now when Twitter
changes the API and breaks the app no
yeah or until it gets a hundred thousand
installs like Falcon pro and then you
can't get any more yeah um so we know
that glass is running Android rights
running android 4.0 point for really run
the answer yep it's running Android 4.1
for ice cream sandwich so there's some
neat things you can do with that such as
enable a DB and then sideload apps well
sandwich I said ice cream sandwich yep
surgery so a a developer decided to
publish an app called bulletproof and
what it is it's a lock screen for glass
because right now glass doesn't have any
type of isn't there's no way to lock it
so if I had glass sitting on my desk and
somebody came into my office and picked
it up and put it on they would just be
able to start looking at my personal
timeline yeah you know which you know I
mean that you're a lot of people going
to have glass on their head all the time
but still yes tons yeah so it's still
you know it should have a way to lock so
somebody can't look at your personal
information now there's a rumor that
Google's that you know coming out with
some type of lock themselves maybe it is
you know some type of a speech
recognition or something either way
something's something's coming but in
the meantime a developer uh put out an
app called bulletproof where it looks
like the android ICS or jelly bean
lockscreen it's actually not based off
that he wrote it himself it's all coated
from the ground up and you were you can
swipe on the touchpad left and right is
a gesture or you can tap the touchpad
and so you can calibrate you set up how
many swipes you know if you want to do
you know like left-right left-right tap
tap try to do the konami code or
something i don't know but uh you can
you can configure your own tap and it is
pretty cool so you want you had once you
have your your tap configured you you
you turn on head on detection if you
didn't already so the first time you
pick it up and you put it on your head
it says hey look it's now on the head it
turns on it it asks you for your lock
screen
code you swipe and tap you get off the
lock screen and then it doesn't ask you
for it again it's on your head it won't
ask you for it again until you take
glass off and then go to put it back on
so it knows once it knows when you take
glass off because of head on detection
so it's actually really cool but most
people are going to install that because
you have to install by atb and not it
but chances are the people that have
glass right now our developers and savvy
enough to do so um we had talked about i
believe last week briefly that they
doing an APK decompile and looking at
the code i was able to see that the
glass app glass gestures done EPK when I
decompiled it last week I saw that it
had wink gestures in there and there is
all sorts of code for setting up wink
gestures and for blinking or winking to
take a picture and you know how to
calibrate it and how to do all sorts of
stuff wit with winking and well Mike
being the talented developer that he is
he went out and develop twinkie which
Winky is just an app that you once again
you sideload by atb and all it does is
enable the native code that is in glass
already for winking to take a picture
and it's pretty cool you don't glass
doesn't need to be on right now to take
a picture you have to holding the camera
button you have to tap it or that's
option one you have to tap it and then
say ok glass take a picture or you have
to you know do your head wake you flick
back to wake up glass then you say ok
glass take a picture which is still a
hell of a lot better than reaching my
hand in my pocket pulled out my
smartphone doing my unlock pattern
finding the camera app you know so
that's still awesome but winking is
instant you know you you you wink boom
you take a picture and glass doesn't
even have to be turned on it's just on
your head so the screen can be off and
you wink and boom you take a picture
that's completely hands-free and it's
instant versus three seconds to you know
but it's good take a picture every time
I plate no no glass act it actually has
a whole bunch of a whole bunch of code
in it a really high performance
co2 to actually look when you're
actually doing a facial scrub when
you're actually scrunching your eye
closed not just a blank and it's based
on time lengths and everything it's
really sophisticated so it mean it from
from what Mike was saying it's it yeah
it's not going to you know confuse just
a little like maybe a bug in your eye
you're going like that it's not gonna
it's not going to do that it's not going
to take pictures then you have to really
you know maybe close your eye for a
second so you have to do the scrunch so
it's very cool obviously I don't have
glass haven't tried it but I've seen
Mike's demo video and and uh I think
it's awesome okay so this is a next
android version it's as far as like her
there it's going to be full of the
gesture stuff like just what you just
extra scratch that that's neat if so you
know if there's going to be all sorts of
gestures coming to mainline Android yeah
it's it's coming so well very cool right
so we couldn't help that well good I'll
take that is it unconfirmed report by
from one Frank by someone who's by
someone anonymous that is not on the
show right now um alright so let's talk
about some root and rom and stuff real
quick we'll try to wrap up here we have
about five minutes or so left so the HTC
one wil wheaton everybody knows own you
know Wesley Crusher a big big geek
superhero I guess he was having problems
last night routing his HTC one because
it's wallets an HTC phone and they're a
pain in the butt so he was able to
successfully unlock the bootloader but
he couldn't mount the partitions in
recovery to push super user data to
actually do the actual routing he
eventually got pissed off and gave up in
couche being the awesome guy that he is
came out with a special version of the
HTC One recovery called wil wheaton
recovery what it does is well if you can
get the recovery flashed it'll root your
phone for you you don't have to worry
about finding the partition or pushing
super user so it's a limited edition
only for the t-mobile HTC One and AT&amp;amp;T T
1 it reaches your phone
if you're not rooted so we flashed
recovery you boot the recovery you
select reboot from the menu and whenever
you go to reboot it says hey you're not
rooted yet do you want me to
automatically read this for you and it
does it and there's a picture of young
Wesley Crusher in the background I think
that's pretty cool um so uh remember see
I think if you're havin that much
trouble rooting your phone you probably
ought not oh he you know he said that he
you know when he was how the problems he
was having it made him miss his uh
Galaxy Nexus because that was a lot more
of a friendly device which is probably
true so speaking of developer friendly
devices remember up a few weeks back we
found out that cyanogenmod wasn't gonna
support the galaxy s4 um no we found out
that one developer didn't want to buy
the galaxy s4 and then bloggers around
the world blogspam saying cyanogenmod is
not supporting the galaxy s4 when in
fact was just one dude you know it was
me well maybe a couple people on his own
team hack song a couple people said they
aren't going to do it because it's a
pain in the butt and they're not doing
it but that doesn't mean the snapdragon
version isn't going to be supported and
that doesn't mean that you know sighs
and what isn't three or four people yeah
there's a greater 40 people on their
team yeah so Steve Kondik AKA cyanogen
posted on google+ an image of CM 10.1
running on the galaxy s4 already but
it's not but you know he titled it not
supported so uh take that with a grain
of salt so yes it is good there san
jamar gonna support it obviously i mean
it it's running cm 10.1 right now so
maybe the international version maybe
the octave isn't going to support it
maybe you know you can forget that one
that's for sure you don't think you
think that's a definite they won't they
won't work on Paxton's again trust me is
not a big fan of them anyway but
uh uh Dana Oh entropy entropy AKA Andrew
Dodd is extensively talked on Google+ my
posts about this and basically saying
that yeah it's a big pain in the ass and
he doesn't want to touch it so I agree
if you've heard the same thing the other
one they won't do it this is it it's too
painful it's not getting better and you
know what he basically basically said
that Samsung puts out code that says one
thing and then it doesn't match their
the compiled binaries like they're not
there there's a disconnect somewhere no
they put out code they can't compile it
does match wits in the device HTC does a
lot of us to wil wheaton is an alpha
geek i like that comment everybody knows
Wil Wheaton cuz we all love them you
know well however long ago up next
generation was on TV I know I did I
thought it was I thought it was awesome
but uh so any more questions for our man
Francisco hear about anything you want
to ask him what's his favorite color you
know go ahead and ask him he'll answer
no what's your favorite color I don't
know okay good answer good answer I
don't know the answer ah maybe the
correct answer should have been what's
the hex code for I for like hollow blue
like what's it yes that's what you
should be 4i v5e five I think there you
go there you go maybe I missed one or
two something that yeah it's close yeah
yeah this close to that all right well
uh real quick 30 seconds of patent news
dan go so the judge in the microsoft p
motorola case did something rather
unprecedented and set a friend wait
arbitrarily no other judges ever done
that before certainly not in the
district court level in addition to that
this is the same judge who overruled a
german court ruling because apparently a
judge in seattle has that kind of
authority um and is also basing his
entire ruling on the established
practices for patents that are part of
licensed patent pools the only problem
is the patents in at issue in this case
aren't part of a patent pool so his
entire legal basis is irrelevant ah in
more ridiculous patent there's judge koh
in the Apple v samsung case has ordered
a new trial for the damages and set the
date it's gonna be later this year
they're going to try and keep it short
two to three days and she brought all
kinds of restrictions on both sides um
though she's leaving an option for
samsung to appeal her decision again if
the USPTO makes a final decision on
Apple's patents validity between now
that the only problem there is the USPTO
already made its final decision Apple
can appeal that decision but their last
order is final that's why they called it
their final judgment okay so basically
she's saying oh well we are only going
to bother you know going back and
waiting if the USPTO comes out between
now and that and says yes these are
definitely invalid even though apple
says otherwise problem is the USPTO
could just as easily not care when Apple
submits their appeal had never bother
looking at it their invalidity still
stands so apparently being a judge in
America doesn't actually require you to
understand American law well we know
that there's there's always heat in
trouble surrounding patent laws and
patent so I'm sure it's not going to get
better until it is plenty of intelligent
judges like Posner or I can't remember
the name of the judge was on the judge
posture I like him yeah he took the time
to learn Java because the case was about
Java like hood man maybe I should
actually have a clue what all of these
people are talking about while I'm
sitting up your other batch yeah yeah
there are good judges out there but then
there's other ones like this you just
totally make crap up as they go along
that's obviously not legal
and then say oh no we are gonna wait
until the appeals court because then I'd
have to admit the fact that I've made a
ton of decisions that are obviously
going to get tossed on a deal to crazy
world out there yeah okay well uh Scott
won't you do your thing I uh you guys
