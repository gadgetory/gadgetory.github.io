tablet however after a couple great
smartphone offerings the time seems to
be ripe for a return to the tablet game
age Josh Vergara from Android thority
what's going on everybody and this is
the LG G pad it's not too hard to
understand where LG was coming from with
the design choices in the G pad in a
presentation at fo we were told that LG
wanted to provide as big a screen as
possible before extending too far from a
comfortable size and up front this
tablet certainly looks like it could be
a little too big but once you put in
your hand
it's possible to grip this tablet that
is almost 5 inches wide
indeed this tablet is set up almost like
a very large phone as the button layout
is very classical with power and volume
on the right in portrait a welcome
nuance of these buttons is that they
protrude just far enough for easy access
even when the tablet is laying on a
table whereas on other tablets they
might be tough to reach because those
are curved towards the back a headphone
jack is up top next to a covered slot
for microSD cards and in aesthetics the
white design wraps around the top and
bottom meant by a slab of aluminum in
the back this aluminum material is a
very welcome addition as it gives this
tablet a more premium feel than most
other Android tablets underneath the
rather simple looking camera optics up
top the bounds of the aluminum slab
house the 2 speaker grilles overall this
is a pretty attractive tablet seemingly
taking elements from different sources
to create one final product in the hand
it definitely is about as big as it can
get
it stretches my one hand during a grip
but not so much that I would dismiss
that kind of usage a nice touch is that
the bezels of the top and bottom of the
screen are large enough to rest a thumb
on making landscape usage a very
comfortable alternative to the portrait
mode that the G pad seems to keep
getting marketed with 8.3 inches was the
size LG went with for the screen and it
is capable of 1920 by 1200 resolution at
273 PPI now this is a very good spec for
a screen of this size making the G pad
able to handle HD and high quality
content quite easily this capacitive
screen does handle colors quite well as
they might not be too vibrant but are
definitely very far from dull deep
blacks give it a
good level of contrast and when it comes
to text sharpness is definitely no issue
one thing worth noting is that there is
a small black bezel around the rendered
user interface that somewhat adds to the
total bezel size it doesn't kill the
experience by any means but it is
noticeable ultimately this is a good
screen to use for movies or reading or
gaming in a size that actually does feel
just right so the spike hungry might
lament the G pad for not coming with the
fastest processing package as it comes
with the Snapdragon 600 clocked in at
1.7 gigahertz and is backed by the
audrina 320 and two gigabytes of RAM as
the optimist UI has grown to accommodate
a lot of multitasking these specs
definitely do the job I found no real
noticeable instances of lag in the UI
and putting apps aside for later usage
in either of the G pads ways of doing so
wasn't difficult at all if we use gaming
as a gauge my current obsession in dead
trigger 2 provides a good measuring
stick even when at high quality the game
still trucked along just fine without
much lag keeping me from killing all the
zombies effectively this might not be
the fastest package to be fair but the G
pad is definitely one of the fastest
tablets currently available aside from
the welcome aluminum material encasing
it all the G pad does come with some
nice extras 16 gigabytes of storage are
included bolstered by the micro SD card
slot available up top
connectivity sees the usual bevy of
bells and whistles though NFC is not
included an infrared transmitter allows
for the tablet to control televisions
and set-top boxes and for those of you
who want to use this tablet on your
carrier network and LTE version of this
tablet has popped up but currently it is
only available in Europe two speakers on
the back do make up a stereo setup but
since they're still on the back it
doesn't quite get across the sound is
good though but the best part is
definitely the loudness because this
thing can absolutely blast
as far as the battery goes you get a
forty six hundred million Bauer unit
within the G pad which is supposed to
provide up to nine hours of usage but in
my testing a typical task of watching
Netflix for two hours took the battery
from 85% all the way down to 50 percent
so in reality heavy usage might end up
getting you around seven hours which is
still respectable but definitely is not
exceptional on paper it's already tough
to get excited about this tablets camera
it doesn't come with a flash unit and as
a five megapixel shooter the camera app
is very similar to the g2 though it
doesn't come with intelligent auto a few
extra modes are available but ultimately
it comes down to the picture quality and
it's not great colors don't have any
real punch and sharpness is pretty low
routinely replaced by a level of grain
even in well-lit situations honestly
it's just hard to recommend this camera
for anything substantial unless it
really was the last one available and
finally in software the G pad stands to
benefit from the evolution of the
Optimus UI since the original Optimus G
all the way to the current g2 and in
that regard the tablet gets all of the
different cue functions listed pretty
squarely in the notification drop-down
you get a lot here qslide is the classic
function that gives you a good selection
of small overlay apps for quick
multitasking making memos is pretty easy
with either the small memo app or cue
memo which makes an editable screenshot
the main addition coming from the g2 is
the slight aside which is a way for you
to put aside whole apps for later usage
slide with three fingers over to the
left and it will slide the entire thing
away stack them up and then slide back
to the right and you'll be able to
select from the ones you've stacked it's
not the fastest multitasking we've ever
seen but it works fine just remember you
have to slide your app back into its
stack or you're going to have to do it
all over again in the G pad the newest
function is the cue pair which allows
you to join your smartphone and G pad
together via bluetooth while you can do
this with basically any smartphone it
obviously works best with the g2 set up
is incredibly simple just press the
buttons on either device and then get
them connected from here you are able to
use your tablet without needing to get
to your phone for every little thing you
can respond to texts decline calls and
even open the app you are using
on one device over on the other one it's
a nice way to consolidate your
experience between the smartphone you
always have on you and the tablet that
you often use overall the optimist UI
grows up pretty well
it might be a little too in-your-face
with everything that it can do but I
personally still like its utilitarian
take on Android at $349 the G pad sits
pretty squarely in the middle with the
price that isn't too low but with the
feature set that is pretty high quality
and so there you have it
All Things Considered it's a worthy
return to the tablet game for LG it
doesn't pack the fastest processor it
has an expected ly lackluster camera and
it doesn't have the most refined user
interface but in a parallel with its
design philosophy what you do get in the
G pad can definitely fit perfectly with
just what the general user may need
enough speed to game a pretty damn good
screen for watching your movies or
reading books and just enough tools
baked in to make the G pad and
assistance you may be proud to have as
always thank you guys very much for
