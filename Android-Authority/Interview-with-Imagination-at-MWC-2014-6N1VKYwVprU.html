by bitdefender mobile security hey guys
it's dark slack away here we're here at
imagination technologies and I'm here
with Alex Boyka he's a technology PR
executive with imagination and he knows
a lot of stuff about GPUs about mobility
so we're gonna pick his brain for that
GPU CPUs yeah you name it so why does
Apple continue to choose you you
mentioned that they're going to continue
licensing your technology yeah so
recently apple announced a trip we're
going to be continuing their
relationship with us on power vr video
and graphics continuing to use future
families of power of your graphics and
video for their associates historically
power VR start out in a desktop space we
had some design designs wins in the 90s
with desktop providers and console
makers but then we made this decision to
switch to mobile because we we saw that
the market was about to explode in
smartphones and tablets so i made this
conscious decision to sort of leave that
space behind and move to mobile because
we our architecture was inherently much
more efficient than traditional I'm are
immediately rendered based architectures
so our architecture is something called
dvd-r tile-based for rendering it's
probably the only architecture right now
GPU architecture that has this ability
to split the scenes into tiles and then
the fur rendering which means only the
visible pixels in a scene are actually
rendered next and this reduces
complexity it offers much better
performance and a lower power
consumption as well you know the analyst
from gardner and others they're saying
that we're going to be looking at 12 to
15 20 million units of these 3840 x 2160
displays the 4k displays you know on sub
10 inch nine inch 5 inch platforms
mobile devices with 4k resolution yeah
no some of the more bright people like
Johnathan Franklin shadow to you are
saying that is ridiculous and that you
know we don't have any screen SOC or no
GPU manufacturer or licensed or has the
technology to be able to sustain a
reasonable expectation of battery life
while we held a push-up smooth frame
rates for that kind of resolution and
we're talking about 2015 for this kind
of stuff so can you talked about that a
little bit yeah sure again part of your
today ships and devices with 4k screen
so we have smart tvs that have a range
of smart tvs that have our VR GPUs
powering the graphical you I handling
things like web rendering web browsing
rendering and so on so we're already
able to show that look Harvey R can
comfortably drive 4k displays but those
are those devices are usually smart TVs
not mobile not mobile yeah but that
doesn't mean that we don't have the
technology to be able to basically fit
that into something like a phone or a
tablet if a certain we em would would
want us to run to push in that direction
I mean it's pretty obvious that Apple is
going to I mean so we're looking at what
2048 x 1536 resolution on some of these
so we power of yarn has been the leader
in high resolution we were the first GPU
to be able to support at first when we
had HD resolution and then we went to
full HD and now we're kind of like start
moving towards 4k and in certain cases
and we've always been the GPU of choice
for people who want to have that high
resolution we have a certain range of
solutions that like I said are aiming at
the high end we've recently introduced
the GX 6650 which is a six cluster
design with 192 cores that's being able
to support the latest API so OpenGL ES
OpenGL opencl renderscript the full set
of mobile and embedded api's we believe
that's obviously going to be a real like
performance killer for
or everyone else we believe that it's
probably the best GPU design out there
at the moment and you know just one last
thing you know with reference to sort of
apps vs the web you know even on an
actual desktop legacy laptop or desktop
a lot of developers are at least not
developers but consumers are wondering
you know seeing demos of you know really
high intensity first-person shooters run
in the web browser and I'm wondering to
what end is this gonna be achievable in
a mobile sense you know and in terms of
standardization of OpenGL like you guys
are big proponents of that Apple works
with OpenGL really closely if you can
speak to that just a little bit I be
sure yeah sure I mean we've had
developers who've been developing some
content applications particular games
for the rogue architectures the latest
part of your pores and their feedback so
far has been that it's amazing they were
able to essentially that game that
you're seeing behind you actually is an
xbox 360 game with the assets of a
console game just poured it directly to
a mobile device and it just runs and
they were really impressed by the fact
that we're able to reuse all that
content they had from the desktop space
just change the API from a desktop to
mobile API which is minimal effort and
then it just works so we're seeing a lot
of the belt developers from unity or
epic and from EA companies that we have
close relationships with being really
amazed by how much they can achieve on
the latest part of your GPS really cool
so Audrina versus imagination caviar you
know versus Molly you know and obviously
versus Tegra k1 really in terms of how
much powers are consuming for how much
detail and complexity they're able to
put out what is the industry's best
solution what is the most leading
technology right now obviously its power
of you are but I'm just gonna quickly
back that up with some facts so for
example gfxbench Frank Ashanti recently
introduced this this term
hold long evolution a long term
evolution which is they essentially run
the benchmark 30 times in a row yeah and
then they measure the difference between
the initial run and the final one is the
heat yeah okay so we see that for power
V are the latest power vr course they're
able to smoothly maintain performance
there's no performance draw between
first one last one whereas everyone else
unfortunately has different different
drops but they all have jobs and
performance interesting and we believe
that's a unique advantage that is
obviously because it's a real
application we can obviously see that
happening in games or web browsers
anything that uses a GPU the graphical
UI and that's just one fact yeah how you
can easily back that up and say look
this is a best technology power vr is
the best GPU because you run this
application 30 times and every time you
get the exact same result yeah well i
hope you uh you know continue doing the
good work you do you know and i really
wanted to say big thank you for your
time being able to pick your brain no
problem all right we'll look forward to
speaking with you again yeah it's a dark
slack away with android authority and
imagination technologies reporting live
