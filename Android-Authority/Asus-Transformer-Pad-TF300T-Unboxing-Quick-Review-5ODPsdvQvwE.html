Youngberg once again representing the
best website for all things Android
related Android authority comm today
we've got an unboxing and quick review
of the Asus Transformer Pad now this is
the TF 300 T as you can see right here
this is the blue model and we've got a
few specs here but we'll go ahead and go
over those specs once we don't box it
now we also got the Asus Transformer Pad
mobile dock that we're gonna be unboxing
in the same video so just a little treat
for you guys anyways we'll open up the
contents of the box right now slide the
top off basically that's all it's on the
box we have a few graphics right here
HDMI powered by the NVIDIA Tegra all
that stuff now the box itself is
actually quite nice we have some nice
padding right here so you know that it
shipped correctly and didn't get busted
up in transit so anyways here's the
actual device we have some specs right
here and take it out of the box we have
some more compartments there but we'll
just check out the device for now
anyways we have a nice coating on here
to prevent it from any scratches during
shipping
does say we have our Tegra 3 quad-core
processor we have our specs right here
for the size it's nine point nine nine
point nine excuse me millimeters slim
and then it's 635 grams
light we have our wide view angle IPS
panel now this is an IPS LCD display we
have our eight megapixel rear-facing
camera with autofocus we have some sonic
master crystal pure sound reproduction
and then we do have our keyboard dock
info right there let's go peel the
plastic off the back this is a really
really nice device has some weight but
that just lets you know it's built with
extreme quality we have our speaker
right here that are 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack right there atop the
device down here we have our connector
don't know what pin that is we do have
our keyboard dock slots there on this
side we've got our mini HDMI as well as
our SD card slot and then on top we have
our power button here's our 8 megapixel
rear facing camera and then our specs
for the front facing camera is
point two megapixels okay so anyways
let's just check out what to the rest of
the box right now we can lift up this
compartment and we have our information
within this little panel got our iPad
excellent easy and exciting inspiring
innovation persistent perfection this is
a warranty card just like our user
manual here all that stuff's gonna be
pretty basic use our transformer pad
cleaning cloth that's a nice thing to
include in the box open her up really
quick it's a quality cleaning cloth very
cool and then we have our charger and
our AC adapter and see if there's
anything under there is nothing else in
there did not come with headphones but
that's not a huge deal I'm sure everyone
has a spare set of headphones laying
around especially all you Android lovers
let's go ahead and pop this stuff back
into the box and we'll get on with
plugging the device in and powering it
up for the first time for a quick look
at the software it looks like going to
lean a little bit more battery charge to
power up so we'll let that charge as we
unbox our transformer pad mobile dock
slip the top off of this once again the
nice rubber here prevents any shipping
mishaps and we have our black plastic
coating on there now before we take the
plastic coating off let's see what's in
this compartment looks like what is
happening looks like we just have our
user information and whatnot in there so
let's take the plastic off of our keypad
this is a really well-built dock as you
can see we have our raised keys in there
much like a higher quality computer
keyboard feels really well easy to use
we have our mouse almost right here we
can surf and scroll just like that we
can tilt this up for a different viewing
angle and we can lock the device with
this slider so go ahead and pop our
advice in there and our full review go
over the features of the keyboard dock
and all that so let's just see if our
device is powered on by now alright so
we got our Asus Eee Pad booted up let's
just check out the user interface as you
can see we have custom soft keys but
these are themed over the Ice Cream
Sandwich operating system we've got a
custom dock bar here but we'll go into
our settings we have our Asus asu's
customize settings we can go into our
about tablet to see we're running
android 4.0.3 with the easter-egg now
anyways we'll go back you can check out
the user interface it's really nice we
have custom little sliders up here nice
screen transitions we'll go ahead and go
into our apps here we have Tegra zone
games this has really good gaming
support I actually received a controller
and the speaker system from Nvidia that
will be doing a full review with the
tablet very very shortly so stay tuned
for that
anyways it's just the basic user
interface we'll be doing a full review
for the tablet as well so I want you
guys to check back and maybe see that
and anyways stay tuned with Android
authority comm and the meanwhile guys
