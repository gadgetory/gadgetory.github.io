Authority if we just waited for everyone
else's rumors to come out so here we go
LG has yet to officially announce the LG
v 30 but feasible speculation from
various sources suggests that it is on
its way and possibly in the next two
months
the LG v 30 is tipped to be unveiled on
August 31st one day before the opening
of FIFA 2017 this rumors first picked up
by the investor and then backed up again
by a separate source and at first glance
it seems unlikely
LG's previous v-series phone didn't
launch at Aoife or indeed see any
official release in Europe at all
however if LG was to launch the V 30 in
Europe as has been suggested this would
be the best time in place to do it ahead
of the Mobile World Congress next
February and the company might be keen
to get its new phone out there to take
the shine off the upcoming 10th
anniversary of the iPhone expected in
September if we do see the V 30 at Aoife
its official release will probably
follow a few weeks later in South Korea
for sure but hopefully globally now
let's talk about price tag and no big
surprises here it's still early days to
be putting down a definite price to the
LG v 30 although ET News has offered one
suggestion they believe that the LG v 30
could set you back 800,000 Korean Won
the equivalent of around six hundred $99
u.s. for the version touting 64
gigabytes of internal space 32 128
gigabyte models are also anticipated you
want to keep in mind that its
predecessor the LG v 20 was priced at
approximately $7.99 I know what you're
thinkin Jase just get to the specs well
the device is expected to sport a
snapdragon 835 processor a 3200 milliamp
hour battery
ip68 certification for dust and water
resistant and is expected to sport a
headphone jack
both the LG b 10 and the LG b 20 were
known for offering high-quality audio so
the chances are that this will be a
standout feature once again more
recently however leaker on leaks has
suggested that the unit would come with
wireless charging a dual rear camera
setup and a rear fingerprint scanner the
latter two of which are also supported
by the image you see right here on leaks
also speculates that the V 30 will have
a glass rear something
would corroborate the talk of the ip68
rating this would - the hope of a
removable battery though the v10 Envy 20
both featured removable batteries but
the design was far from waterproof as
for the display LG is said to be
utilizing an OLED panel instead of the
LCD screens typically used on a 10 set
this may be to support a curved display
like on its LG G flex devices which also
uses an OLED technology but it also may
just be a flat panel this would probably
be a bezel if display more like the LG G
six than the LG B 20 and it is equally
likely to include a second screen built
into it as the v10 NV 20 did this may
feature an insect camera similar to
what's seen on the essential phone now
for this LG patent you see here it has
spread some speculation that there may
be a slider concept design for the V 30
we're pretty confident these were very
early ideas though and won't make it
into the final product so what do you
guys think has this got you a little bit
excited would you hold off on the s8 or
the note 8 in order for this puppy let
me know in the comments below meet
