our smartphone future where our devices
don't necessarily have screens so much
as they are the screens and with their
concept found they've gotten about 91%
of the way there
however there are definitely some things
we have to keep in mind with this new
take on a smartphone it's charge of a
card from Android authority what's going
on everybody
and this is the Xiaomi me mix I first a
quick disclaimer regarding this phone
you are going to be dealing with a phone
made in only small quantities and it's
only going to be sold in China because
of that a lot of you viewers out there
may not even ever get to own this device
because of that we're not really taking
this review as a look at this phone as a
daily driver so much as we're taking a
look at mainly the features that it
introduces and a couple of the things
that the Xiaomi mix brings to the market
this phone is made entirely of ceramic
and it makes for a very flashy looking
device we do love the look of the Xiaomi
me mix however there are a few big
problems with it big is kind of the
right way to put it because this is a
very large phone six point four inches
is what you get for the size of the
screen and then the entire device just
slips about so easily because ceramic is
a slippery material not to mention the
fact that it is very fingerprint prone
there is a case that comes with the
phone made of a high quality premium
feeling leather but unfortunately that
leather covers up what is otherwise a
very wonderful looking phone all of the
different tropes you would expect around
the sides
come here including the buttons on the
side and the camera and fingerprint
reader here on the back but on the front
once you turn on the display you realize
that things have actually changed in
order to make room for this massive
display that bleeds over to the very
edges of the phone they had to move the
front facing camera the phone speaker
and the proximity sensor the
front-facing camera is found now at the
bottom and the other two features are
things we're going to dive into in the
hardware section overall this might be
one of the sexiest phones that we've
seen this year but mainly because of its
ceramic but also because of the screen
up front so let's go ahead and talk
about that this IPS display comes in at
2040 by 1080 resolution that's right
this is a 1080p display and that is a
little bit of a bummer not necessarily
because Full HD is really all that bad
but because quad HD seems to make a
little bit more sense for a phone screen
this size but even then there's plenty
of real estate to enjoy everything from
text to videos to games and we
definitely played quite a few games on
here including the game don't starve
which performs beautifully thanks to the
Snapdragon 820 1 and the 4 gigabytes of
RAM that backs it up for an IPS display
it does get plenty bright even in broad
daylight and the saturation has been
bumped up a little bit to make
everything look that a little bit more
vibrant but there's another thing that
you have to keep in mind that's 17 by 9
aspect ratio you might be seeing me
right now on the Xiaomi me mix and you
see that there are black bars on the
sides of me that's because with 17 by 9
aspect ratio there's a little bit of
extra room for all of the different
content and there's a lot of it pretty
much all of it out there that is made in
16 by 9 aspect
ratio that means that there's a little
bit of extra space and this'll
letterboxing that occurs makes the phone
feel like it has more bezel than it
really has and ultimately it takes away
from the immersion that the display is
supposed to provide after all the phone
is supposed to be all display all the
time there are some trade-offs in order
to make a screen like this and Xiaomi is
hoping that with this concept phone it's
going to become a feature you might see
in future phones as we mentioned already
the Snapdragon 820 one performs
beautifully on here and with the me UI
we didn't really have any problems when
it came to speed and snappiness of the
user interface and any applications that
we installed on here in the base for
gigabyte ram model you get 128 gigabytes
of on-board storage and then the 6
gigabyte ram version has 256 gigabytes
of on-board storage that's just
absolutely ridiculous and it's great
that that is the case because there is
no micro SD card slot with all of that
storage freedom I was able to put so
much video content and also games onto
here and I enjoyed all of it
so with that kind of onboard storage it
really makes this screen that much more
enjoyable and that much more useful and
of course you have the USB C port on the
bottom that does qc3 in order to charge
the 4400 million power battery but I
actually found myself not needing to
charge this one all that often because
on any given day I could get over five
to six hours of screen on time and in
one case I got seven hours given my
usage even for a screen this large
having it at 1080 resolution is probably
a good choice in terms of battery life
but even then I'm not really able to use
this phone on LTE carriers here in the
States
because since it's a Chinese phone it
would only connect to HSPA+ which
finally brings us to the two main
features that had to be changed in order
to make the screen happen the proximity
sensor actually has a very elegant
alternative and that is a sonar sensor I
honestly didn't find any differences in
the daily usage of this particular
device because of that so that means it
should be working pretty well otherwise
the phone speaker is probably the one
thing that really hurts this device
because the vibrating piece of ceramic
underneath the surface that vibrates and
emits sound that way unfortunately it's
just not a good alternative it doesn't
get loud enough at all even at the
highest volumes for calls and I found
myself digging the phone into my ear
because I thought I had it in
bad position I would have to put in a
pair of headphones with a microphone on
them or use a Bluetooth headset just to
be able to enjoy my calls and that
simply is just not a good mark for the
Xiaomi me mix the last portion of the
phone that had to be changed was the
camera and is brought down to the bottom
right for the front-facing shooter and
there are a couple of issues with that
but at least they can be changed by
turning the phone upside down after all
we are taking a look at me right now on
the front-facing camera and the upward
angle because of his positioning is not
all that ideal so selfies might be a
little bit tougher to get in the first
place but also if I was to bring my
thumb down to the shutter button you can
see that my thumb actually appears on
the top right of this frame so that's
also not very ideal and it does show up
when you're doing landscape selfies as
well then again you could turn the phone
upside down like I just mentioned even
then selfies at 5 megapixels are only
decent at best beauty mode is pretty
aggressive and is on by default and the
photos lack a certain sharpness and
crispness that we would otherwise want
really the best part about using this
camera is the fact that the entire
screen can become the viewfinder which
is in and of itself pretty awesome and
when you're recording video you can see
quite literally everything that's going
on in the frame because the screen is so
large and then the rear shooter honestly
is kind of good on paper but not
necessarily an overachiever 16 megapixel
shooters at F 2.0 aperture sound good
but the processing that Johnny puts into
their camera app is unfortunately the
Achilles heel in a lot of different
photos when taken with HDR on auto
there's just a lack of sharpness because
the noise reduction makes everything
look really smudgy and then as the light
goes away and you get into darker
situations this only gets worse colours
are also kind of inconsistent in certain
photos the colors look wonderful and
have a little bit of saturation but
turning on HDR can help those photos
that don't have enough saturation though
that does happen more often than we
would like especially right now there
are a bunch of wonderful cameras out
there and there's almost no excuse for
having a subpar or even just decent
camera these days for a flagship when
you compare it to the low-light
performance of let's say a Google pick
so you can already see all of those
issues and finally we can get to the
software and that is the me UI the me UI
is in this phone the Chinese version
that was translated to English with
Google Play services kind of tacked
so the software experience is not
indicative of the entire me UI
experience nor is it indicative of this
phone because it's not going to be
coming to the u.s. at all but that said
we can see why the me UI is one of the
most popular Chinese operating systems
even if for us we don't really like the
lack of an app drawer it still is one of
the speediest s-- and smoothest
experiences and it's also one of the
most polished out of all of the asian
operating systems so for this entire
package if you happen to live in China
and you're watching this video well you
can get your hands on it for a price
that roughly translates to about 500 to
600 dollars the u.s. depending on what
version you get but for everybody else
those importing cost could be pretty
killer so this phone will end up being
more expensive and so there you have it
the Xiaomi me mix a look at a phone that
is trying to introduce some new features
that hopefully will come in future
smartphones the main thing to really
take away from this is that a screen
that is virtually bezel this is
something we all want and it is very fun
to use on this device despite the
caveats that it has as a device on its
own it's simply a little bit too big and
that phone speaker being a vibrating
piece of ceramic that doesn't get loud
enough is one of the biggest bummers and
then just below that is a subpar camera
experience but there's a lot to love
about this phone including the onboard
storage the very good performance and
all in all the wonderful and sleek look
and I can't help but think that Xiaomi
made this phone this big because even
they think that this screen could work
pretty well on something like a 7-inch
tablet after all you don't really need
to have a front-facing camera and the
proximity sensor and phone speaker
aren't really part of pretty much any
tablet anyway so you could make a 7-inch
tablet for example that is literally the
slab that Xiaomi is trying to give us a
look at so maybe that's something to
think about in the future but for
smartphones the Xiaomi me mix like I
said at best is a glimpse into our
future but at its worst it's an example
as to why that future is still a little
ways off as always thank you guys very
much for watching and I hope you enjoyed
this review of the Xiaomi me mix it's
actually a pretty wonderful device but
it has some main issues whether that
kind of harken back to the problems that
any smartphone has especially in the
Chinese market but even then a glimpse
into the future shows us what pitfalls
we currently have that might keep us
from getting there at least for now stay
tuned to Android
authority for all of the best including
more from Xiaomi and across the world of
Android and you can head over to other
websites to dive outside the world of
Android including tab time sound guys
charge to IO and VR source and then when
you're done with all of that pop on over
to Android or neucom because we are your
