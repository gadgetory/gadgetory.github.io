authority and as you guys may already
know we go through a lot of phones here
so when it comes to the question of what
is our daily driver we technically don't
really have one at least not in the
traditional sense where we may use a
phone for a year two years or even
longer and because we're constantly
switching phones
my definition of a daily driver is a
little bit different what I consider a
daily driver is a phone that I always
end up defaulting back to or going back
to once I'm done reviewing another phone
or if I'm not reviewing a phone at all
this will be the phone that I use and
the phone that I'm going to be using as
my daily driver at least for the
foreseeable future is going to be the
Galaxy s8 more specifically the s8 plus
and here are five reasons why to that
intro so reason number one is the
display and this wouldn't be an s8 video
if we didn't talk about that screen I
know you guys have probably heard it a
hundred times over by now but it really
is an incredible looking display Samsung
just knows how to make good screens and
it is hands-down the best display on a
smartphone right now the colors are
amazing it's extremely bright vibrant
and full of contrast and I love the way
the glass spills over on the sides
Samsung's definitely come a long way
since the experiment that was the Note
edge and on the s8 s8 plus it's
something you have to see in person to
truly appreciate personally I prefer the
larger screen of the f8 plus because I
think it's more immersive for games and
videos I know some people may feel
differently because the extra screen
real estate makes the phone way too big
but honestly it's not that much
different in size from other phones like
the pixel XL the iPhone 7 plus or the
LGV 20 in some ways it's actually
smaller especially in terms of its width
and on top of that it has a larger
screen than all those phones so I think
the larger screen is totally worth it
even if it does make the phone slightly
wider and taller the design of the phone
is what allows
screen to stand out and that leads me to
reason number two the design complements
the screen extremely well the curves
look and feel very sleek and it's a
perfectly symmetrical design all the way
around what I really love about this
phone though is the way it looks from
the front the super thin bezels are
amazing of course but I was a huge fan
of Nexus devices and the front reminds
me a lot of what Nexus phone would look
like
there's no logos no buttons or branding
to muck up the front it's just a super
clean look and although it most likely
won't happen I wouldn't be mad if Google
used this design for the next pixel
reason number three is the software and
I never thought I'd say this but I
actually really like the software on the
Galaxy S a four year Samsung software
has felt like a cluttered mess on top of
Android but ever since the Galaxy s6
Samsung has made a ton of improvements
and it finally feels like the software
actually matches the great hardware that
Samsung has been putting out the new
Samsung experience actually feels like
it meshes and compliments Andrew and
really well whereas older versions felt
like an unnecessary layer of fat that
was clunky overwhelming and made Android
really cumbersome to use I loved the new
clean and minimalistic approach that
Samsung is going for here the new icons
are refreshing to look at and everything
is mostly black and white with just a
splash of color in areas like the
notification shade and settings menu
it's a stark contrast from old versions
of TouchWiz that were heavily coated in
nasty greens and blues there's a lot of
attention to detail here and it's the
little things that make the biggest
difference like the swipe up gesture to
open the app drawer that makes it feel
more like a pixel or the ability to
change the order of the navigation
buttons which is great because Samsung's
implementation always felt completely
backwards when they were using hardware
keys Samsung's software does still come
with quite a bit of features but some of
them are useful and none of them ever
feel invasive and if you don't want them
you can simply just turn it off what I
enjoy the most is the amount of
customization that's built into the
software now the theme engine is still
just as awesome as ever and allows you
to tweak pretty much everything from the
icons wallpapers and the color scheme of
the general interface the always-on
display is more robust than ever now and
even this can be customized with a ton
of high quality beams or
image from your gallery reason number
four why bs8 plus is my daily driver are
the extra hardware features and Samsung
always does a really great job of
including extra Hardware on their phones
like
ip68 dust and water resistance wireless
charging and expandable storage and
while I may not use these features every
single day I do appreciate them and
would rather have them there than not
have them at all and I think that
everyone that buys this phone will find
them either useful right away or
somewhere down the line during their
time of owning one usually bluetooth is
not worth mentioning but it is here for
the Galaxy s8 because it's one of the
first devices to ship with Bluetooth 5
which brings a host of new improvements
like 2 times the speed four times the
range and the ability to link up to
Bluetooth devices at once last but not
least my fifth reason for choosing the
s8 plus as my daily driver is the camera
Samsung isn't doing anything fancy with
their camera but can always rely on
Samsung's cameras to deliver a good
picture in almost every situation the
dual pixel autofocus is still easily one
of my favorite features about this
camera simply because of how fast and
accurately you can focus on a subject
and a faster autofocus means you'll snap
photos much quicker and take a lot more
of them
speaking of autofocus the front-facing
camera also now features autofocus and
while I don't think the front camera is
amazing in terms of quality it is a nice
feature to have and I like these
snapchat s features that are built-in
which makes the front camera a lot of
fun to use and that permission rounds
out my five reasons why the f8 plus is
my daily driver the screen is gorgeous
the build is amazing and I certainly
don't mind the bigger size in favor of
the extra screen real estate it also
checks all the right boxes in terms of
performance specs and overall features
and certainly lives up to the hype and
the hefty price tag
it's not a perfect smartphone no
smartphone is but you just have to find
the right smartphone that fulfills the
majority of your wants and needs and for
me the s8 plus does exactly that but let
