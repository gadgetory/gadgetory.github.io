hindi the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Google Play weekly this
week we're gonna be talking about goat
simulator Dragon Quest and a security
flaw in the Android browser along with a
bunch of other cool stuff so let's get
started first up this week is an
application that lets you browse the web
without internet the app is called
cosmos and here's how it works when you
surf the web the browser uses a unique
back-end system to send the web pages to
you through SMS rather than through data
it's quite a bit slower than regular web
browsers and you'll only ever get the
website text but this will be a great
application for those who replaces
without reliable web connections it's
due out sometime later this month and
their security vulnerability found in
the Android browser may affect up to 40%
of Android users I make it sound worse
than it really is the security flaw is
found in the old a OSP stock Android
browser it allows certain JavaScript
code to get past the browser security
and cause some issues the fix is really
easy because all you need to do is
change to a different web browser and
you're totally safe again for those
keeping score google recommended google
chrome if Google Play services begin
rolling out their version 6.1 update
this last week and it's pretty awesome
most of the stuff is focused at
developers so we probably won't see much
of it at the consumer side of things for
a long time the improvements in this
update were for Google Drive analytics
and the newly released Google fits like
I said most of this stuff is for
developers but you'll still want to
install the update when it eventually
rolls out to you in a blog post that was
posted earlier this week Google has
officially asked developers to be more
Android one friendly for those who may
not know Android 1 is the initiative to
get cheap Android phones into the hands
of the other 5 billion people who don't
already have it
Google's calder developers ask them to
keep in mind problems with a typical
Android 1 usual face such as shoddy
internet connections and to make their
applications work better with those kind
of conditions it'll be interesting to
see how that turns out last and
certainly not least this week there were
four Android applications that were
released on Prem OS that's right friends
duolingo Evernote vine and sight words
have been released to the Chrome OS
Store and you can go get them right now
these are Android applications that
currently run on Chrome OS as part of
the app runtime on Chrome which is an
initiative to create a more seamless
experience between chrome and Android
keep an eye out because more of these
apps are going to be popping up soon
so who wants to see some trending
applications as usual if you want to
check any of these applications out you
can find the links in the written
companion which is in the video
description below
goat simulator is an impossibly
hilarious and goofy game we control a
goat and go do absurd goat things this
was a hotly anticipated title on PC and
equally anticipated on mobile you can
pick it up right now for $4.99 in the
Google Play Store and there are no
in-app purchases it's time to go get
your goat on Square Enix fans rejoice
because the original Dragon Quest has
been re-released for Android it's
received a little bit of a graphics bump
and some mobile optimized controls but
otherwise it's the same Dragon Quest you
remember playing as a kid it's going for
$2.99
in the Google Play Store which is cheap
for a Square Enix game and not a bad
price to pay for some nostalgia if
you're not a fan of old-school JRPGs
then make sure you steer clear of this
one
like many OEMs modo put a lot of their
OEM specific features into regular
applications and then release them to
the Google Play Store so they could get
faster updates moto voice formerly known
as touchless control is the latest OAM
app to make it to the Google Play Store
if you have a moto phone then you should
have this application installed and if
you don't have a moto phone you can't
have this application installed and that
kind of sucks a little bit sub is a
newly released application that lets you
see what your friends see for about 10
seconds here's how it works your screen
will show what their phone camera can
see you then swipe in various directions
and the application will tell the person
to pan in those directions so you can
see better we have no clue why this
application exists but it seems pretty
cool just beware it's having some launch
date issues and we hope they get worked
out soon
last up this week is lean droid this is
a minimal style application that will
help you take control of your battery
life the interface is a little wordy but
not difficult to understand and people
have saved countless hours of battery
life just a little bit of tinkering it's
free with in-app purchases and was
recently updated with a lot of bug fixes
and performance improvements and it also
brought back the dark theme if you want
to see the latest and greatest in
