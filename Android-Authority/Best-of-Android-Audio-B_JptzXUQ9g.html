handy from and Rhoda 30.com you know
smart phones have replaced pretty much
everything when it comes to listening to
music these days and if you want to know
which smart phones are the best ones for
music well that's a question where I try
to answer right now okay folks so we
tested a grand total of seven smart
phones and they are the BlackBerry
privity galaxy note 5 the LG v10 the
Motorola Droid turbo 2 the Nexus 6p the
Xperia z5 premium and last but certainly
not least the ZTE axon which we included
thanks to its 24-bit high-five deck
which made it a prime candidate for this
test to give us an overview of how each
smartphone performs we put each
headphone jack through a focus right to
i2 interface and then ran the popular
write mark audio analyzer checking for
frequency response noise and distortion
characteristics will start with noise
and crosstalk which should push well
through the negative 96 decibel floor
offered by the 16-bit audio if any of
our high quality Doc's want to come
close to realizing their touted 24 or
32-bit performance
crosstalk isolation is excellent across
all of the models but none of our
smartphones made a notable move past
negative 96 decibels the Xperia z5
premium plucks in at a decent negative
100 decibels while these été acts on
falls way short at just negative 92
decibels it's by no means noisy but it
seems to defeat the objective of
offering a 24-bit DAC and LG's 32 bit
DAC boasting is just outright ridiculous
now to be fair to the smart phones when
approaching negative 100 decibels we are
starting to push up against the noise
limits of our testing equipment
so to avoid complicating the results
we'll simply test with 16-bit audio from
here on out next up is dynamic range
which is the difference between the
loudest and the quietest outputs we
should see all of our smartphones hit
the full 96 decibel dynamic range
afforded by our 16-bit signal tests
while some smartphones do three of our
models fall short the Nexus 6p the
Xperia z5 premium and the ZTE axon
cannot reach the target meaning
according to our resident audiophile rob
Triggs the circuit noise is likely
making its way to the signal path this
isn't an unexpected result from a
compact device with lots of potential
for interference but the circuit layout
and the leading phones appears to be
better thought out
the total harmonic distortion results
are excellent across the board with all
of the handsets putting in performance
well below 0.004% which is really good
by the way the ZTE axon is the winner by
a small margin followed by the Prive and
then the v10 the real test for music
though is intermodulation distortion
because this shows the amount of
distortion generated when playing back
multiple tones there is a far greater
disparity in this test with the LG v10
Nexus 6p and the ZTE axon all taking the
lead coming in at or below 0.01% the
galaxy note 5 in the Xperia z5 premium
are very close at about 0.01 2 percent
while the Prive and the droid turbo 2
are the worst performers it should be
noted that such small percentage
differences are going to be very tough
if not impossible to tell apart so
pretty much all of these phones are
right about Tide frequency response is
as flat as you can get across all tested
smartphones at least when connected up
to our interface interestingly the Droid
turbo - the Nexus 6p the BlackBerry
Prive and the LG v10 seem to have a
low-pass filter on their DAC output with
a negative 3 decibel point at just over
18 kilohertz this is likely designed to
remove any high-frequency interference
from high-speed signals such as the
codec clock without interfering with the
audible spectrum or it could be
something in the software it is a bit
disappointing to see that none of the
higher resolution devices offer a
noticeable bit depth advantage but this
just highlights the difficulties and
fitting low noise audio circuits into a
mobile phone if nothing else with that
said the 32 bit LG v10 performs
consistently well across all of the
tests followed closely by the galaxy
note 5 and the hi-fi ZTE axon of course
no audio test would be complete without
a good old fashioned listening test
Robert Triggs who did most of the work
on the research for this video performed
the audio test as well he used a pair of
AKG K 5 50s along with some flak encoded
music files to summarize his findings he
found that the LG v tend to be the best
in the listening test with the note 5 in
the Xperia z5 having favorable
experiences the droid turbo 2 and the
Nexus 6p were among the worst performers
with the Prive and the axon falling
somewhere in the middle if you want to
check out all of Rob's findings for this
test which I do encourage that you do
you can find his entire experience in
the written companion which is linked in
the video description below the last
test we performed was the rear speaker
volume most people use this for game
videos are music when headphones and
Bluetooth speakers aren't readily
available now it is important to
remember the decibels are a logarithmic
scale and for every 10 decibel increased
results in roughly doubling of the
perceived loudness of the sound this
makes the LG v10 the loudest of the
bunch by some margin offering up double
the peak volume of the BlackBerry Prive
the Xperia z5 premium and the ZTE axon
at a whopping 100 decibels we honestly
don't recommend sticking your ear right
next to the speaker on that phone given
the decent performance of the ZTE axon
in the headphones test the speakers were
kind of a major disappointment we didn't
have any complaints about the other
phones but the axon speaker was
horrendously tinny when you take the
whole picture into account the LG v10 is
the clear winner it comes out as the
best performer in both the jack and
speaker tests and it just sounds really
good second place in a very close run
contest was the samsung galaxy note 5
with the xperia z5 premium and the Nexus
6p all putting in good performances the
Galaxy Note 5 just edges out ahead in
the benchmark and speaker tests which
puts it in second place and the
excellent sound on the z5 premium earned
at a third place entry
sadly the acts on phones disappointing
dynamic range and speaker results hurt
what was otherwise a lovely sounding
phone but we have to assess phones on
their full package and not just part of
it unfortunately the Moto droid turbo 2
didn't stand out in the listening test
and have the worst distortion results so
it earned itself a spot on the bottom if
you want to see all these charts again
don't forget to check out the written
version and the video description below
and feel more than welcome to converse
about our findings in the comments below
once again i'm joe handy from android
authority comm while you're here you
might as well subscribe to the android
authority youtube channel if you're
hanging out for a minute we have a
couple of awesome videos for you to
watch right over there and they're also
linked in the video description below
for you folks on mobile finally don't
forget to check out the written
companion which is in the video
description below and keep an eye out
because we have a whole bunch more of
these best of android videos as always
thanks for watching everybody and have a
wonderful day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
