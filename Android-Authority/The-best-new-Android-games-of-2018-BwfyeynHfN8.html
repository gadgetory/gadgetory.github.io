hindi from android authority comm
earlier we did the best new android apps
from 2018 and of course that means we
have to do the best new android games of
2018 so let's get started okay so we
basically did this the same way as we
did with the app video we ran a poll
used your feedback to help us make our
decisions and we came up with the list
we're only going to cover our five
favorites in this video but we do have a
full list of 15 along with a whole bunch
of honorary mentions in the article
version which is linked up in the video
description below if you don't see your
favorite 2018 game here check their to
HQ trivia was the very first Android
game launched in 2018 with its first
quiz round played just moments after
midnight on New Year's it brings with it
one of the most unique mobile quiz game
experiences ever and aside from the
occasional Network issue it's actually a
pretty fun game here's what the game is
like once a day and twice a day on
weekdays players gather in the game to
compete in a live game show complete
with a live host each player that shows
up gets the same 12 questions and the
players left standing at the end all
split the four real cash prize the host
is usually Scott Rogowski although other
hosts have graced the game's big stage
as well it's quick it's simple and it's
surprisingly intense feels like a real
game show games take place at 3 p.m.
Eastern Standard Time on weekdays and 9
p.m. Eastern Standard Time every day the
limited number of plays per day helps
keep the game from feeling too
repetitive because you can't binge play
it there are some concerns about the
networking issues and there are some
people who like to cheat the system
because they suck however for the most
part it's something we've never seen
before and that's difficult to do on a
Google Play Store with millions and
millions of apps and games part-time UFO
is the first release of how laboratories
the developers of the popular Kirby
series as well as the first Super Smash
Bros game so you know what you're kind
of getting here a family-friendly game
with easy mechanics no in-app purchases
and no advertising part-time UFO
delivers all of that in spades the game
starts with an alien crash landing on
earth and your job is to help it
complete jobs with its little spaceship
and its little hook I'm not gonna lie to
you
this game is adorable the soundtrack is
perfect for this kind of thing and the
mechanics really are easy even if the
levels themselves get more and more
Foucault there are also little
customizations that you can buy with the
money that you earn and several medals
per level for completing the tasks in a
specific way virtually nobody who has
played this game dislikes it at rocks a
4.9 rating on the Google Play Store
it's a rock-solid experience with no
crashes or issues that we could find and
it's just a fun little arcade puzzle
game maybe the three metal system is a
little overplayed and maybe the game
could have had some variety of mechanics
but maybe I don't care about that stuff
because I was busy having fun in any
case this is a great mobile game the
room old sins is an easy choice for a
video like this it's the fourth game and
a critically acclaimed indie puzzle
franchise it rocks virtually a perfect
rating on Google Play and there honestly
isn't anything wrong with it it's a
continuation of one of the best and one
of the first truly great premium mobile
gaming experiences those who have played
the room before know what's happening
you solve a series of intricate puzzles
each one leading to even more intricate
puzzles the previous three games took
place in a series of regular sized rooms
old sins still takes place in a series
of rooms but these rooms are in a
dollhouse you play as an investigator
trying to find the null element and
players make their way through the
dollhouse to break the seal and obtain
said elements what else can I say here
the graphics are outstanding the
mechanics are enjoyable smooth and
engaging and fireproof games has gotten
a lot better at creating narratives it
adds some nuance that prior games didn't
have while still keeping the feeling of
mystery alive and well just like its
predecessors there isn't a lot of extra
analysis necessary really it's simply
fantastic pocket city is a city building
simulator similar to Sim City uh-huh
try saying that one three times fast
anyway it's launched with somewhat
innocuous it didn't get a lot of fanfare
that many other new mobile games got
this year but we think it deserves
better than that because this is easily
one of the most competently put together
simulators that we saw all year the game
plays like you would expect a city
building Sim to play and for a 2018
mobile game that's actually one of its
best features you build a city manager
utilities and make sure that your city
draws a profits the game offers some
fairly in-depth stats like citizen
happiness environmental impact and even
the supply and demand of your goods
based on how you set your city's taxes
yes for real it plays as fast or as slow
as
player once and players have a ton of
control along with plenty of unlockable
content Pocket City likely won't make a
ton of best lists this year because the
launch came and went so quickly however
don't count this one out it's easily one
of the best city building Sims currently
on any platform and after the
disappointment of the freemium Laden
launch of SimCity build-it
it's nice to see a premium game swooped
in and fill that void with a very strong
experience our Pick of the game of the
year goes to both fortnight and pub G
okay here's the thing folks I personally
think that fortnight is the stronger
game when compared to pub G Mobile
however our fan poll clearly lists pub G
as the fan favorite so I'm going to
compromise with our readers and kind of
put them both here these games provided
a very similar experience for players
they are both battle royale shooters
that made a monumental splash in 2018
they both feature 100 person battles
where the winner is the last person
standing player scratch around for
weapons and resources do battle with one
another and choose their starting
locations by dropping from a flying
vehicle they are more similar than they
are different fortnight offers a more
animated experience players can craft
things the flying vehicle as a school
bus and there is simply more stuff to do
additionally your account actually syncs
with the console and PC version so your
unlockables are available cross-platform
and I personally think that gives it a
leg up over pub G mobile however
fortnight is in beta for most devices
and you have to download it directly
from the Epic Games website instead of
from Google Play I totally get how that
can make the experience less enjoyable
at first pub G Mobile on the other hand
is available in the Play Store right now
along with a lite version for less
powerful devices it scales the battle
down to 50 people instead of 100 pub G
mobile plays a little more seriously
with a bit more of a survival game edge
and it's not in beta which means it's
more stable and currently available on
more devices on the other hand it
doesn't offer cross device syncing and I
think that is a glaring flaw fortnight
fans are obviously going to play
fortnight and pub G fans are obviously
going to play pub G mobile and I'm not
here to argue with those people both of
these games offer categorically similar
experiences so the better one is a
matter of preference both of these games
made battle royale shooters the talk of
2018 and they both deserve equal credit
for it however if you put a gun to my
head and mate
me choose I'm going with fortnight
because that cross-platform support is
super crucial for cross-platform games
like these and that about does it for
this one folks if you like this video
you know exactly what to do and if not
you still know exactly what to do the
full 15 game article is linked up in the
video description below as our links for
all of the games mentioned in this video
as always thanks for watching everybody
and have a wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
