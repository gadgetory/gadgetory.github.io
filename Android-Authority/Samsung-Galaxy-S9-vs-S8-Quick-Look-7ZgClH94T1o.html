on everybody and here we're taking a
look at the Galaxy S 9 versus the galaxy
s 8 now one quick perspective here the
Galaxy S seven is still used by a lot of
users out there and they're quite happy
with it so what we're looking at here is
basically the top two in a very high
powered line of smartphones much of the
outside might seem the same but
improvements have been made that make
the s 9 a worthy step away from the S 8
colors now have a new edition in the
lilac purple edition which is a purple
hue that we actually surprisingly
enjoyed very much the size of the phones
are basically the same whether you go
for the plus sizes or for the smaller
regular editions and they are all backed
by ip68 certifications hardly anything
has really changed between these two but
those couple of pain points that people
had in the previous edition have been
addressed here the speaker grille on the
bottom is no longer a series of dots
which seems like a small detail but then
you realize that it is one of two
speakers there is a speaker on the front
integrated into the call speaker and now
you have a stereo setup really this
makes the sound experience much louder
and much fuller a very market
improvement over the original Galaxy s8
the other change is probably going to be
a welcome one for a lot of people out
there and it's the fingerprint reader on
the Galaxy Note 8 and on the galaxy s 8
it was a pain point that Samsung
addressed by putting the finger
parameter below the camera module so it
is lower on the body and easier to reach
with your index finger this is a great
move on their part even if it is clear
that Samsung is moving towards other
biometric meters like scanning your face
or scanning your iris both of those have
been put together into what is now
called the intelligent scan and this is
where things get really excited while
the F 1.7 aperture camera of these
Galaxy s8 was already a great performer
we now have one that is capable of F 1.5
and F 2.4 that's right you can change
the aperture and it is done mechanically
an actual iris will close and open to
the levels of F 1.5 and F 2.4 meaning
that depending on the situation you'll
get a lot more light and a lot more
depth of field Samsung still manages to
find ways of improving on the camera
experience whereas in the galaxy s 8 we
all pretty much agree that it was a
pretty great camera on its own already
and that also comes down to their better
image processing even the camera app is
a little bit different this time around
with all of the modes up top there are a
couple of modes that we did highlight in
a camera future focus video that include
the AR emoji which is basically like
bitmoji but you can actually cater it to
your liking and there's also the super
slo-mo that allows for 960 frames per
second video at 720p resolution but
there is an auto mode that figures out
when the motion is happening taking the
guesswork out of slow motion really the
camera is a lot of the story with the
galaxy s 9 as it does improve also
Bixby's assistance of course the Bigsby
button is on the side still and any
improvements that are made to Bigsby on
the galaxy s 9 will likely come in
software updates for the Galaxy S 8 as
well but the camera in Bixby in the s9
does provide things like live
translation and also food recognition
but aside from all of that excitement
much of the experience is still reliable
and very speedy you get the bump up in
performance you would expect with the
snapdragon 845 in the galaxy s 9 and the
galaxy s 9 plus brings an extra 2
gigabytes of ram renting it out to 6
gigabytes total which is definitely a
bit more of an upgrade compared to the
original si plus the screens are AMOLED
and come in the same sizes 5
point eight and 6.2 inches and one thing
we notice about the screen with the new
Galaxy S nines is that it doesn't seem
like the display is actually bleeding
all the way to the ends anymore and
finally in battery sizes Samsung kept
things about the same the Galaxy S nine
comes with the same 3000 milliamp hour
capacity while the Plus model comes with
3500 and so there you have it the
changes between the galaxy s 9 and the
previous generation there isn't a whole
lot differentiating these two phones and
if you have the galaxy s 8 you might
want to stick with it one good thing is
that if you do have a previous galaxy
device especially the galaxy s 8 then
you have the ability to trade in the old
phone for a deep discount on the new one
which can be pre-ordered on March 2nd
keep it tuned to Andrew authority for
more coverage on the galaxy s 9 and the
s 9 plus we have plenty to talk about
with this and don't forget to check out
the camera future focus feature so that
you can get a closer look at these
camera features that Samsung did add
into their newest device keep it tuned
here for more from Mobile World Congress
in Barcelona and to remember to stick
around because we are your source for
all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
