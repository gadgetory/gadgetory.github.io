Authority and it's been a while since
we've reviewed an Android tablet and
that's mostly due to the fact that
Android tablets have sort of been on the
decline and a lot of manufacturers
aren't really making them anymore but
one company by the name of Huawei is
still having some success with tablets
so let's take a look at their news
tablets this is the media pad m5 8.4
inch model and this is the media pad m5
Pro so just to be clear the media pad
m5s come in three different models you
have the 8.4 inch model and then you
have the 10.8 inch model which comes in
a pro and non pro version and the only
difference between the pro and non pro
is that the pro has a pen which wahby
calls the M Pen and it also comes with a
keyboard dock so you can turn the tablet
into a workstation if you want and
that's really the only difference
between the two 10.8 inch models now
what I really like about these tablets
is that no matter which model you get
the specs are exactly identical across
the board save for the screen size on
the 8.4 inch model obviously and the
slightly smaller battery but everything
else like the processor the RAM the
screen resolution the camera and the
software experience is pretty much all
the same as far as the design there's
really nothing too flashy about these
tablets they're pretty standard tablet
designs they're made completely out of
metal so they feel really high quality
and then you have some plastic antenna
lines across the top and bottom for
radio signals and improve cell reception
if you have the LTE editions of these
tablets you'll also notice that the
corners are rounded and the back is
slightly tapered so they feel really
comfortable in the hand the metal finish
is completely smooth to the touch so it
doesn't really give you a lot of grip
but it's a two-handed device anyway so
you're not really gonna have a whole lot
of problems with this falling out of
your hands unlike a lot of our
smartphones which have really really
thin bezels now the bezels on the front
of these tablets are really thick but I
don't really think that's a bad thing
because on the tablet you kind of want
to have those bezels so that when you're
playing games or watching a movie or
something you have an area to actually
rest your thumbs and be able to
comfortably hold the tablet without
blocking the screen
the screen itself has a resolution of
2560 by 1600 so they're plenty sharp and
it's an IPS panel so it's not quite as
contrast II you're not gonna get the
same inky deep blacks as an AMOLED
screen but I still found these screens
to be really really enjoyable the color
reproduction is really nice they have
great viewing angles and great contrast
and they also get pretty bright as well
that outdoor visibility isn't that big
of a deal so watching YouTube Netflix
movies playing games all that stuff has
been really really enjoyable on these
displays especially the 10.8 inch
version which gives you a lot more
screen real estate on the inside the
media pad m5s are being powered by the
ki-rin 960 processor and 4 gigabytes of
RAM and the 960 is actually Huawei's
last generation chipset but it's still a
really powerful processor I've had no
issues with performance on these tablets
they've been very smooth and very
responsive whether I'm multitasking
launching applications watching YouTube
videos or playing games everything has
ran perfectly fine and it's done a
fantastic job of keeping up with my
daily demands now as far as how these
tablets are going to perform months and
months down the road only time will tell
but as of right now they're doing a
great job the media pad m5 and m5 pro
are available in 32 64 and 128 gigabyte
models and there's also a micro SD card
slot if you want more storage on the
front there's also a fingerprint sensor
that's actually really really fast at
unlocking these tablets and you can also
use the fingerprint sensor as your way
of navigating the OS with swipe gestures
in place of the on-screen navigation
keys there's no headphone jack
unfortunately but Huawei does include an
adapter in the box so you can still use
your own headphones of choice but what I
really like about the audio experience
on these tablets is the speakers you
have dual speakers on the top and bottom
of the 8.4 inch model and you have quad
speakers on the 10.8 inch model which
are tuned by Harman Kardon and these
speakers I was a little bit skeptical
about the placement of them because on
the 8.4 inch model they're on the top
and bottom so you basically have side
firing audio and on the 10.8 inch model
they're basically rear-facing speakers
but these speakers sound incredible
they're extremely loud and not only do
they get very loud they're also really
crisp and clear there's a lot of low-end
punch to them as well
so if you would like to watch a lot of
YouTube a lot of Netflix or listen to
music these speakers are really amazing
for it and the multimedia experience is
that much better because of these
speakers battery life on these tablets
are equally as impressive you have a
7500 milliamp hour battery on the 10.8
inch model and a 50-100 milliamp hour
battery on the 8.4 inch and I've been
able to get a good day or two out of
these tablets but this is what's really
heavy usage I play a lot of games I
watched a lot of YouTube and I view
quite a few streams on Twitch as well
and I get around seven to eight hours of
screen on time on the 10.8 inch model
and around five to six on the eight
point four if you're a more casual user
you don't really use your tablets quite
as much I could imagine you'll probably
get at least a few days or maybe even
close to a week on these tablets but
with heavy use I've been really
impressed with the battery life and how
long they last let's talk a little bit
about what makes the m5 pro a pro tablet
one it comes with a stylus that Huawei
calls the M pen and two it has a
keyboard dock that basically turns it
into a laptop the pen itself is the size
of a regular pen so it's really
comfortable to hold and use and it also
has a really nice weight to it so it
doesn't feel cheap it charges with a USB
type-c port which is hidden underneath
the pen clip and wobbly says it'll last
up to 50 days on a single charge and I
haven't had it long enough to verify
that claim but I've only had to charge
at one time which is when I initially
took the pen out of the box the pen
pretty much does exactly what you might
expect the pen to do you can create
drawings or jot down notes you can also
do handwritten calculations with
Huawei's calculator app and there's also
two buttons on the side one button lets
you capture screen grabs and annotate
them and the other button basically who
serves as a left click so you don't have
to actually lift the pen off the screen
to tap or select an item the pen is also
magnetic so you can attach it to the
side of the tablet
the magnet is honestly pretty weak that
it will fall off with even the smallest
amount of force so I don't really
recommend using it the keyboard dock is
pretty nice it's a pretty spacious
keyboard given the size limitation the
keys have a nice amount of travel to
them they're very clicky and it's also
pretty easy to type on and I also like
that you have some physical shortcuts
for brightness Multimedia controls and
the Android navigation keys are on here
as well the trackpad isn't quite as nice
as the keyboard it's a little bit
cramped and things like scrolling or
dragging around items is very choppy and
laggy you're better off using the
touchscreen for things like that the
keyboard dock also doubles as a
protective case and the back actually
folds so that you can prop it up on your
desk or on your lap when you're typing
and it's made of a very soft touch
material which feels really nice but I'm
afraid it'll eventually stain over time
from things like your palm sweat or
whatever else you might get on this
keyboard tablet cameras historically
have been pretty bad and the media pad
m5s don't really do a whole lot to
change that you have an 8 megapixel
camera on the front and a 13 megapixel
camera on the rear which doesn't sound
all that bad on paper and these cameras
are perfectly serviceable and will get
the job done if you're in a pinch but
the smartphone that you have in your
pocket will most likely take better
photos the camera experience is mostly
the same as what you would find on a
huawei phone with most of the same modes
the only exception is the portrait mode
and the wide aperture mode which is just
a limitation of the hardware that
typically requires dual cameras which
these tablets don't have but there is a
pro mode which lets you shoot in RAW so
if you want to take the photos in post
and edit them there you'll get much
better results
the software is emui 8.0 with android
oreo 8.0 and it's basically the same
experience that you would find on their
smartphones except blown up on a larger
display so it's very iOS like with the
vibrant colors and the rounded squared
off icons the spotlight s feature and
the lack of an app drawer but you can
re-enable the app drawer in the settings
if you want specific to the m5 pro
software is the addition
of a desktop mode and desktop mode
basically gives you a more traditional
desktop like experience sort of like
Windows 10 or Chrome OS you have your
applications in the bottom left corner
and then in the bottom right you have
things like the time and your
notifications and apps open up in a
minimize double window to make it easier
to multitask the only thing that I
thought was a little bit weird about the
desktop mode is that not all of your
applications are accessible from this
mode even some of Google's applications
like the Google Play Store and YouTube
were not accessible in desktop mode so
finding a good Android tablet these days
is pretty difficult to do simply because
there aren't that many options to pick
from but if you're on the market for an
Android tablet take a look at the media
pad m5 and m5 Pro there's some of the
best Android tablets we've seen in a
long while they have great build quality
the displays are fantastic they have
long lasting battery life and the
speakers on these things are awesome
they're great for multimedia purposes
and also pretty good for work purposes
as well if you get the Pro Edition so
check these tablets out I highly
recommend them and that's pretty much it
