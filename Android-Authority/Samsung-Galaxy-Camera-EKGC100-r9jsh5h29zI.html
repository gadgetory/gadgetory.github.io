live in the ground at unpacked Berlin
it's August 29 here Eddie Fox anyway we
just got the samsung galaxy unpacked
event we're just taking a look at their
Galaxy camera it's a an interesting
product it has 21 times optical zoom it
really is the first camera of its kind
to run Android jelly bean out of the box
as you can see it is an Android device
obviously not the thinnest profile but
considering its lens and the fact that
it's packin 21 times optical zoom and a
16 megapixel image sensor it makes it
quite impressive other than that they're
using an LCD it's a four point eight
inch other than that it seems to be
fairly pressed a product it does have
Wi-Fi it does have bluetooth they are
saying that it's going to go to market
with 3G and 4G connectivity depending on
the market that you're in
we need to take some pictures they're
really really done a lot of
customization in terms of the software
but obviously it is sort of a niche
product and there's no word on when it's
going to be released over the pricing or
how you're gonna buy whether it's your
carriers or what either way it's the
Samsung Galaxy camera looks kind of cool
maybe it'll be a good seller I don't
know let us know what you guys think and
if you want to see get a little closer
we can do one for review all right this
is Darcy lack of a from Android
authority we're live on the ground here
in Berlin for Samsung unpacked 2012</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
