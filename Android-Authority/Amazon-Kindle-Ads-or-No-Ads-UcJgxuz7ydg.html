what's going on everybody
and I wanted to revisit the Kindle Fire
tablets by Amazon just to show you a
feature in real time that I kind of
touched upon in the Kindle Fire HDX
review it's the special offers version
of the Kindle Fire HD tablet that I'm
going to show you in comparison to the
one without the special offers now if
you're wondering what special offers
means essentially it's Amazon's way of
putting ads on your device in order to
keep the cost a little bit lower
however only fifteen extra dollars will
allow you to have a version of the
Kindle Fire or other Kindle devices
without these ads on them so here we're
working with two Kindle Fire HD tablets
these are not the HDX tablets this is
more of the mid-range offering that
Amazon has and yes I got two of them
because one of them has these special
offers and the other one does not so
we're going to start off with the one
that doesn't so let's just turn on the
tablet and you can see here this is the
lockscreen
I did ask somebody during a May Day
session if this lockscreen is
customizable if you can put a different
picture I was told unfortunately you
cannot and it became clear to me why
it's because this space is used by
Amazon for those special offers so now
that we got that out of the way let's
take a look at the Kindle Fire HD when
it does have special offers on now like
I said before it is pretty much
relegated to just the lockscreen you're
not going to see it anywhere else so you
have to sort of keep that in mind and
this is what it looks like when you turn
on your Kindle Fire it will have an
advertisement has the lockscreen
with the typical lockscreen slider right
there for you to get back into the
tablet and as you can see here the fire
OS still looks just about the same
there's really nothing different about
it but of course just like with any
Amazon product you're going to see those
recommendations and they're the same
ones right here so it is pretty much the
same experience that's only the
difference of the lockscreen being used
as an ad space and so that's just a
quick look at the special offers feature
that is available on Kindle tablets it
doesn't even have to be the HD or the
HDX it could also be on regular Kindle
eBook readers in all honesty I don't
find them that intrusive I have seen
plenty of comments here
they're saying that their people are
annoyed at the ABS that they see on
their Kindle Fires or their Kindle
tablets that being said however the main
idea here is that if you get a tablet
with special offers on it you save
fifteen dollars or if you think of it
the other way if you don't want those
ads you got to pay fifteen extra dollars
so it's really up to you whether or not
the price point is there and also
fifteen dollars actually isn't that much
considering that these tablets are all
pretty affordable so as always thank you
very much for watching if you want to
see the Kindle Fire HDX review there's a
link right over there on the side along
with a link to a feature focus showing
you what the Mayday feature looks like
so keep it tuned to this channel because
