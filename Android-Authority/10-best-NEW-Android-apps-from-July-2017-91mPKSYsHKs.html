Vinny the Android authority app guy and
it's about that time to round up the
best new Android apps from July of 2017
as usual if you want to check out any of
these apps for yourself you can find
those links in the video description
below
adidas all-day is a new fitness app it
can do most of the basic stuff you can
track things like running and various
other exercises and it also has support
for yoga however it's not just a fitness
app it also contains various articles
and information about eating better
being more mindful about your well being
and even techniques to fall asleep
faster it's in beta and it still needs a
lot of work but it does seem to be going
in the right direction camera roll
gallery is a minimal gallery application
with some decent features it'll do the
usual stuff you can open it check out
your photos and videos and even view
them
it lets you check your exif data and
there is also a file explorer to find
those other photos if needed the
application uses some good-looking
animations if you let it it also comes
with a few different view types it is in
beta and you can certainly see that if
you look hard enough it's a free
download with no in-app purchases flow X
technically isn't new however the
rebranding was dramatic enough for it to
count it's a weather application that
focuses mostly on the radar you can look
at a variety of different weather
phenomenon including cloud cover
precipitation temperature wind and more
you can also enable many of those layers
simultaneously the free version comes
with the basics and you can get the
additional features if you go pro your
options are a dollar ninety-nine per
year or a one-time payment of $4.99
Gracchus is a different kind of reminder
app it doesn't do things like remind you
to take out the garbage instead it
reminds you that life doesn't always
suck you fill the application with
things that you appreciate and the app
will then periodically show those to you
as notifications it also comes with
categories for easier organization the
free version gets you the base app while
the paid version unlocks more
customization features holo is an
augmented reality camera app it takes
pictures like it should but you can also
add things into the shot the app refers
to this as holo mixing it has a bunch of
stuff that you can add including movie
characters celebrities athletes
comedians musicians and a whole lot more
you can also adjust the size and move
them
a little bit if you want to it is
working through some early bugs but the
idea is kind of neat the application is
free to download kay review is the
official application of the online
service its basic function is to analyze
Amazon reviews it uses an algorithm to
tell if the reviews are legitimate or
mostly trash the application itself
doesn't do anything instead you surf
Amazon like normal you then use the
share feature on the site or in the app
to share the Amazon link to the
application itself the app then spits
out a score and that score tells you how
legit most of those reviews are it's
completely free and it takes up hardly
no space light x photo editor was a
smash hit on iOS and now the beta is on
Android it boasts a decent set of
features you can make photo collages
caricatures and cartoons it also lets
you add stickers frames blur effects and
more there are actual photo editing
features as well you can adjust various
levels color balance and even whiten
teeth and photos there is a decent auto
mode that adds enhancements on its own
you can pick up the application for free
or get the paid version for $0.99
matt'll client is an app for the my
anime list website it features near full
integration with the actual site you can
view your watch list add stuff to your
watch list manage your profile check out
various anime and a lot more it also
provides articles and videos from the
site and access to its forums private
messages and community we wish it had
logins through Facebook and Google like
the website does however it's still
pretty good
even without those things motion stills
is the latest application from Google it
actually doesn't do a whole lot you have
the option to shoot a three second video
and that video is then converted into a
jiff that you can share you can also
record a longer video and the
application will speed it up a whole
bunch that's about all it can really do
but it's a free app so it's really
difficult to complain too much there are
some bugs although we don't imagine
they'll be there very long given
Google's track record viz motto is a
lightweight Video Editor and recorder it
lets you record video and then lightly
edit that video it's not nearly as good
as something like Adobe clip or
PowerDirector however it's good for the
occasional social media post you can
trim and edit multiple videos together
if needed
it also features filters themes and
music it's not too bad for what it is
just don't let your expectations get up
there too high the application is free
too
download with in-app purchases and that
about does it for this one folks if you
like this video give it a share and let
your friends know that we exist also
don't forget to subscribe to android
authority and ring the bell to get the
latest android authority videos as soon
as they come out if you want to check
out any of these apps they aren't
available in the video description below
