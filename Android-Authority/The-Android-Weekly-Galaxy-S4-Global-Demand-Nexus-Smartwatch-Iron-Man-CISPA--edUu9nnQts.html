Carl Cedella the galaxy s4 is going to
be shipping very very soon and samsung
recently released a statement saying due
to the overwhelming global demand of the
s for the initial supply will be limited
global demand of the s4 it's a pretty
look at me statement I think so people
are lining up for the s4 like the
maldives speaking of the galaxy s4 it's
getting a new limited edition case with
iron man the Iron Man bean case 39 bucks
you getting that only Iron Man on your
galaxy phone but it also has glowing
eyes in an arc reactor when you connect
through NFC so if you look at like the
current rate of NFC adoption your iron
man eyes and arc reactor probably won't
light up ever no one uses innocent
hermes gonna be like yo a little help
over here an arc reactor the recently
passed cisco bill standing for Cyber
Intelligence Sharing and protection act
my texture in a new era of watchdogging
basically it's an amendment to the
National Security Act that's pretty
vague here's me asking someone from
National Intelligence to explain it so
what is a sis packed all about you see
it's very important and it's very
important wait that doesn't say anything
you didn't say anything I'm trying to
make you understand this is national
intelligence and national security just
try to funnel and divide alright so
we're trying to funnel privacy concerns
alright privacy concerns are still in
there or definitely aware of them you
know national security is at the top I
don't think I need to say that to
anybody national security is at the top
trying to funnel and Comcast but what
does it do she'll quick update on this
story the Senators made moment on this
cuz that bills crazy we know what's
going on privacy concerns I don't kid
you saw that guy anyways I'm out and
lastly a concept video of the Google
smartphone showed up on the internets
last week and the most weird thing about
it
seems totally doable Google is rumored
to be working on a wearable wrist
computer which by the way does not roll
off the tongue so maybe this is it or a
close approximation of what it is then I
can finally have my dick tracy watch a
little TV he had I wanted that for years
you get blank stares Dick Tracy he was
like a detective but he had like the
cool watch they made a movie but Donna
wasn't it and with that that's your
android authority weekly we'll catch you
next week the internet and Comcast over
here we got funnel this got a funnel
this action right over here then our
system Abele's here and see it just lays
right on top of all that and then you
got you just cascade you just cascade
down and hear all the all the amendments
and the privacy concerns and then you
you got your your little lock box
