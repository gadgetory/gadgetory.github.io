galaxy has three owners and those of you
who want to get the most content you can
regarding Android this is clay Nord
Android to 30.com today are gonna be
showing you some extended batteries for
the Samsung Galaxy s3 phone I've got a
pack of Hyperion batteries and they came
from amazon.com and I'm just gonna be
showing you some of the features these
extended batteries and then the charger
that came with so anyways let's power
down in our galaxy s3 swiper on and then
we will just make sure it's off before
we pull the battery out and before I get
into this I just want to warn you guys
if you guys are looking to purchase the
o'night batteries rechargeable lithium
ion they explicitly say they're for the
galaxy s3 GGI 9300 which is the model i
have don't get these because they don't
fit just pop our plastic off here really
quick and here is our original battery
and before I get into the Hyperion I
will just show you these own.i batteries
don't fit as you can see the little
metal conductors are on the opposite
side and then even if we do flip it over
it just does not go into the body of our
galaxy s3 so beware you guys don't buy
these o'night batteries anyways well get
into the good ones here these Hyperion's
just unpack into some of these now with
we read this we see here we have 2200
milliamps that's a hundred milliamps
more than the original battery here and
we have it's just about the exact same
size strong feeling that these are gonna
end up fitting so we'll just pop it in
make sure our metal conductors are
touching each other and it does fit it's
nice and snug and pop our back plate
back on and power on our device and
we've got power
it's a good sign you always want to make
sure that that happens when you put a
new battery in anyways this is our
little box it came with
has the electrical indicator some info
about that the instructions almost every
brand and rank of several militaries
blah blah blah corresponding data notes
open this up this is our little AC
adapter and battery charger it's a nice
unit has some weight to it and you can
flip out your two prongs so if we've got
our slidable battery connection and
we'll just pop this in there it's like
we can basically adjust this to any
battery we want as well as move it out
so we'll just put this here and imagine
this exactly how you charge it and then
we can plug it in so that's cool we've
got our voltages here on the back
anyways we can see here that when we get
this we've got almost full battery on
this and it seems to be working just
fine so those are our Pirie on batteries
for the Samsung Galaxy s3 yet so just
check them out you guys but I hope you
enjoyed the video guys and if you did
stay tuned with Android authority comm
for everything galaxy s3 and Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
