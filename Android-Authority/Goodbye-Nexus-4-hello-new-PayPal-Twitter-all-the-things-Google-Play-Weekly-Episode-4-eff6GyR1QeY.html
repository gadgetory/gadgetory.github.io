Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Google Play weekly this
last week was IFA which means that
Hardware stole the show but the google
play store wasn't silent either we have
some bad news about the nexus for some
great news about paypal and twitter was
everywhere so let's get started the
first thing we're going to talk about
this week is twitter because twitter had
a really busy week they started by
opening up their beta to the public for
a limited time people who got in before
it closed will get to experience
features ahead of the actual release we
think samsung might have gotten in there
because they accidentally leaked an
image of the tablet-optimized twitter
app ahead of its official release oops
the last thing that happened was the app
itself got an update in the latest
update there were the boilerplate bug
fixes and performance enhancements
however one nifty feature did come out
of this and that is a better way to
track conversations now conversations
will be connected by a blue line so you
can see the progression of the
conversation all at once so who's
excited about blackberry messenger I
didn't get into smartphones until after
that craze but I do know that if
blackberry has one asset left it's worth
anything it's blackberry messenger
recently a beta tester put on a video to
show people what the new blackberry
messenger for Android would look like
and here are a few clips from it if
you're a fan of blackberry devices then
this should all look very familiar to
you the design is pretty much exactly
like it is on blackberry OS much like
Microsoft's apps like outlook.com
blackberry is tossing hollow to the wind
in favor of its own design the best
feature revealed so far is swapping
contact info with someone using NFC just
tap the phones together and your friend
is added to your list automatically we
don't traditionally cover hardware in
the Google Play weekly show but this
week we made an exception because it was
hardware that was sold in the google
play store this week we say goodbye to
the Nexus 4 8 gigabyte edition recently
it was reduced to the absurd price of a
hundred and ninety nine dollars and it
sold out now rumors are that it's never
coming back because it's going to be
replaced by the Nexus 5 collector's item
the popular rumor going around the
internet is that google is selling the
remaining stock of nexus 4 devices so
they can make room for the nexus 5 with
all the stuff going around about the
nexus 5 android kitkat and the supposed
leaked images of the nexus 5 in the kit
kat statue video it makes
a little sense we salute you nexus 4 you
had a good run paypal is rolling out an
update and it really is quite huge the
premise is that you can now pay for
things with paypal at physical locations
straight from the app think Google
Wallet without all the US carrier
controversy I haven't gotten the update
yet so here's a quick video of the
TechCrunch guys giving it a go one of
the new features discussed is the
ability to check in to a location much
like you can on Facebook or four square
then you can order things and pay right
away from the paypal app it isn't
available at a lot of places yet but the
expansion is in progress to see the full
interview check out the stories
mentioned link below the last thing we
want to talk about this week is an
update to the BBC iPlayer app that will
let you download videos for offline
viewing the update is compatible with
Android 4.0 and up and pretty much all
devices that run android 4.0 the update
works like this you can download any
show you want to watch another high or
standard definition the video will then
have a 30-day time limit once you hit
play that limit is reduced to seven days
so you won't be able to use this to
store video indefinitely but if you need
to download some Doctor Who for the
train ride to work this will do it so
who wants to see some trending apps this
week next up are the five apps that cut
our attention the most this past week if
at any point you want to check these
apps out the links are in the video
description the first app will take a
look at this week is called sidebar plus
as you have probably guessed by now it
creates a sidebar from which you can
launch pretty much everything you can
create multiple bars on the side so you
can access apps settings bookmarks and
various other items with a quick swipe
it's pretty useful and customizable and
there is a free and paid version the
Dropbox and Google Drive are great for
storing photos but they also store
everything else as well and things can
get a little cluttered and photo feed
the only thing that ever gets backed up
our photos some features of the app or
automatic uploads from your gallery
albums and other options if you're a
photo buff and you need a place just to
keep your pictures this is worth taking
a look at eight fit is apparently never
going to die and this game called hell
the dungeon again takes advantage of
that in this dungeon crawler you
essentially just walk around and kill
the bad guys it's very simple but
surprisingly fun even for an 8-bit game
no really it's actually pretty good we
covered the release of Geekbench 3 a few
weeks ago and it's nice to see it
trending the benchmark claim to fame
the ability to properly benchmark
devices for day-to-day use instead of
the typical graphic intensive gaming
benchmarks that many people rely on
heavily there are a few problems like
Android 4.3 compatibility but other than
that people seem to like it last up is a
checkerboard strategy game called blood
battalion the premise for this game is
pretty simple you play out battles on a
checkerboard using abilities and player
types to your advantage it's quick to
play easy to learn and most of the work
gets done for you also it's free and
there's nothing wrong with that once
