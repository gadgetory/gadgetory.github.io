that really ups the ante from their last
flagship attempt it starts Trafigura
what's going on everybody and we're
taking a quick look at the brand new LG
V 30 versus the LG G 6 it's pretty
obvious where we start off here as we
can talk about the size of these two
phones LG now makes a 6-inch display fit
on the LG v 30 and it is a few grams
lighter than the 5.7 inch g6 gan is the
bulkiness of the V 20 along with that
metal backing that we actually kind of
liked but the phone is still incredibly
sleek and with that dual glass panel
design it's a very nice look that kind
of derives from the original g6 it also
feels really light and thin and it
actually is a little bit lighter than
the g6 we wouldn't really blame anybody
for thinking that the V 30 looks a
little bit like a cross between the
galaxy SA and the LG G six itself but we
do think that this is a nice step
forward for the V Sirius flagship even
if it's not fully metallic anymore the V
30 still retains a couple of features I
put it above the g6 and durability
including the milspec standard and of
course it still has the ip68
certification both phones have 18 by 9
aspect ratios in their displays however
there's a shift from the g6 to the V 30
from LCD to OLED displays it's a great
change for the V 30 and they actually
take advantage of it pretty well with an
always-on display that includes some
elements you can actually scroll through
and use there are some other clear
benefits for the V 30 which is brighter
than the g6 and also features a slightly
more pleasant color balance the specs
also put the V 30 as expected above the
g6 as the V 30 has the Snapdragon 835
compared to the g6 is a 21 for gigabytes
of RAM is standard between these two
devices though there is a V 30 Plus that
will include 6 gigabytes of RAM the g6
unfortunately only had futures like
wireless charging and the - wata
available in certain markets but both of
these features are now available on
every single device in the V 30 and
speaking of battery life both phones
come in at 3300 milliamp hours however
with the OLED screen and also the
superior processor we aren't expecting
that the V 30 will still have a good
battery life
longevity despite its larger display
which brings us to the cameras and as
the g6 and the g5 before it have proven
a dual camera setup with a wide-angle
lens can actually be a lot of fun and
the v30 continues that trend they
actually upped the ante a little bit
with a 13 megapixel wide-angle lens that
comes in at F 1.9 aperture but another
great story here is that the 16
megapixel standard angle lens has F 1.6
aperture and this is all encased in a
glass lens that absorbs more light than
the usual plastic material that is used
in other cameras the software for the
camera also provides a lot of new
features including the cine video mode
now in cine video you are able to record
basically log format video which you can
then color grade in post processing and
there is the point zoom feature here
that allows you to zoom straight into
any particular portion of the frame if
you want to add that bit of emphasis the
g6 is not really that far behind in the
camera Department as its dual 13
megapixel F 1.8 cameras are still
wonderful to use however the
advancements in the V 30 really make it
clear that LG has the cinematographer or
rather the creator in mind really if it
comes down to size we would still say
that the LG G 6 is a little bit easier
to handle overall but the LG v 30 is a
light accessible body that has so many
capabilities underneath its hood it
should come as no surprise that LG is
trying to keep all that people loved
about the g6 available in the V 30
across-the-board like the high five deck
which is incredible to use and to listen
to actually and then with the V 30 you
also get all of those tools for great
content creation so let us know what you
think how much did the LG v 30 up the
ante from the well received LG g6 let us
know how you feel about both of these
devices in the comments below and then
