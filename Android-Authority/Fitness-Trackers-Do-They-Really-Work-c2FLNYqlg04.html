personal YouTube channel the bio near
I'm not only a tech lover I'm also a big
fitness enthusiast therefore the idea of
a fitness tracker a device that combines
Tech and fitness into a single product
is right up my street getting all your
biometrics right on your wrist and
seeing your progress charters over time
is like something from a superhero movie
of course there are practical less nerdy
benefits to a fitness tracker should be
able to help you lose weight improve
your fitness and adopt healthier habits
with regards to sleeping eating
exercising and moving but does the
reality live up to the hype what is your
fitness tracker actually measuring
anyways and just how accurate is it
really fitness trackers come in all
shapes and sizes and include a wide
variety of different sensors and
features depending on the brand almost
universally though they are rather
reliant on a heart rate monitor that can
be used to calculate rough calorie
expenditure along with motion sensors
that detect movement the premise is
simple the harder your heart is working
the more you're exerting yourself and
therefore the more calories you're
burning now if you measure the calories
that are coming in via a diet app such
as My Fitness Pal you can see the
difference an attempt to maintain a
deficit so if you consume fewer calories
than you use your body turns to fat
burning and you lose weight but if you
consume more calories than you use your
body has a surplus of calories and it
stores these as fat you gain weight
it's simple maths in arguable but with
loads of problems first just how
accurate are these trackers the heart
rate monitors used in the vast majority
of trackers work for our technology
called pulse oximetry an infrared light
is used in order to penetrate the skin
and this then looks too subtle changes
in the color of the blood these colors
represent the oxygenation of the blood
which of course increases with each
heartbeat this is far from a perfect
technology though consider that many
other things can also impact blood
oxygenation or otherwise change the
appearance of the blood vessels for
instance when you're lifting weights
contractions will alter the amount of
blood reaching the limbs as well other
changes such as vasodilation this is why
chest warm polar straps are more
reliable than wrist worn devices
especially for resistance workouts
the best fitness trackers use complex
algorithms that analyze movements in
order to try and ascertain what
activities you're engaging in then they
can alter the heartrate interpretation
accordingly these are best described
though as estimates and that's not the
extent of the problem here it's also
important to keep in mind that heartrate
alone is not an ideal indicator of
calorie burn the assumption is that when
the heart pumps faster it shows that
you're creating a demand for oxygen and
energy and that's probably engaging in
an activity that's costly from an energy
perspective in reality though many
things can increase your heart rate in
fact fitter individuals actually have a
lower resting heart rates because the
strength of each heart rate is greater
allowing their hearts to beat less
frequently blood pressure air pressure
ambient temperature mood and more can
all also impact on your heart rate to be
fair good fitness trackers don't rely on
the heart rate alone the combinations of
heart rate and movement compares against
patterns derived from huge data sets via
machine learning but it is still
ultimately in an accurate picture it's
also problematic that most smartwatches
only take a measurement of your heart
rate once every few minutes or so unless
you're engaged in some kind of workout
this is intended to conserve energy
while also allowing for average resting
and maximum heart rates to be calculated
the truth though is that the amount of
calories you burn during a gym session
actually only has a small impact on your
total daily calorie expenditure far more
important are your levels of activity
throughout the day you're walking around
you're getting up you're jumping up and
down for joy your Smart Watch may remind
you to get up and walk around every now
and then but it might also miss your
quick impromptu dance routine in the
kitchen or a quick little run to get the
bus it's very possible that the real
secret to impressive weight loss is just
to be more energetic and active
throughout the day and your fitness
tracker has no way of really reflecting
this what's even more concerning though
is what is ultimately done with all this
information as said the central
hypothesis driving the SmartWatch
industry is that losing weight is a
simple matter of calories in versus
calories out this is the same view held
by many fitness experts bodybuilders
nutritionists and others but not all of
them another crowd maintains that
counting calories is actually
ineffective for a large number of the
population the answer according to this
perspective has more to do with the
metabolism
hormone balance insulin sensitivity gut
bacteria nutrient density and more these
are the people pushing intermittent
fasting ketogenic diets and the paleo
lifestyle as superior ways to get into
shape the benefits of which would again
theoretically be ignored to a large
extent by current fitness tracking
protocols so allow me to be so bold to
present my take on this divide yes it's
true that burning more calories than you
consume will result in weight loss the
problem is that we have no idea how many
calories were actually burning a lot of
the time smart watches in the calorie
counting crowd rely on a number called
and AMR to do their math this is your
active metabolic rate the number of
calories that you burn during a normal
day of activity in turn this is
calculated as your BMR basal metabolic
rate the number of calories simply
required for breathing and thinking plus
any activity engage in on top of that so
first we need to get the BMR and then we
can calculate the AMR you'll enter your
height your weight and your gender this
is necessary because taller people
require more energy just to go about
their usual business they have more body
to look after
likewise men and women also burn
slightly different amounts of calories
with women usually requiring a little
less food on a daily basis but there's a
glaring omission here that being muscle
mass you see you muscle is metabolically
active it requires energy to maintain
and to use that means that someone who
is 75 kilograms and very muscular will
burn more calories in someone who's 75
kilograms with no muscle even the strict
calorie counting crowds will attest to
this
there are ways around this you can do a
similar BMR calculation using your lean
body mass this is a much more useful
figure as far as calories burned go very
few fitness trackers will allow you to
enter this information however none that
I know I've asked for a body fat
percentage as the default when you set
them up and some even require additional
expensive purchases in the form of BMI
scales others just don't have the option
full stop and the problem runs much
deeper do you really think that all
individual differences when it comes to
calories burns can be put down to body
weight and muscle mass there any two
people who are roughly the same height
and weight will burn the same number of
calories hormone balance actually plays
a big role here if you have a higher
level of testosterone for instance and
you'll burn more calories and build more
muscle likewise thyroid hormones
levels insulin and more all also play a
role don't believe that hormones can
make much difference to your physique
and take a look at someone uses steroids
they would have the precise same numbers
as anyone else on a fitness tracker but
they'd look a whole lot different and
I'm not suggesting you're gonna use
steroids but while you might not have
the sky-high testosterone levels of
someone who uses performance-enhancing
drugs a slightly higher or lower number
against the average could still have a
minor impact on your weight loss
likewise many women who start using all
contraceptives will find that they
either gain or lose weight as a result
and again this isn't picked up by a
fitness tracker or by MyFitnessPal
similarly many health conditions like
hypothyroidism polycystic ovaries
metabolic syndrome and more can
drastically alter the way your body
utilizes energy from food again you
might not be diagnosed with
hypothyroidism but if you're struggling
to lose weight despite what the numbers
are saying you might still have a slower
metabolism than average it's better to
think of these things as spectrums
rather than binaries in many cases so in
short if it were possible to precisely
count calories going in and out then
this would lead to an accurate
prediction with regards to your weight
gain or weight loss the seeing is our
idea of how to calculate calorie burn is
probably pretty primitive the resulting
number might end up being more
misleading and helpful so both groups
are right but if all this sounds very
negative then forgive me my aim here is
not to claim that fitness trackers have
no benefit I'm actually a big fan of
them the truth is that for most people
the calorie calculations are going to be
accurate enough in order to be useful
calorie restriction is a great place to
start for anyone who wants to lose
weight and it's only when you find that
that doesn't work for you that you need
to start considering other options to
help improve your metabolism and general
health and fitness as Tim Ferriss points
out sometimes just having a single
metric to track can be incredibly
valuable even if that metric isn't
completely accurate or doesn't pay the
complete picture and that's really where
fitness trackers do come into their own
they're highly useful devices for simply
letting us track our general fitness
levels and levels of activity or to
identify areas where we could be doing
better
of course fitness trackers also do much
more than just count calories and steps
they can also be useful for training in
heart rate zones see my video on seven
minute workouts more on that they
provide sleep tracking meditation modes
and more I'm really excited for the
future of these devices - and how they
might be able to advise us on our Crona
types or look at heart rate variability
to estimate recovery projects like the
aura ring are showing promise in this
regard but by simply making us more
aware of more aspects of our health any
fitness tracker can help us to improve
in many areas of our lives that which is
measured improves just know the
limitations of that device and don't
take its word as law there's far more
going on in our bodies than they can
measure or than even we fully understand
so I hope you found this video useful
interesting guys I know it's a bit
different if you did then please leave a
like and share it around that'll help us
out immensely let me know in the
