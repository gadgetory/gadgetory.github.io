thority now we're starting to see a
trend where some smartphone
manufacturers are doing away with the
3.5 millimeter headphone jack and
relying solely on a USB type-c port well
how does that work and what does it mean
for you and for me well let me explain
so first let's look at some basics we
live in an analog world we hear sounds
through sound waves that travel through
the air and then hit our eardrum and our
brain interprets them as particular
types of sound as an analogue way now
smartphones don't use analog smartphones
use a digital system ones and zeros on
and off that's all they understand they
don't understand analog at all now when
you want to hear a piece of music there
has to be somewhere along the line a
conversion from this digital system into
this analog system now the way that
works is like this maybe you've got a
piece of mp3 music on your smartphone
our mp3 is a lossy compressed format and
what happens is your smart phone will
decode that to give you the full
uncompressed audio stream that will then
go through what's called a digital to
analog converter a DAC and that DAC
produces the analog signal which powers
your headphones now of course the
quality of that DAC depends on how well
that audio signal is produced and
different DAX have different
capabilities so today what you have is
you have your headphones plug into the
3.5 millimeter jack and when the signal
hits that 3.5 millimeter jack it's now
an all analog signal and that analog
signal then goes up the cables to power
the headphones now when you're using USB
type-c headphones things are a bit
different
now the mp3 file is decoded to produce
the full uncompressed audio stream that
goes out to the USB controller on the
smartphone into the USB controller
that's now on the headphones and then
from the USB controller on
it goes into a DAC that are in the
headphones and that DAC then does the
audio conversion which powers your
headphones so now the music when it gets
to the outside of your phone it's no
longer in analog it's now in digital and
the conversion from digital to analog
happens actually in the headphones
themselves now that has the advantage
that if your phone has a low quality DAC
you can buy high quality headphones with
a high quality DAC and that audio
conversion happens actually right next
to your ears now there is some
advantages to that because the digital
signal is traveling much further along
the chain until only at the last moment
it's converting into an analog signal
now how good that is whether you can
tell the difference that that's up to
everybody person one those people that
can't tell the difference but this on
talking about the technology this is
what happens in this situation now one
interesting question is what formats the
data flow over the USB port into the DAC
inside the headphones what android
supports what's called USB audio class
one and that's a PCM format and that's
the same as the kind of thing you find
on CD ROMs now actually there are other
formats that can be sent over USB for
example there's USB audio class - now
the purest audio purism and it will tell
us that all that class two is better
because it offers greater resolution and
there are also some proprietary
standards that different companies
different OEMs are working on now the
disadvantage of all these different
standards is it actually can mean though
in the future you might have a smart
phone that won't work with a USB
headphone because the DAC in the
headphones is expecting the data in one
format and it's coming out in a
different one
now we'll have to see how that washes
out at the end but at the moment the USB
stand are supported by Android by
default is USB audio class one now if
you do want to connect your existing
headphones with a 3.5 millimeter jack on
them how can you do that well of course
what can happen is you can have an
adapter that goes on the phone and that
adapter then gives you a 3.5 mm
a meter Jack now look that can happen in
two different ways one is that they can
actually be a USB controller and a DAC
in that adapter in a kind of a dongle
that you plug into the bottom of the
phone and that dongle does all the hard
work all the DAX going on there and then
what comes out of that is an analog
signal which then goes up to your
headphones but also instantly enough the
USB type-c specification has two pins
which can carry analog signals so in
fact all the the simplest adapter is one
that plugs in and it takes those analog
signals and just does the wiring to give
you a 3.5 millimeter jack but that means
you're relying on the DAC that's inside
the smartphone and that's fine guess
what we've been doing up until now but
it's just it doesn't give you an extra
DAC it doesn't give any control over the
DAC so now we can see they're actually
three different ways of connecting
headphones to a phone that's only got
type C one is to use usb headphones with
a DAC inside the headphones one is to
use a dongle or adapter that has a DAC
and a USB controller inside the dongle
itself and the third and simplest way is
just to use the DAC that's inside the
phone and the two analog pins that are
in USB type-c get wired into a 3.5
millimeter jack so do please tell me in
the comments below what you think about
the idea of USB type-c audio does it not
matter to you as long as your headphones
work you don't care is it really
important to you I'd be really
interested to hear your comments I'd
also like to give a shout out to Robert
Riggs because he wrote an excellent
article over Android comm that explained
all this stuff in greater detail than
I've covered in this video well my
name's Gary sim from Andrew authority I
hope you enjoyed this video if you did
please do give it a thumbs up don't
forget to follow me and Andrew authority
