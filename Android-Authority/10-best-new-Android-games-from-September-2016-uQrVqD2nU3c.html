handy the Android authority app guy and
it's about that time of month to round
up the best new Android games that were
released over the last month if you want
to check out any of these games for
yourself you can find those links in the
video description below
animation Throwdown is a fun little card
game that features characters from a
variety of cartoon TV shows your goal
will be to collect various character
cards and then battle them against
opponents there is a PvP combat mode
where you can face off against real
people online or you can take part in
the 25 chapter campaign mode that
features moments from the various TV
shows featured in the game it's a
freemium title which isn't ideal but if
you can get past that it's a fun little
game to play for a little bit our Lux
constellations is a minimal realtime
strategy game that puts you in the
middle of a big space fight you'll
control planets and then you send your
attacks over to other planets in order
to conquer them the winner is the first
person to control all of the planets on
the board it features 150 levels Android
TV support and online multiplayer there
are additional features for NVIDIA
shield owners including two free
multiplayer maps and native 4k
resolution it's free to play with some
additional stuff available as in-app
purchases both boy is a point-and-click
adventure game that has you playing as a
little green lightbulb named a bald boy
the premise is that he awakens from a
nightmare and there are bad guys
everywhere your goal will be to slay the
bad guys and save the day you'll be able
to use your powers to light up rooms
beat bad guys light up the darkness and
solve various puzzles there are secrets
galore and best of all it's a pay once
game with a cheap price tag
hovercraft takedown is a racing fighter
we'll be driving at high speeds while
doing battle with bad guys it's
reminiscent of the old road rash series
of games where you'll have a vehicle and
weapons in order to take down your
opponents this one features tons of
customizations to your ride and your
weaponry along with retro graphics tons
of glorious explosions tons of loot and
a whole lot more about the only downside
is that it is a freemium game but it's
still worth playing at least for a
little while curve flux is a minimal
puzzle game or you'll be lining up a
bunch of different waves the way it
works is you have a few waves that you
can move and you must do so in a way
that matches up with the final wave it
sounds easy in practice but it does get
quite difficult as you progress through
the levels the game is completely
to play with the in-app purchases
representing optional donations that you
could pay to the developer it should
also work well on low-end and older
devices flight flying crisis line is the
latest game in the lifeline franchise
for those who have never played lifeline
is a text-based game where you read
what's going on on the screen and then
make decisions based on that in crisis
line you'll play the role of a help text
volunteer and you'll be helping a
detective solve a particularly bizarre
murder
there will be clues to discover puzzles
to solve and people to interview it's a
pay once game although you can buy hints
if you really need them orbit is a
gravity simulating puzzle game where you
must make planets orbit around a focal
point as you progress new mechanics are
added in to make the game a little bit
more difficult the free version of this
game gives you 45 levels to complete and
each level allows you to launch as many
planets as you want there is also a
sandbox mode in the pro version that
lets you create your own levels if you
want to the graphics are simple and
minimal but it's definitely a ton of fun
particular is a platformer runner where
your goal will be to escape prison
it features minimal graphics obstacles
and other various puzzles inside of each
level to try to hinder your progress
you'll be asked to not just complete
each stage but complete it within a
certain time limit in order to master
each level there are 65 levels to play
which should keep you busy for a little
while this one is still struggling
through some early release bugs but it's
also free to play so there's no harm in
trying it out Titan HD is a new board
game for Android and it's a digital
release of an already popular board game
and Titan HD you'll be managing units
attacking opponents and trying to take
over the game board the board itself
frequently changes for an added
challenge
it supports between 2 and 6 players and
you can play local offline multiplayer
mode or online multiplayer mode if you'd
like it's a pay once game with no in-app
purchases and it's a fun little
experience if you like board games fame
glory Vulcan beta is actually a variant
of the same moment that we all know and
love the difference is that this version
comes with Vulkan API baked right in as
many of you know this is a feature in
the latest release of Android as well as
some other devices you will of course
need one of those devices to play this
version of the game and there are some
bugs because it is still in beta however
it should work well enough for the most
part if you want to try it out and that
about does it for this one folks if you
want to keep watching we have the latest
Android apps weekly show linked up there
on the screen as well as the
video description below also if you want
to check out any of these games you can
