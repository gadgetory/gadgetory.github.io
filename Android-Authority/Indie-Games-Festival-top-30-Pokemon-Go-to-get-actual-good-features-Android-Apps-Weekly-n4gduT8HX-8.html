Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome to the 156 episode of the
Android apps weekly show consequently
this is also the three year anniversary
of the show which I started all the way
back in September of 2013 in honor of
the three year anniversary we have done
some aesthetic and formatting changes
that we hope you're going to enjoy a
whole lot I didn't want to take a whole
lot of time because we do have a whole
show to go through but I didn't want to
say thank you to everybody who was
watched whether you been watching for
three years or you just sorted watching
last week your support means a whole lot
to me and I really hope you guys are
here when we hit year for with that said
let's get started Google will be hosting
a festival for indie game developers
later this month during the event indie
developers will be able to showcase
their newest games ahead of the event
google has narrowed down their list of
the best indie games that were submitted
down to 30 which will be narrowed down
even further at the festival however
most of them aren't available in the
Google Play Store just yet we'll be sure
to talk about them when they do arrive
swiftkey received a pretty big update
this last week over a month ago the
company was having some problems with
its syncing service and disabled it
entirely this week's update fully
reinstates those features included in
the update is the return of phone number
and email predictions and there are also
eight new languages and some other
smaller things it's nice to see this
problem has been completely fixed Google
Play released a short list of the top
trending apps and games from August of
2016 these are essentially the top
downloaded apps and games from the last
month some of them include prisma movius
Final Fantasy at Google duo and ESPN's
fantasy football app aside from that it
was also announced that a few new
applications including anchor FM pac-man
pop and a few other apps and games would
be released this upcoming month some
resourceful people went diving into
Pokemon goes code after the latest
update and found some actual goodies
there is evidence now to support that
niantic is working on allowing players
to trade pokemon and to battle one
another along with that clues in the
code show item variances legendary
Pokemon and something called fords that
were not quite sure about yet the game's
popularity has started to dwindle a
little bit but this could help change
that Google has officially launched
their early access program what this
means is that pretty much
any developer can release an open beta
of their application to give users early
access in order to help find bugs the
aim is to help more applications get
released that are more stable and help
eliminate those release date bugs than
us early adopters always have to deal
with you'll start seeing more of them in
the Play Store in the coming months for
sure okay folks is take a look at the
absent games that made a big splash over
the last week if you want to check out
any of these apps or games for yourself
you can find those links in the video
description below orbit is one of the
few android games that will be featured
at google's indie game festival later
this month that is also already out in
this game you'll be tasked with making
dots orbit around a black hole every new
level has a different configuration and
number of black holes that you'll have
to work around orbit uses a gravity
simulation to determine where your dots
will go and they'll be swallowed up if
you don't make the orbits just right
it's a freemium game but one of the
better ones that we've seen navbar
applications is a fun little app that
lets you customize your software
navigation keys you'll be able to make
it whatever color that you want on the
flyer you can have it mimicked the color
of whatever application that you're
using alternatively you can put images
on the navbar use it as a battery meter
or even just add a little texture it's
not a big thing but fans of
customization and damen could find a
good use for this anyone who is
interested can pick up the application
for free with the pro version running
for 99 cents as an in-app purchase
hovercraft takedown isn't really all
that new but it's another game that will
be featured at Google's indie developer
festival that you can play right now
this is a retro racing shooter you'll be
facing off against AI opponents
consequently you'll be armed to the
teeth with all kinds of implements of
destruction and you'll be able to
customize your hovercraft at will this
is a freemium game with card collecting
mechanics to further that business model
however the rampant explosions more than
make up for it crowdsource is a fun
little Google application that lets you
actually help it's an application that
lets you run through a variety of
exercises to try to make google
translate a little bit better what you
do is translate images handwriting etc
into text and then submit it to Google
because of this google translate is
supposed to get a little bit better or
at least that's the theory it's a
completely free application to pick up
if you want to help out and most of the
exercises only take a few minutes Square
Enix continues their ridiculous run of
game releases with just as monsters five
fun
fact this actually started its life as a
minigame in Final Fantasy 15 before it
was ripped out and turned into its own
mobile game this is actually a pinball
game that also has RPG and fighting
mechanics you'll launch the balls into
the bad guys with your flippers and then
they'll take damage its suffering from
some early release bugs so you may want
to wait a few updates so that everything
can be fixed up otherwise it's an okay
time killer if you're looking for one of
those for even more Android apps and
