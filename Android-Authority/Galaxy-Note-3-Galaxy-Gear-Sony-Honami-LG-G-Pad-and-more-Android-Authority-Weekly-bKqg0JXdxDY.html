brought to you by netflix head to
netflix.com / android for a free 30-day
trial with Aoife literally just a few
days away we have a lot of rumors that
will hopefully become confirmed within
the next week but for now this is joshua
guard from android authority what's
going on everybody and it's time for
another dose of the week's top android
news it's android authority weekly the
chromecast was back in the news this
week as an app that many people were
happy to use suddenly lost functionality
aircast or sometimes called all cast was
an app that allowed you to stream local
content from the gallery Dropbox or from
Google Drive created by koushik duta it
was unfortunately unable to function
properly after the latest chromecast
update given that this is the second
time streaming from external sources has
been limited duta went on record stating
that maybe the chromecast is only meant
to cast certain content even though
casting a tab from chrome is still an
option other methods have thus far been
limited maybe the chromecast won't be
quite as open as some people thought
which is a concern Google tried to
address in an official statement
basically they said that the SDK is
still in its early stages and will
continue to change so it's not about
limiting users experiences but rather
keeping in line with the current testing
schedule will have more info as this
becomes available but for now we can
only hope that this won't become a much
bigger issue samsung's next unpacked
event is literally days away right
before Aoife in berlin and we have a lot
of rumors about the devices that they
apparently have in the wings first let's
talk about the Galaxy gear it's been
reported that the watch will feature a
dual-core processor a 4 megapixel camera
actually and will run on jellybean 10
hours of battery life allegedly gets you
a lot of usage obviously these are all
rumors but we'll find out if they're
true in just a few days so stay tuned
and from there we move on to the Galaxy
Note 3 now while we were excited to see
optical image stabilization in the
camera on the note 3 this actually might
not be the case apparently OIS won't be
available due to a lack of the parts
needed to make it work it's possible
that the galaxy s5 might just get it
instead ushering in the way for
is capable cameras in 2014 maybe to make
up for it the galaxy note 3 camera will
be able to record 4k video instead but
this is just yet another rumor and then
this leaked image was released
supposedly showing a nice view of the
front panel if the bezels are really
that slim we might be in for a hell of a
display experience yes these are pretty
much all rumors but at least we know one
thing the Galaxy gear and the note 3
will officially be announced on
September fourth in Berlin so we'll have
all this information confirmed by then
and have all of the coverage available
for you at hand road authority calm if
you've gotten used to seeing the
charismatic Hugo Barra present new
google products this past year
unfortunately that's not going to be the
case anymore the vice president of
product management has moved from google
and is leaving to join xiaomi as moves
like this often happen in the world of
tech this would it normally get so much
attention however this seems to deal
with matters of a more romantic sense as
Barra tendered his resignation due to a
situation that related to the end of
romantic relationship he had with
another Googler now we're not going to
go into the details about the
relationships involved in this situation
mostly because well for the most part
it's just gossip but this is not worthy
because this is the next top level
executive to leave especially after the
recent loss of Andy Rubin there's no
doubt that John me really hit a good one
getting Barra on their team and as
Bogdan surmises in a great piece on
android authority calm we could really
be hearing a lot more about the
up-and-coming Chinese company in the
coming year ok let's get back on the
rumor mill this time about the Sony
Honami phone now known as the Xperia z1
the new phone by Sony is expected to
launch in india on September 18th sony
does have an event plant that may
announce the z1 right before Aoife and
it is then that we'll see if the phone
is really powered by the snapdragon 800
features a 3000 milliamp hour battery
and comes with the sony g lenses those
big hulking optic packages that are
supposed to be attached to the back of
your sony phone speaking of those lenses
they are expected to come in two flavors
that feature 20 point 2 megapixel and 18
megapixel sensors respectively it's
unclear what kind of release these
devices will get but at least we know
that our friends over in India will def
only see a substantial release plenty of
press images and even a video teaser are
in the wild now so the hype train is in
full force once the UNAMI phone is
announced however rest assured we'll
have it covered for you our next release
that is slated for Aoife comes from LG
and is a tablet and actually it's just
been officially announced LG is touting
the G pad as something that is made just
right and just for you sporting a 1920 x
1200 resolution display the 8 inch
tablet will be powered by the Snapdragon
600 and feature a forty six hundred
million power battery as LG has returned
to the tablet game the debut of the G
pad at Aoife might prove to be one of
the most important the company has ever
done stay tuned to android authority for
a closer look at the new LG tablet on
the floor at Aoife in berlin speaking of
tablets the new Nexus 7 by google and
asus is now available in more parts all
over the world now available in the UK
Germany France Spain and Japan the great
device out of Google and a Seuss's
collaboration reaches even more markets
but that wasn't all Google was up to
speculate all you want about what this
move may actually mean the bottom line
is that the nexus 4 is now even more
affordable at a hundred dollars less now
for 199 dollars you can get one of the
most beloved smartphones of the past
year easier than ever and finally it
might seem a little premature to talk
about the galaxy s5 right now but when
someone tells you that it might not be
made of plastic you prop up and listen
we already talked about this supposed oh
is feature in its camera but then a
report stated that it could feature on
metal chassis at the most a sample has
been sent to production factories but is
far from being even tested we're still a
long way from any confirmation regarding
anything galaxy s5 but this is certainly
a nice first bit of buzz as always thank
