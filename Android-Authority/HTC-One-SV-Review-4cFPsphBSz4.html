recent trend of very solid mid-range
phones running dual-core Qualcomm
processors is the HTC One SV a worthy
competitor or just a plot by HTC to keep
confusing us with its naming conventions
find out in our review hey everybody I'm
Chris look now while it's got its own
style and software the HTC One SV is
pretty similar to other phones we've
looked at recently both in its
performance and in its hardware how
similar is it well let's take a look at
the specs the HTC One SV runs a 1.2
gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon processor
and has a 4.3 inch WVGA display it has
one gig of ram eight gigs of internal
storage expandable via microSD the rear
and front facing cameras are 5
megapixels and 1.6 megapixels
respectively all of this is powered by a
1,800 milliamp hour battery the look of
the HTC One SV is pretty similar to some
other models in the one line of HTC
phones though the body isn't quite as
bulky so my review unit was in white but
the One SV is available in a range of
different colors generally I don't like
the design quite as much as some other
HTC devices but it's still fairly
stylish build quality is usually a
strong suit with HTC phones and the One
SV is no different in this case though
it's fairly white it still feels very
sturdy though I don't know how well it
would survive the drop test the phone
fit very nicely in my hand and the
buttons feel well laid out the weakest
aspect of the HTC One SV is definitely
its display with a pixel density of 217
pixels per inch you're definitely going
to end up with some items not being
rendered as sharply as they could be
that said the screen is bright and
colors are vivid so it's not like we're
looking at an entirely low-end display
here dual-core snapdragon do a great job
of bringing decent performance to
mid-range phones and that is definitely
the case here
and two to three tons and average the
scores ending up with an average figure
of around ten thousand nine hundred
running Epic Citadel and benchmark mode
produced similar results with the high
quality setting producing around 48
frames per second and the high
performance setting yielding 50 frames
per second scrolling through home
screens in the app drawer was always
smooth apps all we launched quickly and
games performed pretty well despite the
occasional hitch in performance the 1sv
runs Android 4.0 point 4 Ice Cream
Sandwich skinned with HTC Sense 4.1
we've heard that an update to jelly bean
and sense four plus might be on the way
but I had no such luck during testing
there were a lot of apps pre-installed
and while some definitely following in
the category of bloatware a surprising
number of them are actually pretty
useful like the flashlight mirror voice
recorder and FM radio apps you may not
use these all the time but they're
definitely more useful than a lot of
pre-installed apps we've seen I never
really expect amazing results out of the
cameras and mid-range phones which means
I'm usually not too disappointed this
worked out for the 1sp the 5 megapixel
rear camera isn't too bad and can
definitely take a decent photo low-light
performance in particular was better
than expected HTC is thrown in HD our
best shot and a few other useful
features the 1080p video capture is
fairly decent with generally the same
image quality is still shots and HTC has
included the fun but not too useful
slo-mo mode Snapdragon chip sets are
usually good at getting the most out of
a battery so the 1,800 milliamp hour
capacity of the One S V's battery isn't
something to worry over during heavy
testing I still ended up with just over
8 hours of battery life and in more
normal use the phone easily lasted a
full day without charging surprise
surprised the battery is actually
removable which isn't something I
usually expect an
HTC phones being able to carry a spare
battery you're using extended batteries
always handy so right now we have a lot
of similarly SPECT phones coming out at
similar price points and it seems like
that's going to keep happening so what
makes them all different the design with
the One SV by keeping the design similar
to some of its other more popular phones
HTC is betting on already-established
design it works for me but your mileage
may vary now if you'd like to know more
