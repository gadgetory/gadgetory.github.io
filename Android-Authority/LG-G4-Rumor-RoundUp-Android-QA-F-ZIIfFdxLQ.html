brought to you by domain.com so we have
lots more recently surrounding LG's
flagship offering so this is an updated
version of the LG g4 rumor roundup first
let's start with design since the
arrival of the LG g2 LG has been
incorporating the rear button power
volume design into just about all its
devices with the LG g3 LG took the
iconic design and infuse some major
refinements into the aesthetics while
also introducing a metal looking plastic
back that gave the phone a more premium
look a few weeks ago LG started teasing
the g4 with an official launch date
announcement that gave us a hint at what
the material device could be made of
leather the launch date teaser photo
didn't bear a whole lot of detail but we
received some more clarification when
the company began talking about the g4s
camera in this teaser we were given an
image that could turn out to be the back
of the g4 now it's unclear whether g4
will incorporate genuine leather like on
the model acts 2014 or faux leather like
on the samsung galaxy note 4 according
to the rumors and speculation we've seen
thus far the alleged press images of the
new handset are at least believable now
let's talk about the display a few
rumors from a couple of weeks ago hinted
that LG could potentially launch the
device with a curved display like on the
G flex 2 but LG did give us some
clarification on the display the company
announced its new 5.5 inch IPS LCD
display with a resolution of 2560 x 1440
that would launch on the g4 despite the
obvious similarities of the quad HD
display on the g3 LG says that this new
display is a quote quantum jump in terms
of key features including color gamut
brightness contrast ratio touch function
power consumption and thinness now let's
get to the belly of the beast and talk
about the phone specs according to the
korea times the g4 will use a qualcomm
snapdragon 808 system-on-a-chip rather
than the a-10 additionally the recent
gfxbench listing also points to an 80
weight system on a chip there's no
telling exactly why LG would use
80 weight over the 810 but some recent
speculation entertains that LG may be
waiting until the launch of the
higher-end smartphone to use the more
powerful a ten additionally the
Snapdragon 810 has had some reputation
issues due to claims of overheating
aside from this there's been little talk
about the sensors and other features
that may be on the device while LG
avoided the fingerprint scanner crazed
thus far with more players coming on
board that train perhaps LG will finally
join the likes of Samsung and others now
all you shutter bugs will be happy to
know that LG revealed in an official
teaser video that the g4 will feature a
16 megapixel rear facing camera with an
f-stop of 1.8 aperture and an 8
megapixel front facing camera and now
the lower the f-number the greater the
aperture opening is and the more light
can reach the sensor for each shot this
is extremely important for taking
low-light shots in fact the 16 megapixel
camera will be able to take in eighty
percent more light than the g3's camera
for comparisons sake the new Samsung
Galaxy s6 has an aperture of 1.9 the HTC
One m9 has an aperture of 2.2 and the
iphone 6 also has 2.2 aperture as well
aside from the camera software features
this is turning out to be one heck of a
camera now let's talk new software
features and LG is claiming to have a
more human centric you I LG has released
a teaser video for the new UX
four-point-oh quote the human centric
you why that aims to make your software
experience simpler and easier and
judging from the video we know that the
UX por Punto will have two new features
one is manual focusing for the camera
and improvements for the smart notice
application the screenshot that we've
provided here shows off the home screen
that is much more flattened than the
past in durations of software with
inspiration taken from Google's material
design guidelines for the color palette
now let's get to the rub and talk
release date and pricing just over a
week ago LG began rolling out official
invites for the g4 unveiling on April
twenty-eighth events will take place on
the 28th in New York London Paris and an
April 29th in Seoul Singapore and
Istanbul it's worth mentioning that when
it comes to pricing the LG g3 debuted at
a pretty aggressive price point for a
high
and flagship it wouldn't be too
surprising to see the LG g4 follow suit
this means a price range of 500 to 600
and fifty dollars so what do you guys
think would you just get one of the
flagships that's out right now or wait
for the LG g4 I would argue that if a
camera is really important to you
especially an 8 megapixel front-facing
camera you might want to wait for the g4
