Jace and this is where we try and answer
your most pressing Android questions and
I'm sure many of you have watched all
the HTC m8 reviews some things you like
some things you don't you've weighed the
pros and cons and you're still sitting
on the fence ow ow ow ow ow our heart
sabaha but that's okay because here at
Android authority we feel your pain and
that's why we are going to go a little
deeper into the top question surrounding
this beloved phone right and the top
question everyone has is regarding those
beautiful front-facing speakers so
compared to the original HTC one how
much better is the m8 s-- front-facing
speakers well the speakers have been
improved to bring about 25% more volume
and even richer mids and lows and they
stand up to that task pretty well it's
not hard to hear what you're playing
even when you're on a busy street as a
result sharing media with friends is
even better on the m8 than the original
HTC One phone calls come in nice and
clear with no drops and strong signals
all around but we have to admit that
when Josh reviewed the phone he found
himself using the boomsound speakers
more often than not now for those of you
who have the m8 on the Sprint network
there's some special goodies for you
HTC and Sprint introduced a special
edition of the HTC One m8 that features
a unique design and sound enhancing
technology created by Harman Kardon the
legendary audio company this special
version of the HTC One m8 uses two
different techniques to output high
fidelity sound when playing compressed
files clarify is said to improve the
quality of a compressed file by
analyzing the song and reconstructing
the highs lows and reverbs in real time
for richer sound is that just hype or
not if any of you have the HSM 8 on the
Sprint network I would love to hear your
thoughts on that does it really sound as
good as they claim because that sounds
fantastic I'd love to hear your
first-hand experience next question is
all about battery yes what is the
real-life battery life like on the HTC
m8 when it comes to the battery its
capacity alone might not
Press anyone but the non-removable 2600
milliamp hour battery manages to last
for quite a long time in a couple of
instances Josh used the phone for hours
on end for tasks like navigation and
playing music and never did feel the
pressure to get the charger even by the
end of the day the good battery
performance can be pushed even further
with the power saving features that are
available on the device now Josh did
report a she sees pretty audacious claim
that on a five percent charge you could
get almost 15 hours of standby time that
is pretty crazy for HTC to say that and
so I wanted to ask as many users who
have some first-hand experience with the
phone not just a couple days but a
couple weeks and get their experience of
the battery life and it's concerned
because I got a wide range of answers
people who said they were really pleased
with it loved the battery life another
people said they were really
disappointed with it it's hard to
measure because everyone uses their
phone differently but one thing that was
really common
everyone said employ all the battery
saving features that the phone employs
use them all that is going to have a
noticeable effect now what I did is take
an informal poll of HTC One m8 users who
I know personally and on Google+ and see
what their battery usage or battery
experience was like with the m8 and I
got a wide range of experiences people
who were really impressed with the
battery and very pleased with it could
easily get more than a day with moderate
to high usage other people who had quite
the opposite experience and could not
get a full day with even moderate usage
so it's pretty clear though that
everyone says you really want to employ
all the battery saving features on the
phone but I found out some more
independent information from trusted
reviews.com you can see here that they
had the phone charged just over 50% and
they played sd quality video playback
with Wi-Fi off and screen brightness set
to 50% for just under five hours now
they got about one hour more than they
did with the original HTC One so pretty
darn good not fantastic but you really
do want to employ all the battery saving
options next question is regarding
blinky
is blinkfeed really useful one of our
viewers said I really like how it blends
whatever topics I've chosen into a mixed
stream of interest and they also mix in
my social network messages with news
stories to make it feel like it's truly
my personal feed of the things I care
about so you should know that I also
quiz Josh on this and he felt that yes
blinkfeed was worth it provided that you
were willing to put in the work to
customize it and refine it to your own
personal likes and needs if you had done
that he thinks it's better than any
magazine widget or magazine app out
there so the final question is with
regards to the HTC m8 camera and I have
been highly critical of the camera in
the past I've softened on that a little
bit so just to review very quickly the
phone has a four megapixel rear facing
camera and a five megapixel front facing
camera that is unlike almost any phone
that I know out there where the
front-facing camera has a higher
megapixel count than the rear facing
camera meaning that pictures of yourself
are more important than the pictures you
take of the world around you pretty
counterintuitive for someone like me I
have softened on that a little bit
because I understand the HTC m8 is
trying to create a DSLR like image for
the average user and if that's their
goal they have largely succeeded at that
if you don't want to crop your photos
and you know low-light performance is
important to you this could be a great
phone I'm a big fan of Alex Lindsay of
the pixel core and he's he's a hardcore
geek and he loves the camera on this
phone and he uses it constantly so I had
to reconsider my opinion and look at a
little differently it's maybe not the
best camera for me but for many of you
it might be fantastic thanks for
