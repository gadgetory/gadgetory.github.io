goes from side to side and they are
hoping that this new form factor will
provide a couple new functions well
let's see what the curve does for this
new horizon for the galaxy line age Josh
regard from andhra authority what's
going on everybody and this is the
samsung galaxy round a 5.7 inch screen
makes for a phone that is pretty similar
to the Galaxy Note 3 especially in size
pretty much this is nice it's a classic
Samsung layout with the button layout
including the home button up front
flanked by back and menu the back of the
phone employs a textured plastic that
mimics leather and is a wonderful step
away from the old glossy plastic of all
the devices pretty much that came before
the samsung galaxy note 3 the textured
plastic that made it onto the galaxy
note 3 makes it onto this galaxy round
and it's just a really nice feeling
material that makes the phone feel very
comfortable in the hand especially with
that curved as such the sides do seem
quite thin but once you have the phone
in your hand you'll feel that the centre
of the phone is a little bit heavier
than the rest and these curves do allow
for some leaning when you have the phone
sitting on a table which does make for
some new functionality ultimately though
the main function that you'll find when
it comes to the curve is that it sits
very nicely in your hand after all when
you have the phone in your hand it
definitely just contours to the curve
that your fingers would make or your
palm and your fingers would make when
holding this phone but it also raises
the side someone making full screen
reach actually better it's a bit
surprising to actually be able to clear
the entire screen via that one-handed
grip essentially what you're looking at
here is a slightly more compact version
of the Galaxy Note 3 it's almost as if
somebody left the Galaxy Note 3 out in
the hot Sun and this was the end result
the phone just kind of curled up a bit
due to the sun damage no this won't
actually happen to your phone if you
leave it out in the Sun Samsung brought
in its Super AMOLED technology this time
size that five point seven inches with a
bit of a curve on the sides as we've
been saying however it also brings
Samsung's of good quality experience
this screen is capable at 1080p
resolution at 386 PPI
and when it comes to the colors they are
expectedly oversaturated but when you go
into the options you are able to
customize the look of these colors if
you want to tone them down a little bit
there's no doubt that in the galaxy
around Samsung proves how good they are
would display is once again the
sharpness is still great for all texts
and all media shines through because of
that good color reproduction also with a
Super AMOLED display you have a little
bit better contrast so really any media
and even your games are going to look
quite good on this screen unlike the LG
counterpart the LG G flex the curve
doesn't necessarily skew any images or
really anything that you see on the
screen you pretty much don't recognize
the curve happening when you're watching
say videos on YouTube however Samsung
did try to make the motif kind of play
out a little bit in the UI seeing as the
screens sort of push back a little bit
and then move over sort of giving that
illusion that the curve is actually
making a difference the only kind of
weird development you'll see when it
comes to the screen is through the
reflections when the screen is often you
have the phone sitting on a table you
might glance over at it and it gives you
a warped image of anything that it's
reflecting it's almost as if you're
experiencing vertigo but literally only
when you're looking at the galaxy around
the increasingly common Snapdragon 800
clocked in at 2.3 gigahertz brings its
expected power this time to the galaxy
round and it is backed by the Adreno 330
and 3 gigabytes of RAM a development
that did make its debut originally on
the Galaxy Note 3 TouchWiz then moves
along about as fast as it ever has 3
gigabytes of RAM allows the galaxy route
to perform a lot of multitasking pretty
seamlessly including the usual multi
window which is one of those features
that works really well on a screen as
big as this when we make it to the
hardware section we find that much of
what makes a bacin devices pretty
attractive in the first place continues
in this new iteration for example 32
gigabytes of on-board storage is
expandable via the micro SD card slot
easily found underneath that back cover
and then we find a very full-featured
said that has become a general trope of
flagship Samsung devices that include an
IR blaster for watch on capabilities for
controlling your TVs and set-top boxes
and even the sensors that are used
is how to check your general
surroundings now for really talking
about features that are either in or not
in the galaxy round obviously we've been
making comparisons due to the size of
this phone to the Samsung Galaxy Note 3
so if we're gonna continue on that path
we will say that pretty much the only
thing this phone is missing in terms of
the Samsung lexicon is the s-pen so you
have pretty much every other feature the
sensors for air gestures and air views
but if you don't use the stylus at all
this might be an alternative to the
Galaxy Note 3 for you call quality was
pretty unsurprisingly good with no real
complaints going in either direction for
my voice or the voices on the other line
when it comes to the main speaker it
does get quite loud and the sound is
actually not too bad but the higher the
volume is the less fidelity you'll get
in the sound when it comes to battery
life you do get this somewhat newly
shaped battery inside of the galaxy
round it has been elongated in order to
accommodate the new shape of the phone
and it also comes in at a bit of a lower
capacity for a phone about this size we
do have a battery here that comes in
have below 3000 milliamp hours indeed
this one comes in at 2800 which actually
in the long run of things doesn't really
change the battery life too much on this
particular phone for the average user I
see no reason why they couldn't get
close to two days out of the galaxy
around with some pretty frugal usage
there was even a spare battery and a
separate charger that was included with
the unit that I have right now but I do
understand that this is not something
that usually happens for every single
device and then we make it on over to
the camera
this 13 megapixel shooter does bring the
quality that you could pretty much come
to expect from Samsung devices if you
have used a camera in the past on a
flagship Samsung device you pretty much
know what to expect here you also do
expect that in the app you get a lot of
different ways of getting different
kinds of photos so there's a lot of ways
for you to get creative when it comes to
your smartphone photography the app is
also quite fast at least it's about as
fast as we need it to be allowing for
some quick shooting the shutter to file
speeds are pretty good allowing you to
get off a few really quick shots in good
succession and of course the picture
quality is pretty expectedly good much
like the Galaxy Note 3 and the galaxy s4
before it colours have a pretty good
colour reproduction and
details are pretty crisp especially from
this 13 megapixel shooter ultimately if
you happen to have used a camera from
before like I said then you pretty much
know - what to expect here especially if
you liked the most recent offerings of
cameras on Samsung flagship devices then
you're gonna like the one that's found
on the galaxy round TouchWiz TouchWiz
TouchWiz of course when Samsung puts out
a lot of different devices we get to
know the operating system quite well on
every single one of them and if you have
grown quite tired of Samsung's user
interface it does continue to appear on
their phones bringing more and more
features every single time so what does
that mean for the galaxy round well
before we get into those we will say
that many of the new features originally
introduced in the galaxy s4 make it onto
this new galaxy iteration air gestures
air view and even the smart pause and
scroll make it into the bevy of
functionality that's available in this
phone so when it comes to this side to
side curve on the galaxy round what new
features did Samsung conjure up from it
well I did cover those features in a
previous feature focus video focusing on
the tilt functions now when it comes to
these particular functions I think that
the most useful ones are probably the
quick glance where you tilt the phone a
certain way in order to see a quick
glance at your notifications though
there is a bit of a pause from when you
actually tilt the phone to when you see
the actual notifications I think if you
have the air gesture where you just wave
your hand over the sensor it might be
even a little bit faster than the quick
glance tilt and then after that you can
change the track on the music player by
tilting it to the left or right however
much like many other features found on
Samsung devices this only really works
on the Samsung specific music player but
as is the question with pretty much
every Samsung device these days it is
whether or not those functions are
practical for you that might be the
selling point release details on this
particular device are still pretty fuzzy
but since this is Samsung's newest
flagship device we can pretty much
expect it to come out on all of the
major carriers and when it does it will
likely come in at those typical high-end
price points along with perhaps the
two-year contract
and so there you have it for this
brand-new flagship in Samsung's camp the
Galaxy round manages to make a big note
size device slightly easier to use and
in reality that is somewhat valuable
where one might find some questions when
it comes to value is obviously in the
feature set the curves don't really
translate to very groundbreaking new
functions making this essentially a
compacted Note 3 without an s-pen for
the most part that is the way you can
look at the galaxy round don't get me
wrong this is still a phone that is very
enjoyable to use it brings all of the
good Samsung quality that we've come to
expect along with a couple of new
features based on that curve and when it
comes to that curve it does allow this
phone to be a little bit easier to
handle than you would have expected and
that is actually pretty refreshing
however ultimately at the end of the day
it just feels like it feels too much
like a Galaxy Note 3 without ever using
the s-pen and given that there are so
many users out there who do exactly that
perhaps the galaxy round has carved out
very narrowly a new niche and if that's
something that actually appeals to you
well then this is a device you can
definitely look at as always thank you
