quick closer look at Lenovo is 5.5 inch
device no release they set on quite yet
but it is a packin a 1080p display
Android 4.1 of the box on the rear we're
looking at a 13 megapixel camera also it
should be noted that this device does
include expandable memory which is
really really cool for device that's
only six point eight millimeters thin no
word on the battery life yet but I'm
thinking that probably gonna be able to
pack around 2400 millibars which might
sure changed a little bit other than
that like I said 5.5 inches a packing
dual core technology from Intel
it's the clover trail variety and it's 2
gigahertz which is interesting
considering they're only running single
core having claimed that Android isn't
optimized for dual core multi-core SEPs
quite yet now in the hand obviously it
is a little more substantial in the
galaxy note but really not by much just
a little bit higher it has obviously a
really nice metallic or a rectangular
type design other than that looking to
be really really impressive
just as thinness its lightness it's
probably about 20% lighter than the
galaxy note 2 obviously it is an LCD
display 440 pixels per inch 2 megapixel
camera on the front and a 13 megapixel
on the rear whereas the galaxy note
always says 1.9 megapixel and 8
megapixel on the rear but compared to
comparatively it's just so much thinner
it's really really hard to fathom it's
basically 30 40 % there in the galaxy
note 2 so no word in release date no
word on pricing but they told us that
they're really interested in expanding
to the North American market obviously
includes the nose UI but I think that
we're gonna expect some really good
things from Lenovo here in 2013 a big
fan of their notebooks not a big fan of
the Windows 8 tablets but that's okay
other than that yeah just quick verses
for you guys a little stay tuned we'll
get a review for you know as soon as we
can start still a cuvette from Android
thority thanks for checking in guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
