it's Android authority here we're live
on the ground from Hong Kong bringing
you the world's first realistic drop
test of the brand spankin new iPhone 5
the device we'd love to hate and the
world's best-selling Android phone the
Samsung Galaxy s3 so basically guys we
want to explain the philosophy of this
drop test so what we're trying to do
here is bring you the most realistic
possible drop test so that involves
three different drops first we're going
to drop it out of the pocket as we pull
the device out which is the most typical
use case scenario when people actually
drop the device from there we're going
to drop it from about four feet high
when a person raises it up to the side
of their head a lot of people also tend
to drop it from there as well and lastly
we're going to let it slip out of the
hand at five foot six I'm five foot nine
so it's around five foot six to show how
it handles impact from such a height all
those three things combined will paint
the most realistic portrayal of how
people tend to drop their devices and
will be able to test the durability of
the brand new iPhone 5 and the Samsung
Galaxy s3 oh my goodness first part of
the drop test right from the pocket
alright guys let's just see how it fared
from the reverse initial drop test
alright so no shattering on the display
a really good sign but it looks like we
have a little bit of scratching to the
side here but it does seem to have fared
quite well other than that very minimal
damage all things considering but it was
from only two feet six inches so let's
see how this three dozen now a iPhone
five drop test here we are guys let's do
it with the s3 from the pocket two feet
six inches
realistic as possible
okay let's check it out okay it appears
that there was no damage sustained to
the LCD whatsoever
still functioning fully in terms of
scratches what not just a little bit to
the side here nothing too major in fact
uh yeah I mean very very minimal damage
a little bit here on the side as well
other than that no scratches to the LCD
itself it appears to be in remarkably
good shape here we are going to drop it
from mid height from four feet
alright look to drop on the side but
less
the moment of truth okay now in terms of
actually how fair alright so actually
relatively minimal damage as we can see
the point of impact is here it looks to
almost fracture the plastic a little bit
here you can see that the metal itself
has been a quite dented but no real
serious damage out to the display itself
the display is still working yeah so
very minimal damage all things
considering so the iPhone 5 fared quite
well actually from that particular that
height four feet here we go guys going
to drop the s3 from four feet high mid
level
oh my goodness Oh My Damn Oh No okay
guys that side impact you know it's just
a killer the plastic is completely
fractured does the display itself still
work that's still working so it's still
functional getting these displays
replaced cost around $300 so that's 300
bucks we just plunk down for you guys
hope you like it
but yeah the plastic is completely
fractured I can almost pick it off with
my hand here this is the impact on the
side you can see the impact just spread
across the whole display and it
completely cracked alright guys so the
iPhone 5 is held up very well so far but
here's the moment of truth going to drop
it from five foot six at the air let's
see how it goes
you know I've really got to hand it to
Apple device itself is still functioning
let's see where the moment of point of
impact was
all right it appears so yeah you know
it's a really learn cloud device I just
to stay a little bit of damage on the
side we had the first the second point
of impact was here and the first point
of impact was actually excuse me this
appears to be actually the point of
impact and whereas you know from the
galaxy s3 is smash the iPhone 5 appears
to sustain relatively minimal damage the
LCD itself is still completely
functioning it's just minor aesthetic
damage to the bezel itself which is made
of a hard composite metal so yeah iPhone
5 felt very very well all right guys
Samsung Galaxy has three time again
we're going to drop it from the height
of my ear to retrain realistic drop test
scenario I will be five foot six of the
year and let's just see how it fares
so as we can see yeah just from the side
here it did crack a little bit more it
appears as though yeah the impact was
here on the side which cause the glass
to fracture a little bit more but it
just compounded the fractures to the
point where they extend all the way down
the device itself to the rear yeah
obviously not very much damage the case
really no one cares about it's just
cheap plastic really anyway but yeah the
screen itself is still functioning so
that's a really good sign the internals
are obviously okay but it just
compounded the impact uh and just made
all the cracks just go down a little
farther down the length of the display
so Samsung s3 unfortunately is in pretty
tough shape right now relative to the
iPhone 5 I am the iPhone 5 held up well
during the drop test my god so we're
going to give it the ultimate drop test
smackdown
we're going to raise it up to about as
tall as I am about five foot nine 5 foot
10 and we're going to do a face down
drop to see if this is actually as
durable as Apple wants us to believe so
here we go guys ultimate drop test
Smackdown iPhone 5 Hong Kong diam
alright guys so let's see how the iPhone
5 fared very impressive guys so
basically no damage to the display at
all no cracking all we have is some
minor aesthetic dents that happened from
the point of impact when it hit the
ground
other than that yeah like I said fully
working very very impressive you know
almost from 6 feet from 5 foot 9
obviously no more glass plate on the
back compared to the iPhone 4s and
whatever kind of glasses are using for
the front is extremely durable because
we've dropped it over four times now and
it isn't cracking at all still fully
functional so here we are round ride
Authority we're live from Hong Kong
showing you the iPhone 5 drop test
versus the Samsung Galaxy s3 which I
have just here which obviously as you
can see this is seeing quite a bit of
damage from two different drops so you
take a pic iphone 5 vs samsung galaxy s3
apple iphone Kong</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
