handy the Android authority app guys
strategy games come out all the time but
the good ones seem to last forever which
ones are the good ones on Android that's
what we're here today to tell you not
all great strategy games need a catchy
name one such example is the first app
on our list called great big war game
this simple and fun little strategy game
puts you in control of a number of
troops and vehicles that you must then
use to defeat your opponents each piece
has their strengths and weaknesses so
you must pay attention to which ones you
use where campaign mode and all the
single-player modes are pretty fun
however we had the most fun playing the
online multiplayer recent moves back and
forth to an opponent like a chess game
next up is land grabbers this strategy
game is all about quickness as opposed
to just strategy you play as a small
army based in one spot and you must send
your troops to other places conquer them
then use those places as staging points
for further attacks it's a pretty simple
premise but it's also quite hard to
master getting the lieutenant ranking
and every map is pretty easy for getting
the next ranks up can be challenging the
games go by in just a couple of minutes
making this not only fun but also quick
to play our longtime viewers may
remember ninja village because it's been
featured as a best app of the month
before this strategy game is part
village building sim and part strategy
game that is both a challenging and
addictive the main storyline has a time
limit of about 17 hours however even if
you don't make it by then you're allowed
to continue the game you build your
village and use the resources to build
your ninja army you then use it to beat
up on other ninja armies don't worry old
school gamer fans we didn't forget about
you next on our list is a unique
text-based game called time of
exploration the strategy game lets you
create a whole civilization by building
things as necessary to help your economy
improve it is all text-based which means
no graphics whatsoever so if you're the
kind of person that likes graphics you
probably won't like this game otherwise
it's a pretty challenging and fun text
game that makes you think more than it
makes you watch despite its lack of
graphical content the depth to this game
is truly impressive
last on our list is warlords RTS this
game revolves around a central hero that
you go from mission to Mission with to
kill bad guys it's similar to a tower
defense game wherein there is a castle
you must defend along with a castle you
must destroy however it does play a lot
more like a strategy game than a tower
defense game you play as the hero and as
the battle goes on you earn
you use these coins to summon minions
which you then use to kill bad guys and
raise buildings you have to be careful
because as stated if the bad guys get
behind you and destroy your castle it's
game over if you take a gander at our
leaderboard you can see how all these
strategy games stack up against one
another keep in mind that this is not
how we rated them but how you the people
have rated them there is no bias on our
part if you want to check them out you
can find the app links in the video
description this was a difficult list to
do because of the loose definition of
strategy and all of the subgenres that
fall into the category of strategy for
instance we didn't include any tower
defense games because we felt that it
deserved its own list as always if
there's a great game that we missed then
please let us know in the comments there
are hundreds of good ones out there and
there's every chance that we may have
missed one of them once again I'm Joe
