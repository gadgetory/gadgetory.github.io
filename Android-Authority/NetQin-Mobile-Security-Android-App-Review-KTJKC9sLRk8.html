authority will be doing the next mobile
security app review you can find this in
the android market for it's a free price
in the android market and you can also
get the pro version which will get on to
later on let's enter the app itself now
next in Mobile Security I do have to say
that my phone was a little bit laggy
today not from this app but it was from
a couple of apps so the first thing I
really want to get into is just it's a
mold security app then you can backup
information privacy protect things virus
scan so you really won't have a lot of
malware viruses so we're going to get
into a fast game right now just like I
just clicked on the top by clicking fast
scan this will scan for around probably
around fifty seconds to 60 seconds I've
done it in 30 seconds before as you can
see my phone is lagging but it's really
nothing this app it's a little bit about
this app it's really trusted in my
opinion I've been using it for a couple
days now and I really knows the
difference in well just I felt safer I
like the some of the some of the
features on it but we'll get into in a
few minutes as you can see it just
finished in around 40 seconds I have no
viruses of malice I really don't need to
worry about any of the apps being
infected with any sort of virus so I
don't really have to check any of these
boxes here go back and I'm going to go
straight into the privacy protection now
piracy protection is basically the
requirements of some applications so if
I go into contacts here it will show the
apps that require contact information
message location twice info we're going
to go into the anti lost part now so
anti losses basically when you misplace
your phone you can find out where it is
on a desktop application called and Hugh
space which we'll get into also in
and part of this video which is really
helpful if you ever lost or misplaced
your phone on the desktop icon will get
into it's really simple it's really easy
to create account and you can also log
into it on this phone as you can see we
just went into back contacts back up
where you can backup context restore
contacts and account manager these can
be backed up on the current device and
also restore it on a newer device say if
you lost it broke the phone whatever it
can be restored because you're also
logged in so these accounts that you
create with next-gen is really important
because it will keep all your
information securely in one place so no
matter what device you switch to you
should have no problem is because the
amount currently logged in shows my
context then we'll go to around system
optimization and basically a system
optimization is allows me to kill apps
show the running apps have an app
manager and show also the raw maps so
basically i'm running a rom on route
these are the apps that require Roche
and we'll show those allows me to delete
them if I want because when you rooted
you know you're a little less secure
because you're you can download more
third-party we just went into network
manager now it's a data usage tool which
allows you to look at well anything that
you just use so it will show me my data
usage for today and also the month you
can set a monthly quota I set my into a
thousand megabytes which is around a
gigabyte most of the plants today are
two gigabytes enough for around thirty
dollars depending on which carrier you
switch to I'm currently on an unlimited
plan so I really don't need this tool
but a lot of people that are switching
to new phones and new plans will need
this tool to on pretty much be
successful and not going over your phone
bill and of course the graph is pretty
low because I really just redownload
this app a couple times but it's really
worth it this is also a update virus
database which allows you to pretty much
update just about anything so we just
went into the pro member zone and this
is the plan for it so pro is basically
you 699 for six months for the highest
plan this will allow you to do many
things pro has anti eavesdropping has a
lot of more features with auntie Claus
Pro features financial security and
automatic virus database updates so why
would these a virus a the base updates
be you know important is we'll get into
that a little later on but so it's it's
really not just a hassle of you going
into the app all the time there's also
probably one last thing I'd like to show
you is going into the arrow there you
can get a couple of scanning features
such as customized and full scans so
really hope that covers up a lot of the
information in this video so we're going
to go to a an application called NQ
space which is a desktop application
that allows you to synchronize with this
application we'll see you there we're on
something called NQ space 1nq spaces it
basically connects with your neck shin
app in your niche an account for your
device and shows it all right in the
computer it also gives you features like
anti laws security contacts backup as
well and shows you all of these cysts
statistics right on your computer this
would be at I netqin com I will provide
the link in the description so there's
no hassle around I'd like to get right
into the ante los feature so once you
register your account you'll be able to
login I go right to the ante los feature
now your old phone number will appear
here and you can look at your history
here and one of the cool things is you
can find your location to phone do a
sound alarm in case you know if you
can't find it do a remote lock or remote
delete this is really cool so if we were
just look at the map now we can change
what the map looks like you can also go
to contacts and contacts us basically if
you would have set this up i don't have
the synced yet but if you would have
this synced you would have all the
statistics of of most of the context so
the context is mostly on the device
but the thing I'm talking about is the
security this is what you have to set up
and then we'll show the statistics right
on this page getting into calendar is
relatively the same exact thing can
import google and outlook calendars
ain't going back home will show that you
have no backups recently security levels
unknown and showing you that your
devices right give you a little calendar
location I guess it's really cool I love
this app for for being free it's a great
app and I probably future Lee upgrade to
pro because it seems like there's a lot
of features and pro that would be worth
it upgraded anti-lost features would be
great and I'd probably get that so this
is NQ space and we're just going to sum
up this app so if I were to give this a
rating probably around for 4.5 out of 5
some of the reasons is it's got a few
minor glitches the first couple times I
really couldn't find my phone and it
gets date on it but I ended up getting
it anyway not sure just a glitch but yes
is a great great app you can download
from the market you can also get the pro
version which will get you more features
such as Angie lost features like I don't
know more easy to it's just like oh yeah
one of the other things that I
complained about is when I try to find
location it would take a long time so
that should be fixed as college their
servers though but yeah this is um neck
shin and my name is will from Angela
sorry this has been the national
security app review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
