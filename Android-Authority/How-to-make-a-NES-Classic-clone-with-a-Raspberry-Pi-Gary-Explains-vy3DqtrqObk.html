authority if you're like me you remember
the Nintendo Entertainment System if
you're like me you also really really
pleased when Nintendo released the
Nintendo classic edition with those 30
games that were from the Nintendo
Entertainment System and if you're like
me you were really disappointed you
couldn't get hold of one no matter what
website you went to no matter how we
tried they just weren't the sell
material prepared to pay some really
stupid prices for them and if you're
like me you were really sad when I for
only just six months
apparently I sold two million units
Nintendo decide to stop selling the nest
classic edition and if you're like me
you're wondering well can I make a nest
classic edition clone maybe with a
Raspberry Pi well if you are like me let
me explain how you can do it now before
we get started I would just like to say
that neither I nor and rathore 'ti
condone piracy of games in any way
whatsoever now I'd like to read some
stuff from the Nintendo website that
addresses this very issue again the nest
classic edition was a brilliant piece of
software and hardware combination
basically it was an ARM processor
running on a small ball that they put in
a box they copied the games onto it and
they use their own emulator to emulate
the the original Nintendo Entertainment
System now because it was based on an
ARM processor actually that shows the
performance is good enough that if we
had an ARM processor on maybe something
like a Raspberry Pi and we got hold of
an emulator maybe something like
emulation station then maybe we could
also create a Nintendo classic edition
and if you really want to make your
experience or think that you can get
hold of yourself a small Raspberry Pi
case that comes with a little flap there
I've got this one off eBay we hero the
USB ports around the site oh got space
for the different power adapter than
HDMI adapter and that even looks like a
little nest system I also got hold of a
generic USB game controller that kind of
nest like there
different models available this was just
one of the cheapest one so that was also
good to buy so making this up to my
little case up to my Raspberry Pi seeing
the site look quite good now there are
several different ways you can do this
now what I'm going to go through mainly
in this video is a spatial distribution
for the Raspberry Pi called the retropie
and that basically just turns your
Raspberry Pi into a dedicated emulator
not only for Nintendo but also for a
whole range of different vintage and
classic gaming systems now the first
step is to go over to the retropie
website you'll find links again over in
the article and you need to download the
image and then you need to use a tool
like HR to write the image onto the SD
card you can do that from a Mac or a PC
Windows PC or from Linux that all the
links you need are over in the article
and once you've copied that over onto
the Raspberry Pi you need to plug it
into your ugly PI and basically just
boot it up okay so I've got my Raspberry
Pi inside this Nintendo case I've got
the controller connected up I've got
catch up to my TV the SD card with
retropie copied onto it is in there so
let's just power it up see what happens
so some booting going on now and here's
the retro PI symbol on the screen
okay so we'll press a gay button here on
the game controller okay and when you go
with up-down left-right start select a B
X Y
right now if you haven't got a key on
your controllers ask you for you just
long press and it will just skip longer
than any key so we long press all of
these okay
and then we get up to the retropie
distribution running an emulator isn't
at the moment there's nothing you can do
other than to go into the configuration
but here I have my USB drive with the
games copied onto it now the way you
copy the games onto it is simple you
take the USB fat32 you stick it into a
laptop or into a PC double its Mac Linux
or Windows you create on that a retropie
folder and inside the retropie folder
you create a roms folder inside the roms
folder you create a nests NES folder and
you copy your games into that folder and
then what you do is you plug those that
USB Drive into your Raspberry Pi and
then on here we go to restart emulation
station if we want to restart it and
then we restart it we'll find the games
and there we go now it's come up with
Nintendo and it says there are seven
games available let's go into there and
now we can start playing games and
notice here I'm only using the game
controller I don't need to use a
keyboard or any other kind of turn the
volume up here right now let's see how
bad I really am at Donkey Kong there we
go now to get out of a game and go back
into the emulator you press both the
Select and start at the same time and
then that takes me down here where I can
now play my other games and that's it
and so there you have it how to make
your own Nintendo Entertainment System
classic edition using a 3d printed case
and a Raspberry Pi and some software you
can download from the internet man's
garrison for Landreth hora T and I hope
you enjoyed this video if you did please
do give it a thumbs up also please don't
forget to subscribe to and royalties
youtube channel hit that Bell
notifications who get told every time we
upload a new video and last but not
least do over to Andrew authority calm
