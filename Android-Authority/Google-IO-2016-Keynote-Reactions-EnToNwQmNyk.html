usual introduction if we all say I don't
know it just feels weird if we're all
gonna say like from android authority
okay okay three times in a row hey it's
Josh Bazar from Android 30 what's going
on everybody and I'm joined by lon when
I'm as I'm sure all of you know and some
of you may know Chris Carlin one of our
writers and also has been on a couple of
videos on the YouTube channel so we're
talking google i/o it's officially the
first day and it's at the shoreline
amphitheater as you can see we're
outside for the first time at a google
i/o uh how's it feel so far girls it's
been good it's very laid back for sure
any outdoor situation is pretty nice
sun's out snorts a hug it's good it's
not too hot it's hot are you talking
about I'm freaking sweating over here
just notice how does yet these canteens
full of water yeah all right well we're
gonna go ahead and get right to it it's
the i/o keynote reaction now there were
a lot of rhea we're reacting but there
were a lot of announcements rather
during the keynote and we're going to go
down the line a little bit by the way
just so you guys know stay tuned to the
android authority channel stay tuned
right here for footage of all the cool
stuff all the stuff behind us that you
may or may not be able to see because
the shoreline amphitheater was converted
into a big playground for all of the
people attending i oh so all of that
will be coming in the next couple of
days and yeah but for now we're just
going to talk about the keynote so
thoughts on the Kino you guys well I
mean there was a lot of there was a lot
of announcements for sure they came
pretty thick and fast but in terms of
the big sort of ground shaking game
changes they didn't really seem to be so
many this year not as many as in
previous years I mean there were some
big stuff you know Android VR daydream
via google home these are pretty big but
they're not something they didn't seem
very far out of left field other things
we pretty much expected and in many ways
new were coming yeah I think there were
some like Krista there's some
interesting products but a lot of it we
sort of expected like you said earlier
when we were talking as a lot of a lot
of it's very reactionary and I sort of
do you agree with that but then we also
had a lot of very a lot of polishing to
android so nothing really too surprising
because we saw a lot of it in the Alpha
releases but still good to see them show
it off and sort of go a little bit more
in depth with what we saw with the
releases so far so so with that why
don't we just going to go down the line
that I started off with a couple of new
apps you made specifically for
communication aloe and do it well I say
a low is it a low as an aloe vera aloe
vera yeah LOL a ll ALL oh yeah sorry
British name actually a little oh
there's one for now Ralph maybe so the
the whole idea that there's a little bit
more functionality in terms of how you
can communicate with people it also ties
into the brand new not brand new but the
Google assistant rather which is
basically going to be a contextual
backend for pretty much everything that
you're doing on on Android but how did
you guys feel about aloe and duo duo
being the video messaging service that's
why don't know whether to apps for stars
I mean why not bake them into one app
because like you were saying I mean
they're not going to be default apps on
on anything unless maybe nexuses but I
mean not splitting them already into two
already makes it harder I know you don't
really think they need to exist at all
it's not that yeah I I like the
functionality that aloe and duo bring
like a lowes really cool with the way
that you can shout or whisper text
messages and you can draw on photos and
the integration with Google being able
to ask Google now basically questions
within within the app itself and all the
other different things you can do with
it it's all really nice features but it
kind of makes you question why did they
have to bring a whole new entire
messaging app in order to do all this
why couldn't they just you know revamp
hangouts and incorporate incorporate it
all into hangouts because it just makes
a little bit more convoluted now when
you have you know hangouts and messenger
and now you have a low well yeah that's
essentially where I'm coming from there
too it's because i use a google voice
number and i absolutely love using it
because i use multiple devices so if a
low is going to come in and be tied to
the number you put onto their what will
happen to google voice well it's still
have the same functionality and whatnot
because
having a low and do it kind of means
that we have redundancies across Android
there's so many applications duo even
though it looks like a great video
messaging application yeah it's
basically what you do when you'd swipe
left on the snapchat it's essentially
the same functionality it's just a few
refinements inside and then a low is
just it's just trying to make things a
little more fun but what a load does on
top of messaging is basically based on
the Google assistant so I guess for me
I'd be more excited to get google
assistant yeah because that is a lot of
fun to use yeah I mean Google assistant
is really just Google now like an in
that version of Google now from what I
understand it's not about Google home a
little bit IOT coming to the home I
guess that's why the play things
generally essentially an Amazon echo
response right yeah it's a it's
definitely they made it pretty clear
that it's going to be an Amazon echo
competitor I'm they even sort of
mentioned the echo not necessarily
talking bad about it but just saying
that's a great product and they want to
have something that sort of competes
with that and that's what google home is
going to do did you like it Chris I did
yeah I thought it was pretty well done i
mean i'm not familiar with echo so much
i haven't used it but i think it feels
long overdue is sort of surprising to me
that google hasn't done this hardware
hub for connected devices and you know
google presence in the home already I
mean I've never seen steps in this
direction before but it sort of feels
like it's a long time over dude so I'll
time Google started connecting all of
the dots in one central place and that's
exactly what Google home is all right
android wear two point oh about time
about time well we're going to go into
it i suppose more in-depth on what will
potentially be our podcast earlier this
week but kind of in a nutshell too low
too late do you think yeah it's hard to
say I mean we were discussing earlier
standalone apps I mean standalone
functionality is obviously a big deal
it's a pretty big step for the platform
but for me personally I don't really I
didn't go anywhere without my phone so
other than the odd occasion I go for a
run and don't take my phone I don't
really see it being that significant an
update for me at least with my and
Andrew
I'm good I'm good I'm going to figure
that because neither of you even wear
Android wear watches that you'll
probably this it's one of the only real
concrete announces that we really got oh
yeah it's for for me like I sort of gave
up on Android wear and just wearables in
general like a few months ago just
because I don't I felt like it was more
of a distraction than something that
made my life easier in terms of reading
notifications and things like that but I
do like some of the changes especially
the actual keyboard the on-screen
keyboard because one thing that I've
always sort of wanted was a SmartWatch
was to have an on-screen keyboard and
now they finally brought that feature so
I don't know maybe it'll bring me back
in Android wear so Google's finally
putting out their own VR platform or
rather we were discussing it earlier
we're not too sure if this is supposed
to be a particular product or platform
or an API so well yeah I mean the whole
reference design thing it sounds like
Nexus VR so I'm still a little unsure
what the ultimate game plan for that is
is it just is it like Android one or
something like I know they mentioned a
smartphone spec for daydream VR ready
devices and there'll be a whole bunch of
those out in the fall but as Google
going to be pushing its own hardware
platform like Nexus or is it just
something it's trying to encourage other
OEMs to take on with their with their be
ours so I guess we're not going to be
calling android and new a whole lot
after this keynote because not really a
whole lot of new stuff being told about
Android any no no really well i mean i
think google i don't want to say shut
itself in the foot because i totally
recognizes the importance of getting
getting a preview out early to get as
much feedback as possible before the
final release and i think that's great
but it really lets the wind out of out
of android sales that at i/o for like
big announcements it's like last year
Android Android M was like a really big
deal everyone is sitting in the hallways
flashing and getting excited and was
really cool really cool and fun but this
year just barely ready to mention and
everyone sort of knew what was coming
anyway and I mean dark mode is gone
again apparently something that we've
discovered after the fact they are
setting up for a lot of stuff in the
background well maybe not them in
particular but right behind the camera
is the amphitheater stage itself and
there's actually going to be a great
concert tonight with a couple of
headliners like big headliners you have
Charli XCX and Kai go of all people so
you know kudos to google for making
another great show you know just have
some fun afterwards and that's what
we're gearing up for hours well so this
was our rundown of the Google keynote
the i/o keynote for 2016 yeah stay tuned
to Andrew 30 for all of the great
coverage that we're going to have here
we are going to try our best to get some
demos of at least a few things around
even though the weren't really device
centric announcements at the keynote but
you know we are still excited about what
we hear you know we want to try them out
but the problem is we can't until at
least the summer at the earliest the
summer for some of this stuff yeah I
think that should pretty much do it so
thank you guys so much for watching and
stay tuned because we are your source
for all things google i/o 2016
