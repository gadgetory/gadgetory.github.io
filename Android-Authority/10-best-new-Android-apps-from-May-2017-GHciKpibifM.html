johanna the android authority app guy
and it's nearing the end of May which
means it's time to round up the best new
Android apps that were released over the
last month if you want to check out any
of these apps for yourself you can find
those links in the video description
below
Amazon free time is a new kids app it
boasts a collection of video content
from big kids companies like PBS
Nickelodeon Disney and others there is
also a variety of books games and other
content that's well suited for children
you can use the applications dashboard
to list the age of your kid and that way
they can get content geared specifically
for their age range the subscription
prices are a little complicated however
this is one of the few services that
Amazon offers to people without an
Amazon Prime subscription don't get us
wrong though it is cheaper if you do
already have one AMOLED minimal
wallpapers is an application that
describes itself it's a wallpapers app
with a host of minimal wallpapers and
they are designed specifically for
AMOLED screens that means there is a
whole bunch of black the base
application has a ton of fun minimal
wallpapers and there are also donate
versions that you can buy if you want
wallpapers specifically designed for the
s8 or RS 8 plus or super-high resolution
the free application should work in most
cases though you can also get the
application even if you don't have an
AMOLED screen if you just enjoy the
style Astro is a new email client that
also has a chat bot the chat bot will
notify you about things ask you if you
want to unsubscribe for email lists and
a whole lot more on top of that the
application boasts a snooze mode click
inbox organization personal reminders
and more as dealing with a few early
issues however when it works it works
rather well to be honest this one still
needs some work from the developers so
it's best to file it away under apps to
keep an eye on Auto sent is a nifty
automation app it works by automatically
turning functions on your phone on or
off when certain apps are opening for
instance you can have the phone turn
Wi-Fi on when you open Netflix it works
well most of the time however some
things like GPS and mobile data might
require an ADB command to be run on your
PC to make it work right it's definitely
a power user application more than
anything it costs a dollar 49 and it has
no in-app purchase
is Panna recipes wants to be the Netflix
of cooking apps it features over 400
video recipes made by over 45 talented
chefs and you can search based on your
dietary interests annotate written
recipes with your own ideas and add
items to the shopping list that's built
in you can try it free for 30 days but
it does require a subscription after
that it's not ideal but at least you can
try it before deciding if paying for it
is right for you
Socratic is an educational app more
specifically it's an application that
teaches you how to map it works by using
your camera to capture an equation the
application then pops up several pages
of information on how to solve the
problem generally the first page walks
you through solving the problem while
subsequent pages shows you the
information and math rules that you'll
need to solve it it's a great
application for students especially the
ones who have problems with math it's
totally free at least for right now spot
angels is an application that remembers
where you parked it also gives you
information on the parking rules in the
general area the central premise of the
app is to help people avoid making
mistakes that result in potentially
expensive traffic tickets it supports
over 20 cities but it's still useful
even if you don't live in one of them
the application secondary premise is to
remember where you parked your car and
that works virtually everywhere
you can also crowdsource additional
information by adding pictures and rules
that the app might not already have
stash for reddit is an unreleased
application in the Google Play Store
the idea is to download a variety of
posts from reddit in the background so
that they can be read offline later the
current iteration downloads 100 posts
and that includes images gifs and videos
future releases will include account
support subreddit selection for download
a time schedule bandwidth limit options
and a whole lot more it's not all that
great just yet however you should
definitely file this one under apps to
keep an eye on task Z is like a light
version of IFTTT it allows you to
program automatic actions based on the
things happening on your device it gives
you a decent if small selection of
commands to give for instance you can
have it open a specific music app when
you plug in your headphones and then you
can have it open a different music app
if you plug in your headphones while
you're also in the car it's not the most
powerful automation app ever made
however it's far more simple than most
of the other options it's also totally
free we do is a task management
application that focuses a little more
on
groups you create groups in the
application invite people into those
groups and then people can create tasks
that everyone can see it's great for
small businesses families and stuff like
that you can also use it alone if you
insist
it features reminders subtasks and you
can create tasks that repeat like taking
out the garbage every week it's still in
beta in the Google Play Store and those
that try it should be prepared to find
bugs otherwise it's free and it works
pretty well and that about does it for
this one folks don't forget to subscribe
to android authority and bring the bell
to get the latest android authority
videos as soon as they're released and
again all of these applications are
linked in the video description below if
you want to check any of them out as
always thanks for watching everybody and
have a wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
