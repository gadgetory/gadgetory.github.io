one-handed operators why cuz I don't
want to live my life like this I want to
live my life like this and then have my
other hand free to do other stuff hold a
drink
walk a dog use a remote drive car no I
don't do that well I do that you do that
too we should both stop so just shut up
and admit the fact that one hand
operation matters and because of that I
have a lot of anticipation for the
smaller of Google's two pixels
smartphones it sports a 5-inch screen
with Full HD resolution it's a high-end
device that's powered by a Snapdragon
820 one chipset and has four gigabytes
of RAM easily this is the most powerful
of all the small Android phones on this
list making it a great option for power
users that don't want a massive display
for whatever reason aside from the
high-end specs and one of the best
cameras that you can get in a smartphone
the Google pixel also offers a stock
Android experience a lot of users simply
love I know I do however the design of
the device hasn't been all that well
received just because it's kind of
generic the pixel also definitely isn't
the most affordable of the small Android
phones you can get your hands on as it
retails for $649 for the 32 gigabyte
version and $749 for the hundred and
twenty-eight gigabyte option and yes I
know there are new pixels coming out
very very soon and it's very likely that
the smaller of those two new pixels
would be on this list to watch out for
that but let's talk about a lesser-known
option and that's the samsung galaxy a3
from 2017 it is a compact mid-range
device thanks to its 4.7 HD display it
was announced in January and sports a
metal frame with a 3d glass back and is
water and dust resistant thanks to the
ip68 rating in case you're wondering
this means that it can be submerged and
up to one and a half meters of water for
around thirty minutes you'll find the
Exynos 7870 chipset under the hood along
with two gigabytes of RAM the smartphone
runs Android 6.0 point one marshmallow
with Samsung's custom skin on top other
things worth mentioning are the 13
megapixel
the twenty three hundred and fifty
million power battery and a fingerprint
scanner located on the front below the
screen in terms of design it looks very
similar to a lot of other Galaxy
smartphones which can either be a good
or bad thing depending on who you ask it
retails for around $280 US and comes in
quite a few different colors while not
the very best of these small Android
phones on the market if you're a Samsung
fan this is looking pretty good and of
course we've got to talk about Sony's
Xperia xz1 compact this is the most
compact of the small Android phones on
this list as it features the smallest
screen measuring at four point six
inches
the Xperia X z1 compact is the successor
to the earlier xperia x compact and it
also happens to be one of the first
phones that will launch with android 8.0
Oreo pre-installed even though it is
small it is powerful it sports the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor it
also has four gigabytes of RAM 32
gigabytes of on-board storage a twenty
seven hundred million power battery in
addition it has ip68 dust and water
resistance and a 19 megapixel rear
camera with Sony's new motion eye
technology which is supposed to capture
photos a couple of seconds before the
user actually takes the photo for better
visuals the phone has an eight megapixel
front facing camera which can switch
between a 22 millimeter focal length and
a 90 degree field of view for tight
selfie pictures and a twelve point five
millimeter focal length and a hundred
and twenty degree field of view for
group selfies like all Sony phones in
the US it will not have a fingerprint
sensor although other parts of the world
will now as of today Amazon is selling
this device unlocked for $5.99 now let's
talk about a device many of you know
even less about and that's the Nokia 3hm
D global relaunched the Nokia brand for
smartphones earlier this year with
several different models at the moment
the smallest of these devices is the
Nokia 3 with a 5-inch 720 display inside
there's a mediatek mt6752 bytes of
internal storage and an 8 megapixel
camera on the front and
back it also comes with a twenty six
hundred and thirty million power battery
and it runs Android 7.0 new game but an
update to Android eight o Oreo is
planned to be released before the end of
2017 and the good news is that you can
get the Nokia three for as little as one
hundred and eighty three dollars
unlocked from Amazon in its black color
but the price goes up to 187 for silver
white versions and 219 for the all-white
Edition it's a worthy addition to the
best small Android phone list
next up the sony xperia x a the xperia x
sports a 5-inch display with small
bezels on the left and right sides that
really look nice and make the device
look more compact although its specs
won't blow your socks off exactly the
xperia x se is still a great device it's
powered by the mediatek mt6752 set has
two gigabytes of RAM and is equipped
with a 13 megapixel primary camera as
well as a dedicated camera button on the
right side it runs Android marshmallow
with Sony's custom skin on top and packs
a 2300 million power battery that
supports fast charging unfortunately it
doesn't have a fingerprint sensor on
board now the Xperia x8 was released in
the u.s. back in July 2016 and retailed
for around 280 the device which comes in
graphic black white lime gold and rose
gold can now be yours for as little as a
hundred and sixty eight dollars on
Amazon now I have a lot of first-hand
experience with the next best bang for
your buck option and that's the Moto G 5
the Moto G 5 is a mid-range er that was
announced at the Mobile World Congress
2017 it features a 5 inch full HD
display is powered by the Snapdragon 430
chipset and comes with either 2 or 3
gigabytes of RAM unlike its predecessor
it features a metal body that makes it
look as well as feel premium you'll find
a fingerprint scanner on the front of
the device that supports various
gestures you can for example swipe left
to go back or swipe right to open recent
apps the Moto G 5 also sports a
removable battery with a capacity of
2800 million powers a 13 megapixel
camera but doesn't have NFC it comes in
fine gold lunar grey south
I blew in some regions now we've had
multiple Moto G's here in our family and
they've been fantastic they're great mid
tier best bang for your buck options
they're more than enough for the average
Android user my wife currently has this
phone and she likes it no complaints
whatsoever and you can get it for $250
you asked right now here in Canada
unfortunately it's not selling in the US
at this time but if you can get it
sweet deal well as someone who runs an
online business I can tell you that I
look for tools that make my life easier
