tries to stack the deck against the
competition and the other tries to
rethink the game all together this is
Joshua Vergara manager Authority what's
going on everybody and this is the LG g4
vs. the Samsung Galaxy s6 edge while one
of these phones went in a pretty
different direction from before the
other tries to bring some new tricks to
the formula yes the Samsung Galaxy s6
edge in this case is no longer of a
plastic construction which is big for a
lot of users who weren't really happy
with that plastic anymore and with that
comes the omission of irremovable
backing however a metal frame keeps
together a dual glass profile but the
unibody design keeps the battery fixed
and expandable storage has been kept
from this new galaxy as well but while
the regular galaxy s6 retains the pebble
design from previous devices Samsung
went all-in with the curved display and
put edges on both sides of this
particular panel this turns out to be a
great feature for handling in particular
as the screen comes down to meet the
palm and makes this one accessible
device a prominent metal lip definitely
helps here so that the screen isn't all
you're touching on the sides but
otherwise this is a very Samsung S phone
with the classic button layout tactile
home button flanked by backhand recent
apps capacitive keys and then the power
button and the volume rocker or on the
sides
LG's general design is very similar to
releases of the past year with the g4
coming with a larger screen but keeping
a few points for handling mainly the
button layout on the back that falls
squarely where the index finger would
land this is LG's signature now and
remains a nicely functional take on the
typical button placement curves are also
a part of the LG g4 but to a lesser
extent the curve on the front is subtle
and much more pronounced on the back but
in either case it helps with the phone
sitting in the palm as well as for
durability compared to normal slab
smartphones and of course the main
addition to the g4 is the leather
backing plenty of nice feeling leather
colors are available but the heavily
finished plastic finishes are available
if you have a problem with cow sourced
material what's most important however
is that the backings are all removable
meaning that the large battery found
within can be replaced with spares and a
slot for micro SD cards is also
available both phones leverage the
curved display to a certain extent with
the Galaxy S
edge focusing on features and the g4
prioritizing durability but it speaks to
how unique both of these phones really
try to be handling is obviously a
feather in the cap of the s6 edge but
that can be mostly due to its smaller
size meanwhile the g4 gets style points
for its leather backings but otherwise
this is best described as a worthwhile
update to previous editions of LG's
flagship line each company brings their
respective display pedigrees to these
phones with very specific focuses indeed
the Super AMOLED panel from Samsung is
an enhanced version of what you may come
to expect already quad HD resolution
despite this 5-inch display with all of
the high color saturation Samsung has
pushed for a long time now very high
pixel densities are found here so all
elements are really sharp whether at
work or at play but what sets the edge
apart is its usage of either curve you
can put panels there particulate like
information streaming make it glow a
certain color if your favorite people
are calling you and set it as a
persistently glowing night clock these
features might not be very robust or
even completely useful for the masses
but the story remains that the Super
AMOLED from either Galaxy S iteration of
the s6 continued Samsung's history of
great display quality and in the g4 an
update to one of the first quad HD
releases flies right in the face of the
Super AMOLED philosophy and in the LG g4
an update to one of the first quad HD
releases flies right in the face of the
Super AMOLED philosophy LG's focus this
time around was to adhere to a DCI stand
or typically found in TV and cinema
supposedly hitting 98% of that mark
rather than going far over it as Samsung
routinely does apparently this is
achieved by enhancing the IPS panel into
what is called a quantum display so LG's
typical panel gets a boost in color
gamut and saturation 5.5 inches already
is great for media consumption and even
text for those who need a bit of a boost
for the eyes as the pixel density is
still quite high those claims about
color saturation might be a bit too
specific for the common user but it's
hard not to see that the quantum display
is definitely a few steps back in how it
interprets colors compared to the Super
AMOLED it comes down to whether or not
sensory overload is important to you for
lack of a better term because we found
that the Super AMOLED display tends to
please just that little bit more than
other displays that said the g4 display
brings more real estate for more fun
so that certainly makes up for that
ground lost in the color Department if
you do prefer higher saturation I still
give the Galaxy s6 edge points for
handling but the 5.5 inch display does
definitely still enhance work in play
and again both of these releases go in
different directions for the performance
aspect we start with Samsung who decided
not to rely on the snapdragons of the
world and viewed the galaxy s6 as the
global coming-out party for the Exynos
7420 3 gigabytes of ram rounds out the
multitasking departments but what is
most important here is how Samsung did
truly optimize this new version of
TouchWiz with their in-house processing
package indeed the Samsung UI flies
through its elements with one of the
best ways of seeing it being the camera
launch shortcut via a double press of
the home button multitasking doesn't
take a hit even when using the multi
window or the S window capabilities but
the recent apps screen is just as fast
as it should be in this current crop of
Android smartphones LG instead
strengthened their relationship with
Qualcomm and stuck with their Snapdragon
808 and high optimization to bring a
fast version of the LG UX back to by the
adrenal 4:18 and also three gigabytes of
RAM this might not sound like the
highest-performing package available but
it certainly feels like one the UX is
still pretty saturated with features but
optimizations seem to have worked well
to make this a very reliable and snappy
daily worker the same situations for
multitasking go quite smoothly then LG's
own shortcut for launching the camera is
pretty fast as well when it works
most of the time while I did notice a
bit of stutter in the g4 when playing
dragon quest 8 in particular this can be
due in part to the larger screen as much
as the somewhat dialed back processing
package performance for the most part is
not a problem in either of these devices
and you'd be hard-pressed to call one
that much faster than the other
disparity in situations like gaming are
still pretty narrow and if you had to
blame the software the LG UX still does
feel a little more bloated compared to
the somehow more Spartan iteration of
touch ways this time around for perhaps
the first time the hardware situation
between the two korean giants has some
real separation and that's because the
LG g4 decided to keep two key features
that many people have been vocal about
in this new galaxy iteration expandable
storage is probably the main source spot
though the 32 gigabyte based storage
option should be enough for the tip
user but the battery is no longer
removable so those who wanted the
convenience of spares won't be able to
take that advantage but the hardware
editions while somewhat fringe do add to
the phone's appeal like the heart rate
sensor that works better this time
around because of a vertical orientation
and an easy-to-use fingerprint reader
and the home button makes security
pretty easy as you just have to press
the button and leave your finger there
to unlock the device the LG g4 does not
come with the last to mention features
but brings the removable battery and
expandable storage security is still a
personal matter as knock code returns
though it is simply it not as easy as
Samsung's fingerprint reader 32
gigabytes of storage is the norm for the
g4 and but the ability to use microSD
cards is a big boost and is important
for those who in particular want to
shoot raw in the camera and in battery
the 3000 milliamp hour unit does bring
some long battery life for even heavier
users to perform tasks all day though
the larger high-resolution display does
seem to even things out a bit getting
that second day of longevity is still a
little bit tough to achieve which might
be a little bit of a sore spot because
full current iterations of fast charging
aren't available here and wireless
charging requires a specific back cover
and in camera LG one straight
head-to-head with Samsung in many
aspects of their camera right down to
the aperture indeed LG tried to one-up
the Samsung F 1.9 aperture camera by
bringing 1.8 and a larger sensor which
does make sense for the right amount of
data capture for photos and even then
the fast laser guided autofocus is
backed up by what is called a color
spectrum sensor which tries to analyze
the scene for proper white balance
interpretation but the one-upsmanship
continues with the manual mode in which
the g4 camera app provides everything
from a histogram to a full Kelvin white
balance gamut to plenty of ISO stops and
shutter speeds all in a pretty intuitive
interface that any seasoned photographer
will feel at home in yet pretty much
anyone can get some great photos from
the fast and responsive simple mode
we're just hitting the subject will make
it focus and get the shots the
front-facing camera is another attack on
Samsung as gesture based shots are
bolstered by a 8 megapixel package
rather than the 5 megapixel powered
Samsung front-facing shooter these
pictures are quite good in either case
but we might put the s6 wide selfie
feature as a little more useful than any
of these gesture modes but it is pretty
nice we had
to easily check yourself portrait by
bringing down the phone to a viewing
angle which brings us to the samsung
camera now whose f 1.9 aperture camera
is still in a good place for nice depth
of field shots and doesn't lose that
footing from the g4 in that regard but
it's a blue cz's a little more ground
when comparing manual modes Samsung app
provides a manual control but certainly
not in terms of my new adjustments HDR
can be kept on auto at all times like in
the g4 but this is also true for the
front-facing camera that is also f 1.9
samsung did finally get it that
post-processing can make or break an
image and in looking closer at the
Samsung photos the grain is largely left
alone not to mention that these photos
get a bump up in saturation making for
some really vivid photos in almost any
situation
now while the saturation isn't quite as
high for the g4 it does do a good job of
interpreting proper white balance levels
making for a pretty accurate photo most
of the time the f-18 aperture doesn't
put it that much better in low-light
situations but we do prefer it over
Samsung in these cases but the g4 does
have a bit of post-processing and noise
reduction going on still making these
photos a little smudgy unless that tiny
bit behind yet this can be helped by
shooting in RAW format for some
post-production work in programs like
Lightroom which is a great feature for
the budding shutterbug as we already
mentioned these are two of the best
Android cameras we've used and either of
these phones will be great companions to
have in the pocket the g4 might be a bit
faster in its auto mode but the Samsung
pictures are just that little bit more
pleasing to the eyes with their punched
up colors and finally in software once
heavily bloated operating systems do get
the optimizations needed to create
speedy and reliable daily drivers but in
the case of LG much of what might have
gotten too far into the users face do
remain but are well hidden enough in
this lollipop version of the UX certain
features like the smart bulletin still
need to be turned off from the get-go
and the smart notice despite its pretty
simple look doesn't prove as useful as
LG claims and the qslide apps are tucked
away from the quick settings unless you
really need them even the enhanced
calendar application for better date and
item saving as well as a categorizing
gallery don't really add up to really
big additions but certain things like
the Mac code and the ability to
customize a soft key layout help the
experience with dual window round
the multitasking yet ultimately this is
a very LGS take on Android and it
manages to not be very harsh on the eyes
what its most important here is that
even when jumping among recent apps and
sliding menus to and fro it keeps its
speed throughout which is great and a
testament to LG's connection with
Qualcomm Samsung looked inward for their
own operating system not only optimizing
it for the Exynos but also slimming it
down for the user plenty of tutorials in
particular that use to annoy users are
largely not found multi-window is as
useful as ever which can be quite said
for the s finder and the S window
capabilities the latter of which is only
available if you so want it and it's not
shoved in your face Samsung's own apps
have been updated - including s-health
which looks better and is the platform
for the better heart rate sensor and of
course there are the edges which has a
few features like quake notification
view and takers for things like Twitter
and news feeds but ultimately its best
usage is still as a night clock where
the time is lightly shown during user
defined hours like in the evening for
your nightstand as this year's flagship
releases for both of these companies
either will come in at the premium price
on contracts and unlocks pictured here
are the costs for either phone on the
t-mobile simple choice plans the g4 of
which has just made it onto all of the
different carriers in the States and for
the money these are very robust
offerings if you want the best Android
flagships available right now both of
these phones tick off a lot of different
boxes those who want a larger device
will go for the g4 with its 5.5 inch
screen that provides the quality needed
for work and play the galaxy s6 and edge
are still fun at their smaller size but
it is at the expense of expandable
storage and a removable battery for a
more unique looking device the s6 edge
is probably the most head-turning device
but the leather backing of the g4 gives
it a real measure of style and either
camera or bring the kind of quality
users will want for capturing the moment
at any time as daily drivers these are
speedy Android phones that are less
bogged down by gimmicks than they were
in the past of course it's always going
to come down to what your needs are but
what's great about these korean giants
and their new flagship phones is that
where one doesn't succeed the other one
likely does and vice versa so you just
need to get in touch with your
requirements and then you can take your
pick so as always thank you guys very
much for watching and I hope
