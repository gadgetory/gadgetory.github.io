happy holidays everybody
if you have been watching our videos
recently you saw that we did the best
phones of 2013 while now it's time to
take a look at the best tablets of 2013
now I have donned my Christmas colors
and are next to our Christmas tree and
of course a nice cold Southern
California night is not complete without
some hot cocoa
now the reason why I Don all of this is
because it occurred to me that a tablet
would look pretty damn good at the
bottom of a Christmas tree and I'm
certain that with the ones we have in
mind it would certainly cause a lot of
excitement for whoever you are going to
buy this tablet for now since the tablet
space is quite a lot smaller than the
phone space we're going to actually do a
top 3 list and we're cutting it up into
two categories large tablets and small
tablets essentially large tablets are
10-inch behemoths and smaller tablets
are more in the 7 or 8 inch range one
thing I do want to mention before I get
started however is that we have left the
fourth versions of Android tablets aside
in this particular best of list the
reason why is because while there are
some great offerings in say the Kindle
Fire HDX or even a couple of nooks out
there if they do not use Google services
we have decided to leave them out of the
list don't get us wrong however there
are some good offerings out there so you
can check them out as well as I have
reviewed a couple of them coming in in
third place in the small tablets
category is the Asus memo pad 7 HD now
the budget end of the Android tablet
space is very competitive and there are
a lot of cheap tablets out there but the
Asus memo pad 7 HD definitely heads the
pack clinching our 3rd spot in the small
category one of the most affordable
Android devices ever the memo pad 7 HD
comes in at the launch price of one
hundred and fifty dollars and it comes
with the reliable 1.2 gigahertz
quad-core cortex a7 that powers are very
good-looking 1280 by 800 resolution
display overall the performance in this
tablet while not necessarily up to the
high-end standards will definitely still
get the job done
and overall the memo pad will provide
perhaps the easiest entry point into the
Android tablet space and it is not too
good to be true
if you have some extra money why not
upgrade to LG's return tablets the LG G
pad which clinches the second spot in
our small category $350 is the price tag
here and it is more along norm of the
tablet prices but it does come with
matching specs an 8 point 3 inch display
is actually pretty easy to hold in just
one hand and gets just below the point
of discomfort and it also brings great
LG's screen quality at 1920 by 1200
resolution so all media looks wonderful
no matter what you're looking at on this
wonderful display a Snapdragon 600
processor keeps the Optimus cui very
snappy and a 4600 milliamp hour battery
unit keeps everything long-lasting and
of course expandable storage is always a
plus over the 16 gigabytes that is
already included perhaps the main
pleasing factor about this LG G pad is
its solid build quality if there is a
mix of plastic here but an aluminium
slab on the back really adds to the
style and also really gives it more
sturdiness and a better feel in the hand
so it might have been a little while for
LG in terms of the tablet space but
their return tablet really is a thing of
beauty
well it should probably come as no
surprise that the Nexus 7 gets the top
spot in the small tablet category
because after all it fully represents
the best of Android as a
middle-of-the-road device in terms of
its price the $229 7-inch offering by
asus and google provides a lot of value
and understated but very solid design
affords the Nexus 7 a soft touch backing
that feels really nice and is really
stylish it is actually one of the
best-looking devices one of our
favorites of the entire year a 1920 by
1200 resolution screen shines right
through back to by a still good
performing Snapdragon s4 pro and stereo
speakers make this an even better value
because of its audio performance and as
Nexus devices often benefit from this
following aspect stock Android is really
the icing on top of the cake and
provides the real quintessential
experience ultimately the Nexus 7 takes
the crown for providing a wonderful
experience at a price that is just right
and now we move on into the large tablet
space now in this category we're looking
at tablets that have 10 inch screens
typically actually all three of the
tablets in this category are 10-inch
behemoths and they all provide great
resolution and a wonderful media
consumption experience so with all of
the different choices that we have had
this year a few in particular really
caught our eye
in at third place is the Samsung Galaxy
Note 10.1 2014 edition now Samsung took
quite a few forward steps with the
Galaxy Note 3 and we absolutely loved
how they also appeared in the tablet
offering a textured plastic backing
mimics leather and gives this tablet an
executive look and feel especially when
you look at the black version the new
s-pen functions are also available here
further enhanced by a monstrous 10 inch
display at 2560 by 1600 resolution
indeed the s-pen benefits greatly from
this much larger canvas as do all of the
multitasking functions really having a
10 inch display with a stylus as
versatile as the s-pen is just a joy it
is powered by either the Snapdragon 800
or the exitos 50 420 octa so performance
is really no question when it comes to
the Note 10.1 however the other story
was three gigabytes of RAM that was
included for all of the new s-pen
functions and for further multitasking
all in all this is just a beast however
it comes with a beastly price and it is
the main reason why this one is a little
bit harder to recommend than the other
two in this list 599 dollars at the base
price is just a hard pill to swallow
making the Note 10.1 a little tough to
recommend right away even though we
would definitely recommend it for anyone
who can afford that price in our second
place for the large tablet category is
the Sony Xperia tablet Z now in 2013
Sony really tried to put their best foot
forward out there and the Xperia tablet
Z is a wonderful example of that the
Snapdragon s4 pro is what they went with
in terms of the processing package but
for a 10-inch screen they also got 1920
by 1200 resolution in there now both of
these choices do still hold up and
provide great experiences but
you can consider them to be somewhat
outdated aside from that however what
really makes the tablet stand out is its
build and its style very rigid sides and
an incredibly thin profile make this
tablet quite the looker perhaps maybe
the best one in the bunch and since it
is very thin this is a true black slate
device now IP certification is yet
another trump card for the tablet Z as
the Xperia tablet Z can take a spill or
a splash and that all helps keep the
beauty absolutely safe we give the
Xperia tablet Z a lot of credit for
probably being one of the best looking
devices of the year and because of its
form factor it really exudes that tablet
motif better than probably any other
ones out there now I know I know the
Nexus 10 came out in 2012 so why is it
at the top of the list for tablets of
2013 well simply it is because no other
tablet in 2013 could match its bang for
buck value its bargain and its ability
to be a very accessible device because
of all of that because of those reasons
the Nexus 10 will likely stay atop the
mountain especially after its refresh
we're expecting a lot from the updated
Nexus 10 however the one that we have
right now still holds up against the
competition which gives it a lot of
credit its main innovation was having an
early 2560 by 1600 display with
wonderful clarity and quality proving
that tablets and media consumption go
together beautifully and with its stock
Android build it provided that
quintessential experience that many of
us Android peers really go for now
although most of the other hardware
might be aging its processor still gets
the job done well and the dual
front-facing speakers get a very
honorable mention they perform very well
and make this quite the media
consumption tablet quite simply no large
tablet in 2013 was able to match the
Nexus 10 in the sheer banker bug that it
achieved when users constantly still ask
us to compare the latest 10-inch tablets
to the older Nexus 10 well that's a
clear sign that it should still be in
the running and for us the Nexus 10 is
still really hard to beat
and so there you have it for the best
tablets of 2013 if you're looking to buy
that special someone in your life an
Android tablet then you have to look no
further than the ones that we have
listed here not only did we cover
tablets for the budget-minded but we
also covered even the huge behemoths
that do come with high price points but
come with matching experiences so in the
end this Christmas maybe you'll be able
to give the gift of Android as always
