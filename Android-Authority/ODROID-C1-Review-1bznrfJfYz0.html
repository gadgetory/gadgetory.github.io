going strong and with the recent release
of the Raspberry Pi 2 it doesn't look at
it's going to be losing any of its
momentum now the key thing about the
Raspberry Pi 2 of course was its price
it's $35 and there are many many other
SBC's out there but none of them have
really hit that price point though to be
fair some of them do offer more
functionality that's with the exception
of hard colonel hard colonel has a
variety of different species for salem
one of them the Odroid c1 also cost just
$35 it comes with a quad-core cortex a5
CPU a Mali 450 GPU and one gig of memory
well I've got hold of one so let's have
a look at it so take a look at the
Odroid c1 board as you can see it's
small and compact like other single
board computers are available on the
market here in the middle we have the
quad-core processor which is clocked at
1.5 gigahertz there's one gigabytes of
RAM here at the back we have the 40 GPIO
pins here are 4 USB ports Gigabit
Ethernet port micro HDMI micro USB
here's the power connector a serial
connector here is the battery backup
socket for the real-time clock and here
is an infrared receiver now if we flip
the board over on the other side here we
can see that the board has its SD card
reader at the very bottom also below
that you'll see the connector for the
emmc module and emmc modules are about 2
or 3 times faster than SD card and it's
an option for the Odroid c1 now because
this card is here in the middle it does
seem that all of the weight is taken on
that reader and as you can see the board
does wobble slightly okay because it
isn't flat along the bottom now that is
a bit worrying for me but I suppose if I
bought a case that would solve all the
problems now just talking about the
power connector here this is how the
board is power it's not powered through
the microUSB port it's powered through a
more conventional socket you can buy an
external power supply or the option I
went with was this external cable which
is a USB cable and then it has the right
connector at this
and for the board to here we can see
with the connector plugged in and the
USB port of the other end I would then
connect into a phone charger to get the
board running as you may guess from the
Droid part of Odroid hard kernels range
of s pcs were originally designed to run
Android this means that the Odroid c1
support for Android is excellent the
current officially supplied version of
Android is Android 4.4 KitKat like other
SBC's we support Android the device
boots up to the standard home screen
using HDMI TV or monitor use the mouse
instead of your finger and click instead
of tap you can also add a USB keyboard
the default installation comes with a
few hard kernel specific apps Odroid
utility which is used to set the screen
resolution clockworkmod Super User
because the supplied build of Android is
rooted by default a terminal emulator
cody and dice player unfortunately you
don't get Google Play or any of Google's
services however the good news is that
Google's apps can be unofficially side
loaded using instructions which you'll
find in Odroid community forums in terms
of performance the quad-core cortex a5
isn't going to win any speed
competitions when pitched against the
latest generation of quad-core
octa-core processors which we find in
today's flagship smartphones however
that doesn't mean that the processor is
anyway slow or an underperformer
especially when remember that these
boards are designed primarily as
embedded solutions quickly yet some
benchmarks the Odroid see once called
15,000 887 on an - - and merit a frame
rate of 27.2 frames per second on Epic
Citadel both these scores are for full
HD because the board can be configured
to run in several different screen
resolutions it means that the board
scores will vary depending on the set
resolution with a smaller screen
resolution the GPU has less work to do
and as a result and to to an epic
Citadel will perform better at 720p the
C one's called 17,000 682 + n - 2 and
measure framerate a 51.5 on Epic Citadel
clearly a big difference from the full
HD scores
unlike some builds of Android which I've
seen on other SBC
Android on Leo droid recognizes USB
flash drives without any problem
this means you can insert a flash disk
and then watch videos or listen to music
store on that flash drive I was able to
play videos by the pre-installed dice
player as well as via VLC
oddly the build of Kodi which comes
pre-installed wasn't able to access the
USB Drive due to a permissions error in
terms of video decoding performance I
attested to see one with my ZTE star to
review video which is rendered at Full
HD at fourteen point seven megabits a
second the c1 was able to show the video
without any problems I also tested the
Odroid c1 using YouTube and Netflix both
again which ran without any problems
overall the Android experience is
excellent especially when you consider
this is a $35 device now as you would
expect the Odroid c1 supports more than
just Android you can also run Linux on
it now hard-code will provide an
official build of ubuntu 14.04 running
the LXDE lightweight desktop and it's
been really quite impressive and great
using Linux on this small board all the
default apps are installed that you
would need including Mozilla and
chromium and GIMP and of course there
are always the online repositories if
you want to install other programs or
other packages the Odroid c1 uses a quad
core cortex a5 cpu clocked at 1.5
gigahertz the Raspberry Pi uses a quad
core cortex a7 processor but clocked
only 900 megahertz even from a megahertz
point of view you can see that the
Odroid C 1 is going to be faster than
the Raspberry Pi tune I did some testing
using open SSL and that tests just the
CPU perform was not the CPU and GPU
performance but just alone on CPU
performance the benchmark showed me that
the Odroid c1 is almost twice as fast as
the Raspberry Pi to the Kodi and media
player is installed by default and I
don't like its Android counterpart this
version had no problem accessing the
flash drives that means if you wanted to
use this board as a media player with
Cody then it might be better to do it
under Linux than under Android and there
we have it the Odroid c1 now the
question is does the Odroid c1 provide a
real alternative to
the Raspberry Pi 2 and I think it does
of course the Raspberry Pi community is
enormous there are so many videos and
tutorials and books and projects out
there you can do it's quite amazing but
the Odroid community is also growing and
hard Conal make sure all the tools are
available that you need to fully use the
board including all of the source code
also the board does have a few
advantages over the Raspberry Pi - for
example it has Gigabit Ethernet it has
the oral use of the emmc module and I
reckon it offers about two times the
performance all this at exactly the same
price as the Raspberry Pi well my name
is Garry sim friend or authority I hope
you enjoyed this video if you did please
give it a thumbs up don't forget to
leave your comments below and tell me
what you think about the Odroid c1 also
don't forget to subscribe to and royal
authority is YouTube channel and as for
me I'll see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
