handy the Android authority app guy
we're nearing the end of January of 2016
which means it's time to round up the
best applications from the last month
apps is a unique wrapper application
that shows you hidden top charts in the
Google Play Store how it works is that
it's essentially a web link that's been
turned into an application the web link
opens the actual Google Play Store to
the top apps charts the difference is is
that it'll show you a secret set of top
charts that lists only applications
without any games there to gum up the
works this is a great way to check out
the hottest apps in the Play Store
without having to wade through a ton of
games and it's entirely free automate is
a driving companion application that
aims to bring you functionality from
your phone without distracting you from
driving it contains a ton of shortcuts
to things like music navigation your
phone dialer messaging weather updates
and a lot more
you could also fork out for the premium
version and get hands-free gestures
customized wallpapers and traffic camera
alerts it's a solid car companion
application and one that could help you
stay safe luma keyboard is a new
application that puts customization
above all else the developers boasts the
keyboards ability to adapt to the
application that you're using and the
application features a resizable
keyboard night mode some themeing
support for a wide range of devices and
emojis it also supports over 60
languages including Indic languages it's
a little bear in terms of advanced
features but it is lighter and more
minimal than most other keyboards and it
seems to work rather well hello fresh is
actually a food delivery service that
you pay to bring food straight to your
door which you can then prepare yourself
however even if you aren't interested in
the service this application can be
rather useful it contains a ton of
cooking tips and tricks along with fun
simple recipes that are mostly healthy
it's all wrapped up in a beautiful
material design inspired interface it's
a good free little app and it's worth
the download after a very long wait
Kickstarter released its official
application to the Google Play Store it
features pretty much all of the features
of the website including the ability to
back projects browse projects and even
look at your activity log the
application adheres to most of the
Android design guidelines and does a
great job of never feeling cluttered
despite the ridiculous amount of
information it displays it's come
lately free and a must-have for fans of
Kickstarter mimicker alarm is the latest
app out of the Microsoft garage project
it's an alarm app that makes you play
games with it in order to shut off or
snooze the alarm you have a few options
including the ability to make faces at
the front camera speak certain phrases
and a whole lot more if you fail the
test the application will assume you've
fallen back asleep and we'll simply
resume going off it'll wake you up
that's for sure
move some is a new step counter
application that aims to help you keep
track of how many steps you take every
day without all of the bells and
whistles they could potentially get in
the way it'll show you visual
representations of what you've burned
off through walking allow you to set
goals and keep track of prior goals and
the application simply looks nice as
well it's completely free with no in-app
purchases which makes it significantly
less expensive than a dedicated piece of
hardware that does this exact same thing
password Locker is a free password
management application that allows you
to store all kinds of private
information under a secure lock and key
the app stores your data offline as
opposed to the cloud and uses 256 bit
AES encryption which should make most
security-conscious people happy you can
also set the application to
self-destruct under certain
circumstances and you can even hide it
from the app drawer if you do want to
backup to the cloud the app has Dropbox
and Google Drive support as well the
application is $4.99 but you can check
out the free demo stop swipin is a new
application that helps prevent your
friends from swiping through your
gallery to see those embarrassing or
otherwise private photos that you keep
there for some reason it's quite simple
to use you select which pictures you
want to show your friends and the
application will create a private
gallery that keeps them from swiping
through your entire camera roll it does
require device admin rights which can be
easily revoked so the application can be
an uninstalled but otherwise it's very
simple to use and it's free
this kW RT is a photo manipulation and
editing tool that can be very useful for
both hobbyists and pro photographers the
premise of the application is to correct
imperfections caused by your camera
hardware such as lens distortion
vignette correction and more however you
can use the various tools and a little
imagination to create some wicked fun
photos that you can then share with
pretty much everyone it's 99 cents and
this is a different kind of photo
editing app once again i'm joe hindi the
Android
