android authority calm reporting here
live from CES 2012
looking at a really really coveted
product here this is the Galaxy Tab 7.7
now this is an LTE variant there is no
word yet on whether they're going to be
releasing the Wi-Fi specific brain but
this is currently going to be released
on verizon in a few weeks we're told now
as respects really what makes this
device special is that it is the first
tablet with an AMOLED display it's a
1280 by 800 display it's running a 1.4
gigahertz dual-core it's really nice and
thin feels great in the hand quite
responsive obviously going to improve a
lot once ICS gets on there no release
date on that quite yet it's got a 3
megapixel camera in the rear and the
excuse me sorry i 3 megapixel autofocus
rear camera and won't tell us how many
megapixels we're looking after the front
it's just a wonderful wonderful device I
think it's going to sell like hotcakes
no word yet on pricing but it is it's
going to be a big seller like I said
it's the first traveller with an AMOLED
display which obviously consumers have
demonstrated a huge preference towards
really responsive yeah it's coming from
Korea obviously
in Las Vegas
anyway guys use the Samsung Galaxy Tab
7.7 from Verizon coming up here in a
couple of weeks Siddharth select away
