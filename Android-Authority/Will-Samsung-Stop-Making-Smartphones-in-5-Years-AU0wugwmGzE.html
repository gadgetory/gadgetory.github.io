domain.com meet ben baharon he's a
prominent research analyst with creative
strategies a research firm that
specializes in this sort of thing and
Ben recently claimed and I quote that
Samsung will be out of the smartphone
business in the next five years
let's vet that now specifically here is
Ben's argument androids new premium
price point is between three and four
hundred bucks and the new mainstream
Android smartphone price point is under
$300 no other Android OAM Samsung
included will sell in volume anything
above those prices at those prices
cutting-edge innovation will be void
meaning the gap between iPhones and
Android will grow Ben went on to also
talk about the innovators dilemma and
how it applies to Samsung as an Android
market leader the innovators dilemma it
is that as the market matures the early
innovators get disrupted by competitors
who come into their space with lower
priced products similar specs the specs
that matter and eat into the market
share of the early innovator in that
category and yes obviously the prices of
our smartphones are going down and it
will continue to go down but how far
will we ever see a 200-dollar flagship
phone that might be a bit of a stretch
but I'd say 250-300 no problem but as
far as Samsung completely leaving the
smartphone industry no and here's why
both Apple and Samsung have proven that
there will always be a sizable
population of the market that wants
truly premium products and are willing
to pay for it I'm one of those people I
like to buy the very best and I'm
willing to save up to do it and secondly
baharon mentions how the market has
changed recently but does not appreciate
history going farther back think about
1998 or even 2004 where mobile phones
the sensational TechFest they are today
no and yet Samsung along with countless
other OEMs made and continue to make
devices even back then and for all the
talk about hallway and Xiaomi and other
Chinese manufacturers taking market
share from Samsung which they are doing
Sims
ten lower their prices they can compete
on the entry and mid-level tiers but
they aren't at least not at scale they
want to hold on to that premium market
and I don't blame them for doing so now
I'm not saying that Samsung is not in
serious trouble because they are but
Samsung knows it and at least on paper
they seem to have a vision of how to
move forward
Samsung CEO said this in order to
overcome the current crisis we need an
extraordinary transition if we resist
changes then we won't survive we must
become a leader in the new era with a
new start
educated guess here but I would predict
that Samsung will continue to give us a
bevy of mid-tier options and still have
a death grip on the true premium
flagship what do you guys think let me
know in the comments below this is my
new friend Tobias I sent him a t-shirt
in Spain and I'll send you a t-shirt too
