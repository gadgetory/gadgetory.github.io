their upcoming devices under wraps that
you think they want us to leak this info
wait now we're bringing you an exclusive
look on yet another upcoming Lenovo
handset the Moto g5 at the images which
Android authority has obtained from a
trusted source familiar with lenovo's
plan shows off the Moto G 5s in grey
gold and blue color options as you can
see in the images here the front of the
device doesn't stray too far from the
design of the standard Moto G 5 and g5 +
there's still a front-facing fingerprint
sensor below the display along with a
small motor logo sandwiched between the
earpiece and the screen on the top
moving around to the back you'll notice
the g5 s also looks to have the same
ground hockey puck style camera as the
standard moto g5 lineup
below that you'll find the classic
motorola dimple near the center of the
device in addition the g5 s will feature
a full metal design as opposed to the
aluminum backplate and plastic sides
down in the g5 and the g5 Plus this
should make the upcoming moto phone feel
a bit more high-end due to the switch to
an all-metal construction you'll notice
that there are now thin antenna cutouts
on the top and bottom of the device but
that's not all according to a leaked
slide that surfaced last week we learned
that the Moto G 5s will feature a 5.2
inch 1080p display while the Moto G 5
plus not picture here will sport a 5.5
inch 1080p screen as of right now we
don't have any pricing or availability
details to share that we will share the
update as soon as we learn more now for
those of you who are keeping track here
you might think that lenovo has very
little chance to win this mid tier
android market
I mean Samsung owns the top end of the
market and many of the Chinese
manufacturers own the entry level of the
market and much of the mid tier market
when it comes to smartphones but they
have a major advantage motorola the
brand at least is well known in the US
market which buys a huge number of
expensive phone
so that is an advantage Lecco and a lot
of other Chinese manufacturers have had
a really hard time breaking into the
u.s. Lenovo may have an advantage with
Motorola what do you think let me know
on the comments below or in the
Twitterverse
