everything even on their Android phones
I also have friends who shoot the serif
because they love sans-serif better
there are also the cooky ones who prefer
font faces such as comic sans or choco
cookie and then there are the select few
who want to make their androids look
like wedding invitations hi welcome to
Android Authority I'm Marc in this video
I'm going to talk about changing fonts
on your Android phone or tablet to
change fonts on Android you can use any
of several methods some don't need root
but others do let's talk first about the
methods not requiring root some handset
makers such as Samsung and LG often
throw in extra features into their
custom versions of Android changing
system fonts is one such extra feature
on some Samsung devices such as a galaxy
s2 galaxy s3 galaxy note galaxy note 2
Galaxy Note 10.1 and galaxy camera for
example you'll be able to change your
device's fonts to one of the
pre-installed typefaces or if you want
more fonts you can fetch more from the
Google Play Store on certain LG phones
such as the Optimus G you can also find
a similar font changing function another
non route way to use custom fonts on
your Android device is to use a custom
launcher Go Launcher exs awesome at this
this launcher is one of the most popular
custom launchers for Android to use
custom fonts and go launcher e.x first
copy or TrueType fonts to the go
launcher e.x slash of fonts directory on
your device then launch go launcher e.x
tap the menu button here then go to
preferences then choose visual settings
swipe to the font tab and here you can
choose to scan your directories for font
files the scan should be able to find
the new font so that you copied to the
fonts directory let's see if it's on the
list
how yup here it is just tap on it and
presto your father is now the default
font on go launcher
sadly go launcher exas font changing
abilities is limited to selected parts
of the
interface the font changes do not apply
system-wide the eye font app is another
way to enjoy custom fonts this free and
ad free app is primarily intended for
non rooted Samsung devices but it can
also work on rooted devices whether
Samsung or not on a non rooted Samsung
phone for instance he can easily change
fonts with eye font just pick a font for
my fonts online tab download and install
it then go to settings display font
style and seven newly installed font as
default fonts the custom font is applied
instantly without rebooting things get
more interesting with the methods for
rooted devices as always be very careful
when playing with a rooted device one
small mistake could mess up the device
so be cautious and proceed at your own
risk if you want to use an app to change
fonts on your rooted device I suggest
either 5 installer or AI font both apps
are free font installer is ad supported
but you can get a license to remove the
ads in font installer you can easily set
a local TTF file as default font just
copy or save the TTF file to your device
select the font from the list on the
local tab then tap on install to set it
as default font after your device
automatically reboots the custom font
should now be applied this default font
you can also select from five installers
online collection of fonts to select a
font from the server tab then download
and install the font afterwards your
device should reboot in order to apply
the new font the iPod app has functions
similar to those in font installer if
you have a rooted none Samsung device
you can still use the iPod app to change
fonts so use a local TTF file as default
font first copy the file to I fonts
custom fonts directory on your device
then specify the correct font mode if
you have a rooted none Samsung device
choose system mode if you have a rooted
Samsung device choose samsung mode then
just choose your fonts from the custom
tab and set it as default font depending
on the mode you've set your device will
either apply the new font right away or
reboot
to apply the new font or if you want to
use a font from I fonts online catalog
just go to the online tab tap on the
font you want to use tap the set button
and allow your device to apply the new
font if you want to play around with
custom fonts the manual way on your
Android you have two choices to use the
Android debug bridge or ADB or to use a
file manager app ADB requires a computer
and some knowledge of the command-line
if you're up for it
see this videos companion article on
Android Authority comm for more info
using a file manager app is much easier
the file manager app must be able to
navigate to the root directory in this
example I'll use my favorite file
manager ES File Explorer but you can
choose any file manager app that you
want first copy or save a TT ephod file
to your device preferably in the slash
sdcard directory then make sure that ES
File Explorer is able to navigate up to
root level make sure to also enable the
mount filesystem option afterwards go to
the slash system slash fonts directory
be careful here because this is a system
directory you can mess up your device if
you make mistakes here look for the
system font that you want to replace in
this case Roboto - regular TTFN
you must rename it to something else the
renamed file will be your backup go back
to where you saved your new font file
rename it into exactly the same filename
as the target font file then copy the
imposter font file to the slash system
slash fonts directory thereafter make
the copied file readable to user group
and other also make the file write table
by user the properties dialog for the
file should look like this never forget
the step many hearts have been broken
and many a phone has boot loops because
the new files permissions are incorrect
lastly reboot your device and cross your
fingers and here we go my new custom
font is now applied to many parts of the
user interface and so whatever font
changing method you choose I can
sure you that your days of boring
default font faces will be over just
find a method that works and be very
careful when dealing with a rooted
device for more Android guides news and
