name is Jace and the Android gods have
decreed that Android Authority hosts
should do some sort of five fun facts
about me or answer five non tech related
questions that we get so for example
what does it look like behind the scenes
hmm it's a hack job okay
lights green screen more lights and like
hacked lamp lights it ain't pretty so
yes one of the most popular non tech
related questions I get is what is your
background and how did you get into tech
news well I'm originally from here I
went to school to study theatre and
musical theater yeah I'm talking like to
nah yeah seriously but then I got the
opportunity to tour with educational
theaters and toured many different
countries and got a chance to learn all
those languages had a great time I was
here here here and here and countless
other places and I loved it but then you
know kids came along and suddenly I was
a stay-at-home dad with very little time
to myself
except for late at night when the
kiddies were asleep then most of my
spare time was doing this and as any of
you hardcore gamers will know when you
get obsessed with it you want to start
building your own rig building your own
PC it's cheaper and you can maximize
then that a power you have in your rig I
played competitive first-person shooters
starting with rogues spear way back in
2001 by 2005 I was playing battlefield 2
and I joined a clan tag night night
stalkers regimen and eventually a dull
gamers pub and I was with them for
several years great group of guys and we
played like almost every day but that
really started my fascination with tech
in the whole tech world and how it's
changing our lives and so I got right
into it I was listening to this week in
tech Leo Laporte and all his crew there
and I'm still an avid fan of Leo and so
I started my own YouTube channel called
how to become TV it's still up and
running it's moderately small it's only
like six thousand subscribers but it got
me started and I would interview
successful people in their career so if
you were searching for how to become a
teacher
for example you can found my videos
there on YouTube and you would you know
it would help you pursue that career in
the best way you can but I found that
most people were interested in my tech
related videos the how to become a
software developer or engineer videos
and so I just devoted all the energies
and resources of the channel just on
software engineering and took off a
little bit got a little bit more
interest but that got the attention of
xda-developers and they invited me to
audition for them and I made shows for
them and I think a lot of you found me
there on XDA last year I did that for
about seven eight months I was like an
internship I got paid almost nothing but
I learned a lot and I was great too a
great opportunity to do it I'm really
grateful they took me on but that got
the attention of Andres thority and the
DND the Android gods as we call them
they contacted me and I got to join
Android Authority and so that's how that
happened the second question is how do I
become a tech journalist yeah so I'm a
little queasy and I answering that
question because I don't consider myself
a tech journalist per se I'm more of a
tech pundit I try and sift through the
information and give you an educated
opinion so it saves you some work but
this question has come up repeatedly and
so I wanted to talk about what new media
has done and how this has really changed
the game I mean in the past you needed a
degree and you need to get it you know
you know an internship somewhere in some
sort of publication and it's you can
still do that but it has changed
dramatically because the barrier of
entry to get into this is so much lower
in some ways it's actually harder not
easier so what I would recommend is that
you start your own channel your own blog
your own you know outlets so in some
manner and demonstrate that you can
build an audience that you can keep
people's attention and that it can be
linked to and referred to and talk to
them once you do that you can then apply
to someplace like Android Authority or
whatever publication you want to work
for and demonstrate that you can get
attention I mean that's really how it
works if I had contacted Andrew
authority 18 months ago they probably
would have said you know you got to
prove yourself a little bit more so
that's what you need to do build a
portfolio that demonstrates your skills
and ability so fun fact
me that many of you will not know but
people who know me personally know that
one of my obsessions are dogs that's
right when I like something I tend to
geek out on it just pour lots of energy
into it so there was several years where
every day I would read about dogs dog
history dog breeding dog breeding
practices and the purposes for which
those breeds were created so I have this
uncanny uncanny ability where I someone
can point to any dog pure breed or a
mutt and I can tell you what breeds make
up that mutt or if it's a purebred where
that purebred comes from no matter how
rare the breed and what where the best
breeders are to find that breed and what
are the functions of that breed their
original functions of that breed so for
example this is a Central Asian of
charka and such relation of charka is
regarded as the original kind of
Godfather of dogs the bridge the missing
link you could say between wolves and
and dogs many people think it's the
Tibetan Mastiff because it's one of the
oldest breeds it's not there's recent
research that debunks that but in one of
my favorite breeds is called the
renaissance bulldog not Renaissance but
Wren a sense Bulldog it's one of the
family of alternative bulldogs or Old
English Bulldogs breeders have tried to
recreate the original healthy Bulldog of
old and not the crippled one that we
commonly see today yeah dogs love it wow
this is going look expected last
question is what is the future of
Android Weekly or Android QA
and Android QA actually has some news
coming up we're going to change things a
little bit the show is still going on
and I'll still answer your questions but
we've found a way where we can answer
more people's questions and go to harder
questions because I'm sort of confined
to general more mainstream questions
here on the show but I'm going to put
out a show this week that's going to
address that so watch for that but as
far as the news Android Weekly
originally when the Android gods and I
talked about this it was all about
trying to be the Jon Stewart or the
Stephen Colbert of Android news right to
take something that is fun in
formative and educational I mean there's
just a plethora of tech news out there
and you've got to find a way to
distinguish yourself in a way that's
kind of true
to you and and who you are and so for me
I read all your comments and I know
especially in the first month or two
there's a lot of people not a lot you
know maybe 10% of the people complaining
that it was you know too much humor for
humor sake and I took that to heart and
I think in some cases that was true some
not but I try to make the humor relevant
to the Android news that I'm actually
referring to it I think I'm getting
better at that because I do want to make
something that's really informative but
also fun so love your feedback on that I
should see you guys later on next week's
Android Weekly coming up this weekend
and tomorrow's Android Q&amp;amp;A see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
