everybody and this is a portrait of me
that will come back to a little bit
later welcome to this camera comparison
between the samsung galaxy s 9 and the
Google pixel to excel now we're looking
at the s 9 plus and that doesn't change
things up too much but the s 9 plus does
have a zoom lens so you get that
telephoto but on top of that are all of
the different enhancements that Samsung
put into its main lens mainly the dual
aperture F 1.5 and F 2.4 are available
because of actual blades in the lens
we've documented that quite a bit
already here at Andrew authorities so
make sure you check out our full review
and in these camera comparisons you can
head over to Andrew authority comm for
the full galleries between these two
devices but also take a look at the huge
comparison we did including the galaxy s
8 and the iPhone 10 now they're gonna be
a lot of different shots where we can
chime in and give a little bit of
perspective but what we wanted to do in
this video is pass it off to all of you
let us know which of these photos in all
of the examples that you like more
whether they come from the pixel to
excel or the galaxy s 9 plus now of
course the galaxy s 9 plus has a much
different philosophy from the pixel to
Excel Google uses machine learning and
all of the different photos that they've
amassed over the years in order to do
good data processing and that's why they
only have one camera on the back so that
no matter what photo you're trying to
get it's going to use all of that
algorithmic processing to create the
best final result now as you've probably
seen in the last few photos there's a
lot to like about the color in either of
these phones but the galaxy s 9 plus
seems to expose a little bit more the
pixel to excel tends to go a little bit
more contrasty and also a bit lower on
its exposure which usually makes colors
kind of pop out more and it makes sure
that detail is at the forefront
however in mid light situations like
going indoors the galaxy s 9 plus
exposes subjects a bit better which is
going to be more preferable as the light
starts to go dimmer if there isn't an
amazing amount of light on the subject
or on the scene the Samsung contestant
just better exposes the image capturing
brighter and more vibrant colors as well
as good detail even when there's not a
whole lot of light lighting everything
up in terms of detail it's going to be a
toss-up between these two because
they're doing very different things to
capture the best possible scene
Google's device captures usually the
overall better picture in terms of
contrast and color usually in low-light
shots that pixel to excel seems a little
bit more detailed but the galaxy s 9
plus is a bit softer because it's more
focused on making a better exposed to
shot rather than the most detailed shot
possible case in point going back
indoors in a low-light shots especially
with this food that we're looking at the
galaxy s 9 over exposes a little bit
which does get rid of some of the detail
so the galaxy s 9 plus is trying to make
sure that in dark situations you still
get a usable photo but it's not going to
necessarily be the best detailed the
fact that the pixel to excel renders a
bit more contrast II usually leads to
more stylized photos and in broad
daylight shots especially in landscape
shots it might mean that the shadows are
a bit darker than they should be in
order to depict the proper scene the
galaxy s 9 plus because it is always
trying to expose pretty much everything
in the shot then in landscapes the
galaxy s 9 is a little bit better at
showing the diverse colors and the
textures within the scene and we talked
a lot about algorithmic processing but
it is sort of the super-powered version
of HDR plus which was pioneered by the
Google pixel originally what it's
basically doing is getting as many
photos and as many shots of the same
scene so that it can put all of them
together to create the best possible
final shot now the galaxy s 9 plus now
has this as well with multi frame
processing thanks to the RAM built into
the camera module but the pixel to excel
just has way more data to pull from that
means that low-light shots that are
using HDR to expose and to render the
scene properly are a little bit better
that just means that in low-light
situations when using HDR the pixel 2xo
just is able to get a little bit more
detail out of certain spots that are
uneven with the rest of the scene this
is one prime example while the galaxy s
9 Plus does expose the photo a little
bit better so you are able to use it in
good low-light situations the pixel to
excel just tries to marry all of those
good aspects into one good photo and
finally we can talk about selfies or
more specifically portraits both of
these cameras have a proper portrait
mode on the rear cameras while the
Samsung Galaxy S 9 uses a dual lens
setup to achieve its effects but where
the pixel 2 really shines is on the
front-facing camera because it has that
portrait mode built into it
even if it's not the most powerful
front-facing camera that pixel to is
processing really does a good job of
bringing probably some of the best
selfies we've seen the Galaxy S nine
plus on the front-facing camera also has
selfie Focus which softens things even
more because it's trying to make a
bouquet effect behind the front subject
the rear portrait mode on the s9 plus
does do a slightly better job of
figuring out where the subject is but it
also can get messed up from time to time
and so there you have it a comparison
between the Samsung Galaxy S nine plus
and the Pixar 2 XL cameras we really
want to know what you guys think about
these and we just wanted to provide some
perspective on some of the photos that
we took while out in LA so really the
gap between these two phones is not all
that big the galaxy s 9 plus has more
features in terms of what you can do
with the camera while the pixel 2xl kind
of keeps things more simplistic and is
more of an auto shooter we will say that
on a more consistent basis the s 9 plus
is able to expose scenes better in
low-light shots but the pixel to excel
is really trying to make sure that
detail is what it focuses on the most
and I mean that the photo is a little
bit less exposed compared to the s 9 but
it really matters what you want out of
your photo and that's what we want to
hear from you in the comments down below
comparing cameras is always a subjective
matter but we try to just provide you
with this video and with the gallery at
and rathore decom so you can enjoy
photos from these two great cameras so
let us know what you think in the
comments down below which one you would
pick and let us know why after that you
can head on over to Andrew authority
comm for reviews of both of these
devices and for more comparisons and
more of the best from Android Authority
because we are of course your source for
all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
