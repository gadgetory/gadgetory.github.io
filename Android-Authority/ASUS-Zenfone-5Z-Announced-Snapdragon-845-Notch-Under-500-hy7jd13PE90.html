everybody and you can see me here
rocking the Asus zenfone 5 which has
just been announced but the 5z is what
we're talking about in this video
because it was announced at their press
event on top of the ones that you
already saw in Lon's video so make sure
you go and check that out it comes with
a 6.2 inch screen about a 19 by 9 aspect
ratio because one of that 19 is used for
a bit of a notch at the top just for the
notification area there is a nice little
feature there where you're able to see
the other notification icons if you just
tap the top portion of the screen but
everything plays underneath the notch so
you still get a full screen experience
aesthetically the zenfone 5 Z looks
exactly like the zenfone 5 but it gets a
bump up in its specifications the
performance is powered by a Snapdragon
845 it comes with 6 gigabytes of RAM and
a lot of storage you can get up to 256
gigabytes of storage on this phone
making it an incredibly powerful phone
you also get all of the same other
features from the zenfone 5 including
the stereo speakers and to the ability
to play high res audio and of course all
of the artificial intelligence features
including a are charging AI scene
detection ai portrait in AI boost and
the same camera experience is available
with a wide angle lens on the rear
camera to bolster the already existing
12 megapixel shooter with an F 1.8
aperture now while coming out in June so
you have to wait a little while the best
part about this phone is that it's
priced under five hundred dollars which
is an incredible price for a phone that
rocks all of this including the latest
Snapdragon 845 that we have yet to see
in more phones so far but here's a bit
of a sward for you the zenfone 5 Z
actually was not shown at the event we
just wanted to make sure to have this
video out so we can announce to you that
it actually exists they kept it under
wraps for the stage at their press
conference and the phone that you've
been seeing me use here is actually the
zenfone 5 like we said it looks exactly
like this n phone 5 Z but we wanted to
take this time to bring you a video so
you knew about the snapdragon 845 toting
version of a Seuss's new zenfone 5 line
if you need more about the other phones
and more about the 5c you can keep it
tuned to android authority and don't
forget to watch lawns video regarding
the other two zenfone 5 devices keep it
tuned here to andrew authority for more
about this powerhouse from masseuse and
then head on over to andrew authority
comm because of course here at MWC 2018
we are your source for all things
