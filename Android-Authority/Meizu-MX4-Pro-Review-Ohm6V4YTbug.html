translation from the chinese market
turned out to be a pretty solid device
with quite a bit to offer but with a pro
version meizu has upped the ante in just
about every aspect does it provide a
real upgrade not just from the original
but for the budding user well let's find
out because it's Josh regard from
Android authority what's going on
everybody and this is my review of the
meizu mx4pro the mx4pro takes on the
same aesthetic of the original with a
look that is a bit like the iPhone 3GS
of old right down to a home button found
on the bottom front but this time around
it is quite larger mostly due to a 5.5
inch screen this phone is just outside
the realm of comfort in one hand those
small bezels on the sides of the screen
certainly help its case as already
stated the home button up front is the
main Edition here and has a great
tactile feel push it down and you'll be
able to wake up the phone but underneath
the surface is a fingerprint scanner
that we'll get into in the hardware
segment curves on the side include the
volume rocker on the right side though
the power button is at the top there's
just no way around it for most Android
users the top located power button takes
a little bit to get used to the back is
removable and sports a nice non-glossy
feel underneath the cover you won't be
able to replace the battery though and
ports for the headphone jack in the
microUSB charging port are on the top
and bottom respectively with the latter
also accompanied by a bottom facing
speaker unit and all of this is held
together with a nice silver lining via a
metallic frame ultimately this is a
phone that isn't too flashy but still
manages to have a look all of its own in
the hand the smooth plastic does have a
tendency to slip about which sometimes
exacerbates the accentuated curves of
the mx4pro
I didn't have that many issues keeping
my grip on the phone but a little extra
care was taken when trying to perform
the hand gymnastics needed to get around
the screen I will look at just how much
the pro brings to the table begins with
the display that is actually beyond quad
HD as meizu has done in previous
iterations the aspect ratio of the
display is just a little bit off kilter
and thus a bit more resolution in the
shorter edge can be squeezed in as a
result 1440p essentially becomes
15:36 P this small bump up in resolution
is certainly not really felt in regular
usage but the pro manages to be on par
with the many other quad HD displays
that we're seeing in current gen
smartphones that being said however this
display is quite a nice performer
despite the muted aesthetic of the
default blimey OS theme the colors still
look pretty vibrant and stand out due to
some good contrast what the theme does
really well to showcase is the sharpness
of this display as 546 pixels per inch
do well to accentuate the edges of fly
me spics Allart where I had an
exceptional time with the device was
during gameplay as even the older
textures and colors of Star Wars Knights
of the Old Republic were made quite
enjoyable on the mx4pro viewing angles
all looked good and in broad daylight I
had few complaints and with Gorilla
Glass 3 covering this panel there should
be better protection against typical
scratches Mesa has returned to their
original supplier for processing
packages Samsung and in the pro they
opted for the pretty tried-and-true
Exynos 5 octa that is backed by a Mali
t6 28 and 3 gigabytes of RAM I had few
issues with the performance of the
mx4pro as the fly me OS showed really
nice movement through its elements and
apps multitasking proved to be a good
experience despite its more simplistic
interface but tapping in and out of two
applications over and over again was a
very quick experience again my main
enjoyment came from gaming here as
Knights of the Old Republic was nice and
smooth at the default settings
I pushed the graphics performance
further by maxing out the settings but
even then the game was still playable it
was at normal settings however that the
game never missed a beat to start off
the hardware section will talk about the
speakers found on the bottom while we
always harp on rear or side mounted
speakers compared to front facing units
Mesa has managed to make the sound
experience on the pro quite compelling
sound is not only more than adequately
loud the soundstage is actually quite
robust bringing richness and body to
mids and lows where plenty of other
speaker units simply fail
and with a hi-fi enhancement option
available in the settings the same great
sound experience is available when
plugging a pair of headphones in the
good news continues with the fingerprint
reader under the front home button this
is a press type or Vader meaning you
just have to rest your finger on top
what makes the suite are so good however
is the fact that you can wake the phone
with that same button press down wake
the phone keep your finger in place and
the phone is unlocked meizu claims that
you can go from prone to working in
about half a seconds and while I haven't
actually timed it it certainly feels
pretty fast
you can also set fingerprints to unlock
apps and other portions of the phone
ultimately it's a very reliable
fingerprint reader and I know that
because for a few days there I actually
forgot what my unlock pattern was during
that time I just kept using my thumbs to
easily unlock the phone and that was
more than good enough what was actually
a bit of a sore spot for me was in the
connectivity now I completely understand
that a phone from a foreign market might
have some trouble connecting to the
mobile networks here in the West but
using my t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T SIM card
simply did not get me faster than 3G
internet on here and even then
connectivity was spotty at best I'm sure
that versions of this phone that are
made for the West will definitely fare a
lot better
that was just my experience with this
particular phone and in battery I also
had a pretty uneven experience a phablet
sized 33 50 milliamp hour battery is in
the mx4pro and while it should be able
to make the phone last quite a while I
simply didn't really have that
experience now to begin with having
mobile network connectivity issues made
it tough for me to have real day-to-day
usage on here and be able to test the
battery life on there but I still had
some interesting incidents mainly
overnight when I had this phone
basically on standby as you can see here
it drained the battery overnight now
it's something that happened more times
than not and I thought that it was
because I had abs running in the
background but even when I fixed for
that I still had a couple of instances
where the phone would be dead in the
morning when I left it maybe around 75%
I will say that more recently this
hasn't been an issue but it happens more
times than is negligible otherwise I
have been able to get a solid day out of
the pro before getting down to single
digits but we have to remember that this
is without the high speed internet as a
factor
a powerful 20.7 megapixel rear camera
provides very solid performance in the
mx4pro large pictures are par for the
course here as the front facing camera
sports a little more power to at 5
megapixels the app provides a number of
different modes and settings mostly
found by swiping side to side on the
viewfinder modes from panorama to
slow-motion video to even a fully manual
mode are available settings in the auto
mode include HDR which does a pretty
good job of improving color output on a
shot though without the higher
saturation this effect is essentially
what night mode produces the macro mode
proved fun to use though I found it a
little odd that the auto mode doesn't
automatically activate the macro focus
based upon the shot basically if you
aren't able to get focused on a close
subject just swipe over to macro and
then you'll probably be able to get it
done and for self-portraits there is the
beautify mode Asian market phones are so
known for here's a shot of me normally
and then a shot of me as you can see via
screenshots showing that all the
settings are at max videos in 4k can be
captured and they look mostly good
though a lack of stabilization might
make them finicky at times and
slow-motion video can be captured at
720p resolution at a speed of 100 frames
per second export it out to 25 frames
per second picture quality was actually
quite good for the mx4pro
as details were very well captured and
colors looked appealing when you could
capture them correctly I say this
because I found exposure and white
balance and auto mode to be a little bit
jumpy you have to be sure that what you
want to get is what you see in the
viewfinder nonetheless when you can get
a good shot off you can be certain it's
going to be pretty good even in
low-light situations the camera manages
to bring about a pretty nice result and
if you needed a boost the HDR and night
modes will do well to enhance the scene
just keep your hands as steady as you
can when doing so my only real gripe
with the camera was a bit of a slow auto
focusing time the pros certainly isn't
the worst performer here but it also
isn't the best either and finally in
software we get the fly me OS a
different take on Android that is a bit
more simplistic than its more well known
competitors what you see is what you get
in this interface as there is no app
drawer and all icons does have to be
arranged in folders for organization you
may have noticed by now that there are
no capacitive keys on this device
and this is because contextual softkeys
appear when needed in applications to go
backward the home button is your friend
the notification drop-down has a slew of
different options available and in the
settings area different panels are used
to navigate the many options
the only real hidden area in fly me is
the recent apps interface which is
accessible via a swipe up from the
bottom of the screen thankfully though
all of this is customizable via a theme
engine that as me as it was so nice to
point out will be mostly in Chinese for
the moment speaking of translations
there are a few holes in the text of the
device as obviously there was room to
fit the many elements of Chinese
characters but when translated into
English the phrases might be too long
for these menus and also some of the
literal translations themselves can be a
bit uneven that all being said I
actually enjoy what I see in the fly me
OS it might be really simplistic but
then again that's something I do tend to
like in operating systems the soft keys
on the bottom in that contextual bar
remain one of my favorite parts but
another bright spot was in the keyboard
where you could actually swipe down from
one of the letters in order to get to
the numbers and symbols easily rather
than just holding down I never felt
overwhelmed by the elements though that
could change if you have too many
applications installed when converting
the price from Asia the phone comes in
around 400 dollars so we wouldn't be
surprised if the Western retail price
would be closer to about 500 dollars
unlocked it's not a bad price point but
plenty of other phones in the Asian
market have compelling experiences to
offer and can Rock similar or even lower
price tags in this new year it remains
to be seen just how much better the
phones get in a market our Western
viewers may not be so familiar with at
the moment
and for that notion the meizu mx4 serves
as a good example of what growth we're
seeing out of China even just a couple
weeks ago at CES 2015 we saw a few new
high quality but affordable iterations
from Chinese companies and the trend
looks to be on the rise meizu is in the
thick of that with a phablet offering
that manages to be powerful but
accessible at the same time its design
choices aside the shell is just a casing
for all of the power that is found
underneath a quad HD display good
performance an enjoyable soundstage and
an above-average camera all make the
mx4pro a package we do hope to see in
the West pretty soon being fully
outfitted for Western markets would
certainly
alleviate the problems I had with my
particular units well it might not stand
out that much but dig a little deeper
and you'll find yourself a fun and
powerful phone in the mx4pro as always
thank you guys very much for watching
and I hope you enjoyed this review of
the meizu mx4pro
it's larger version of the original
brings even more power underneath and it
happens to be an enjoyable experience
because of it it is a pretty good phone
but we don't know when it's going to
come to the west but you can stay tuned
and see if it does here at Android
