handy the Android authority app guy do
you like live wallpapers I know I do and
after the intro will show you the best
live wallpapers for Android first on our
list is androids Pro live wallpaper like
pretty much every wallpaper on this list
there is a free and a paid version also
like pretty much every wallpaper on this
list the free version is just like the
paid version except for you don't have
access to all the settings androids Pro
is a fun wallpaper if you're a big fan
of Android and also if you like
something that isn't so busy in your
background you can choose from a variety
of shapes a variety of movement patterns
and all in a variety of colors you can
flood your screen with a variety of
bouncing shapes if you want to or just
have a single Andy floating around for
this broad range of customizations
Android pro has earned a spot on this
list next on the list is Christmas rink
live wallpaper this festive yet simple
live wallpaper helps capture the spirit
of Christmas by depicting a bunch of
people randomly ice skating across your
home screen you can even interact with
them a bit as tapping on a skater makes
them go faster in terms of customization
Christmas rink doesn't have a lot of
them you can change the skaters in the
snow physics but what you see is pretty
much what you get that's fine because
what you get looks pretty good if
Christmas isn't your thing there are a
variety of holidays available from the
same developer if you watch our app
videos on a regular basis then device
info live wallpaper should look pretty
familiar device info live wallpaper
doesn't try to be gorgeous for unique
instead it is probably the most useful
wallpaper on the list it displays a
number of system stats including
temperature RAM and CPU usage storage
time and some fun ones like tilt
encompass you can customize how this
wallpaper looks as well each measurement
is modular so you can move them around
as you please or remove them entirely if
you don't want them there additionally
you can change the colors to make it
match whatever theme you have on your
device gold future interface live
wallpaper is next on our list and it's
one of our favorites it features a very
de use X type look and feel so if you're
looking for something a little more
modern but still has a decent amount of
Flair then this could be the live
wallpaper for you in terms of
customization there isn't much you can
change the clock location and type and
also tinker with a few of the elements
in the background things like color will
stay the same no matter what so if you
don't like the gold premise then you may
not like this one Koya live wallpaper is
among the most beautiful on our list if
you give this one a shot you'll be
treated to a pond with all the koi fish
you could ever want on there tapping the
screen makes the water ripple tapping
the fish frightens them and sends them
scare
off and double-tapping actually lets you
feed the fish there are a lot of
customization options for koi live
wallpaper there are a number of
different pond themes fish colors and
you can even control things like how
much the water ripples when you tap the
screen once you find the settings you
like it really is a tranquil and
gorgeous live wallpaper to have on your
device snow fall live wallpaper has been
around for a while long enough to be
considered a classic in this simple live
wallpaper you'll be treated to a tree
line in the winter obviously it snows in
this live wallpaper and trees will sway
when you switch home screens there are a
plethora of ways to customize it you can
change the background to night or day
one of our favorite features is the
ability to have it change automatically
based on what time it is you can also
add the aurora borealis if you want some
more color lastly if you're in a
Christmasy kind of mood you can have
Santa Claus fly across the screen at
random intervals based on how far away
it is from actual Christmas thunderstorm
is another one of those classic
wallpapers that seems to have been
around forever and this one your
background turns into well a
thunderstorm complete with rain and
cloud movement it's a good-looking live
wallpaper especially for storm
aficionados where this app really shines
is customization you can have it look
pretty much how you want want lightning
to appear on screen taps it can be done
one orange lightning on a green
background you can do that too with
rainfall physics and cloud cover
completely customizable as well you can
really make this background look however
you want it to for Texas galaxy live
wallpaper is last on our list if you're
a fan of space scape backgrounds pay
attention because this one is for you
when you set vortex galaxy it slowly
fades into a colorful and beautiful
space gape that any space lover should
enjoy in terms of customization vortex
galaxy has among the fewest of any app
on this list you really can't change a
lot and the changes you can make aren't
all that noticeable so if you don't like
the way it looks when you first use it
you probably won't like it at all
however if a slow-moving gorgeous space
scape is your thing then you probably
will if you take a look at the
leaderboard you can see how all of these
apps stack up against one another as of
now forget everything you thought you
knew about our ranking system because we
don't have one these ranks are based on
how you the people rated them in the
Google Play Store all we did was tell
you about it also an honorable mention
goes out to a live wallpaper called
magic but while it isn't ranked high
enough to be included on the list
it was insisted that we give it an
honourable mention in this video if
jiggly badonkadonks are your thing you
may want to check out magic but there
are thousands of live wallpapers out
there and these are just among the best
if we forgot a particularly awesome live
or you'd like to share with us your
favorite feel free to leave a comment
