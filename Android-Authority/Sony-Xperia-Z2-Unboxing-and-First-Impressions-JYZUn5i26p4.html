really been trying to step up their game
in the flagship device Department so
we're really excited to see what they
have in store with this next iteration
hey it's Josh regard for management
authority what's going on everybody and
it's time to unbox and give my first
impressions on the Sony Xperia z2 all
right and here we are with the Sony
Xperia z2 in this unboxing I will say
that this box is actually a lot larger
than what I remembered the original is
z1 and the Xperia Z before it were sort
of packaged in this one's a lot wider
and also a lot taller to be fair but
we'll go ahead and see what it is that
makes this so much larger box than I'm
used to so let's go and open that lid so
we have some initial documentation here
right on the front I will just go ahead
and put that aside a little consequence
we're going to go ahead and just get the
device out so this is our first look at
the actual device it looks really nice
already it's the white version which I'm
really excited for because the white
version looked even nicer than the black
on black that we saw at the Mobile World
Congress in Barcelona Spain so I'm gonna
go ahead and put this aside for a second
and we'll just take a look at the
contents inside of the box so take this
flat out and here we are so from what
the looks of it we have the usual
standard fare but some extra bits on the
side we'll start with the usual bits
like the wall plug that goes straight
into the wall and adapts the microUSB
charging cable which is right here these
are two things that you're usually going
to find anyway so go and just stack that
right there and then underneath what
look like the headphones added in with
this is the other documentation so this
is also something that we're not
surprised to find there is actually some
documentation for the headphones
themselves which means they're probably
a little bit higher quality than the
standard fare you would find so let's
take a look at those so here are the
headphones and looks like there's a
little bit of coloration here it looks
like they're they're a little bit more
special than the kind of headphones you
would normally get the more like
standard generic earbuds that you would
find there you go oh yeah these look
like they are one of the higher end ones
available so we'll take a look at those
a little bit closer as you can see here
that also comes with the
extra buds there that has a little bit
of color in them for some extra style so
here are the high quality earbuds that
we're going to definitely take a look at
a little bit it's always nice to see
these manufacturers adding in some high
quality accessories in with their phones
and that is also what we're gonna find
here looks like there's a small piece
right here that might be for just a
little bit of an add-on for this which
is something I'm really excited about
some I heard that this might be added in
this is a dog that actually takes
advantage of those pogo pins in that are
on the side of the phone in order for
some charging so you can see right there
there's the micro USB charging ports and
then you put this on its side onto the
dock and it just is a nice elegant way
of using those pins that I used to
complain about a lot with the Xperia Z
and the z1 after it that those pins were
not necessarily being used that docking
port was not being used to its proper
advantage and it looks like it is this
time and it is included in the Xperia z2
box as we see here there you go and you
can already see the shine coming from
the glass on the back of the phone
coming through the light there and now
we can get over to the front and
you can see already here from just the
screen that the bezels have been brought
down it's a common complaint with Xperia
devices that the bezels on the left and
right and also the top and bottom are
just very large but at least on the
sides they have been really brought down
to size as you can see there there
really isn't that much distance between
the very end of the phone and where the
screen starts to display the top and
bottom still have quite a bit of girth
to them but that's kind of a small price
to pay when you already have great
bezels on the sides that will help with
the handling you can see that my thumb
finds it easy to just sort of reach to
the other side of the phone and it's not
that hard to maneuver from there and
also the great handling on on the actual
device itself given to given because of
those slightly more rounded edges
especially in the corners really makes
for a device that is very attractive it
has a look that really only Sony puts
out there and it's definitely been one
of their defining traits and in the end
what we have here is a very very
attractive device all around inside and
out so keep it tuned to Android
authority for all of the best coverage
including all of the coverage of the
Sony Xperia z2 we just got this phone at
our doorstep you just watched the
unboxing and my first impressions on it
and our first impressions in a nutshell
are we're really excited to put this
phone through all of its paces so keep
it tuned here for all of that and for
even more coverage at Android authority
