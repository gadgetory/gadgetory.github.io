here with spot coil from next bit one of
the coolest products to come out a
kickstarter last year and pretty much in
my opinion ever we've already gone
hands-on with the next bit Robin last
year at September but what we've got
here is a much more working model as
well as a new color and Scott's going to
talk us through some of the improvements
has happened since our initial hands-on
and then i'll give you some of my
opinions and we'll just have a
conversation about where next bits going
from here cool thank you for coming down
and them yeah we had obviously came I
came and saw you guys here in Vegas in
September yep it was really the one
changed since then what's changed and
what's been improved what kind of
growing pains have you had in the last
few months well you know I mean product
development it's messy it's the reality
and so when we because we did
Kickstarter all that's been kind of
exposed to people not only to you but to
kind of people out there in the world
and so you know we had phones in
September when we met and they were okay
quality but the whole goal between
September and now and we're basically
about ready to ship is kind of dialing
everything in making sure that the gaps
between the parts making sure that that
are perfect making sure that the
machining is looking right making sure
that the paint finishes a ride that's on
the hardware side and then on though and
then on the software side you know what
you saw were kind of early prototypes
I'm yes it was working kind of you know
what I mean so we had kind of high
confidence level but now what you're
looking at is a phone where where it's
kind of starting all get dialed in you
know the the the I use one is my daily
driver now every day and it's terrific
you know but we're filing bugs every day
I'm kind of what that's like to kind of
live with the phone living the you know
making sure not only the kind of core
functionality of the software is there
but also kind of our enhanced cloud
functionality I kind of allowing
everybody to not run out of space on
their phone kind of bringing that kind
of cloud first approach to the operating
system I mean that was one of probably
my favorite things about the next bit
Robin is that where others have just
gone oh here's microSD we've tried to
take you taking the approach in a
completely different way of how do we
just be different and that's what you
have said the Robin and the next big
cloud is where is what really sets the
phone apart
jab a quick play and I mean when I saw
this in September it was we agree was
not a janky was an early prototype shafi
but broke one that I hope people don't
know that you broke one actually diary
yes I think we can admit this in this
video I was a we're still here talking
to us but yes I managed to break one of
their what happens with early prototype
see the reality is that you like you
discover like oh we did this oh there's
a problem let's figure out a mechanical
engineering fix for that or there's a
doubly fix for that or a software fix
for that so that's rather I broke it
then we found out later on and I will
say one thing right down to the hardware
just this feels a lot more like I said a
there were early prototypes it was the
build was there but it was it was ok
what we've got here now is a fun I think
anyone would be happy to use i will say
that just playing with the phone itself
like this it's so snappy which wasn't
there before and I'm really happy I know
guess what is now any app can we use
with the cloud right so we can just up
no thing do it anymore information you
want to reveal about the cloud and the
pricing or anything like that well I
don't think is any new information it is
available for pre-order now for 399 us
we're gonna stop pre-orders on january
fifteenth and that's mainly because when
we actually ship both the kickstarter
units which are all going out in
February as well as pre-orders we're
gonna have limited quantity just kind of
coming up the production ramp so that's
so we're going to end that this pre
orders in a january fifteenth and i
think the goal there is actually deliver
all kind of kick starter units and
pre-orders in the month of februari our
retail store our e-commerce store will
go live also on February's 16 so we're
excited about that and it'll be lots
more information about robin and next
bit on there as well as forums kind of
launching the forums and moving that
kind of dialogue from Kickstarter onto
our website but then also kind of having
that dialogue where people want to have
it whether it's on social the forums or
wherever you want to make sure people
have a lot of avenues to kind of ask us
questions and have a conversation about
what we're doing and that's really
what's that you guys apart it's not just
the here's a phone and there's no often
sells it really is kind of just we want
to bring people into the next bit
ecosystem and make people happy yeah I
think you know I think it really came
from this kind of concept well if we had
already started the phone we were
talking about
our brand to be and feel like the
industrial design is fresh we've taken
kind of a disruptive approach of baking
the cloud in the operating system and
we're kinda like you know we want
something that kind of feels more i
think if i look at traditional marketing
you know pretty person holds phone on
the stage we film them we all watch that
video like oh I can be pretty or I'll
hang out with those people I'm going to
go buy that phone we just feel like
that's I don't know it just feels like
BS to be honest with you doesn't feel
like vintage and so we wanted to create
something that really reflected the
values of us as a person of people which
translate in the company and I think
that means having some transparency and
having an open dialogue with people and
having you know getting their feedback
and understanding what they want us to
do not to say we're always going to be
able to do that but but I think people
want to have a say in what we're doing I
think you could see that on a
kickstarter you know we have like 10
times the engagement of the other top 25
tech products on kickstarter which was
powerful its powerful just kind of
seeing people and the one always good by
the way its people are telling us like
you know you guys have you need to do
this you need do that but it was super
super fun to kind of be a part of that
process and we learned so much from it I
agree completely i mean just on the
subject of kickstarter because we've
obviously seen before that we've got the
available in these two colors which i
saw and then there's really really cool
I mean I wish I big back this on
Kickstarter want this color you can get
it you can't get it there you go guys I
on I've missed out there any of you want
to send us over to me feel free because
this is probably one of the favorite my
favorite color of the lot although you
can get it in these to the kickstarter
exclusive color you guys allowed
kick-started to choose this color base
that's right that's right so we
basically asked people to submit what
they wanted we put a file out there so
people could do in their own colorway
we've got something like 350 entries and
then we try to look for some trends sign
of some common ground between the
entries basically picked five and then
people voted on which one they want to
see an electric was the one I mean it is
pretty hot it all of this ice is like
and the other colors are really really
nice and I mean I personally would say
cause I can't get the kickstart one the
gray is just screamed out the other
night and it
the thing that set to pop more than
anything is it's just got the other
color button on there just just just
just fall that's right just going to be
different it's like a little subtle
color reading a little pop into the
world yeah and that's exactly what you
need em so tell us what was the
inspiration behind the design of this
and write down to you know as I said in
our hands on we've gone it's also kind
of gone circle around the front and the
back which I remember you telling me
about yeah what was the design behind
that white why go with that and not say
rounded curves and the things that the
the more traditional design that we see
now sure you know worked on a lot of
phones in my life and you know there's a
lot of different kind of voices and
input on in the design process not that
it's bad it just it kind of leads to
kind of a lot of different value kind of
conversations and kind of what you want
to do so with this particular design I
just wanted to do something a little bit
more personal so if that kind of
reflected kind of my value set and I
think the hope there it's not that my
advice is the best phone after but the
hope was that you know hopefully there's
enough common ground there with people
that are there going to be potentially
buying our phone are going to like it
and that's the hope and I think that's
kind of it's one of the things about I
think good design should be provocative
and that's what I want to do you know I
look at like iphone and every android
phone we've put them out here on the
table not a lot of standing out and so I
wanted something that kind of was
remarkable that kind of stood out I'm
memorable but I also still wanted it to
be premium and so so I think you know
any one of the iconic for just like onyx
saving I don't want to be uncomfortable
in the hand I don't want to be hard to
use and I want to be robust and I still
want to find premium so so really the
the premium nature of Robin comes from
kind of reduction of detail and the kind
of just the honesty and transparency
about the design you know like the way
we do the dual front-facing speakers
there's just a soft depression the
Machine holes it's beautiful but then
all of a sudden you start to see this
repeated sir a circle motif where the
front-facing sensors just honest but I
try and hide them behind the black piece
of glass like you know what we've done
in the past or a lot of people do in the
past it's just treated very honestly you
come over the sides of the volume
buttons just very straightforward the
design and then again you see the circle
motif on the back where again the camera
and flash we to try to make the flash as
small as possible we just want
something that was simple some of them
was clean and something was modern and
so we chose the same size and all of a
sudden you start to see the kind of
stuff to see all these details come
together to create something that
actually actually has a lot of
personality well it's let's be fair with
all the circle motifs it is you it's
it's not there's no one else really
doing some people just circle in one
part but you guys have said you're the
only ones doing circle you started with
one you started with two and then
suddenly it became almost a kind of
synonymous with the Robin grab it's all
about the circles it's all about just
being is completely different as you can
be like you said it's almost like a it's
like a little naiveté or a little
playfulness on it because like if I were
to describe to you that hey you know we
designed a phone it's a box you'd be
like okay number one boring number two
kind of sounds kind of serious and so it
needed you know I needed some lightness
in the design and so that's where the
circles kind of came from they kind of
bring that kind of friendliness and
lightness to the design I mean it's it's
absolutely awesome just even the
hardware like I said did I've obviously
been quite lucky to be able to see the
the transition and the development of it
from the very early in September to even
last month when we were in London pretty
scary isn't it it's difficult for me to
say just how much it has improved but it
is massively mean if you watched our
hands on it was kind of it was there but
it was yeah we could see it was still a
while away what we've got here is
actually a phone that you said you use
it as your personal driver I know you've
got something that was together and I
actually like the fact that we've seen
you know the default apps that you guys
have got it the circle motif continues
through the UI it's almost like if you
could design this as a circle you would
wouldn't you tomato self so I don't
think so that doesn't sound very usable
I want to square a screen because that's
the type of content that I use so but no
I mean I think that I think you're
thinking is right is that you know we
just wanted something that we're kind of
all like we strike in the cord on a lot
of different places down from here down
to the packaging you know like all these
kind of conversations around the product
and the brand first of all it's easier
to do to be super honest I'd as a
startup company if you're kind of paying
attention that details there's less
noise there's less things that you're
dealing with but it's an opportunity to
kind of start from scratch on something
that's been for me that's been one of
the kind of coolest things about being a
next bit is that you know I've learned
so much just in the
the last 18 months and I've been around
for a long time so that that's been
super powerful and it's been super fun
you know like being a part of that and
by the way just one other thing when we
were looking at those early prototypes I
have to say you know I look cash like oh
we got all that nail down it's always
like a tightrope you know I love a
product of Elam I love kind of working
on this stuff but you know like even on
those early days you're never for sure
that hey we're going to get all this
stuff nailed you just have to have
confidence you've got a great team then
you just gotta drive drive drive and
kind of you know make sure that we're
held accountable because we you know
what he's gonna hold us accountable
people that are buying this phone so I
completely agree i'm like i said it
you've nailed it you actually it's like
whether there wasn't he done let's get a
review unit in your hands i agree i
think we should every do that but one of
the things that one of our users said
was we've saved four so far we've seen
the demos of the next week we've seen so
far really only been the gallery that's
been backed up to the cloud and back and
maybe spotify so you want to maybe just
show a couple of the a couple of other
apps just so you can see that it is just
he's pretty much any app on the phone is
now available to go to the cloud yeah
sure so I but would you ever go to the
screen here alright so so I think with
the way this phone is configured right
now is we basically just forced a bunch
of apps to offload and the algorithm
though for for consumers is is it's
basically a simple q and so as you start
installing apps you start taking photos
we start backing that stuff up to the
cloud but by default we do it when
you're plugged in on Wi-Fi so there's no
extra battery drain the toad data
consumption and then as you've used the
phone for six months or nine months a
simple q kind of gets developed if you
use a nap it goes to the back of the
queue if you look at a photo goes to the
back of the queue and so what bubbles up
are the things that you're the least
likely to open so for example if I come
over here and I'm like you know what I
actually have an open pandora in a while
I can just tap this now it's restoring
Pandora so what's happening is it's
pulling the app back down from the cloud
and once it gets pulled back down it'll
install it it'll hook back up their
credentials and app data which are on
the phone and once we launch that you
can see it's that dot actually shows
that it's actually doing the
installation process now once we launch
it all your radio stations will be there
so it's like it's never been removed
once it's been restored but it's just
it's great to it's a great way like you
said one of the
that got from personally for me about
the Robin was that case scenario being
at a festival or something where you're
you're struggling you've got no extra
storage you run out of space this is
what you need is something that just you
can just almost take stuff out the phone
that you don't need to make sure you
have enough space to capture those
memories without having to sit there for
hours sort through the gallery and then
have to and then have to deal with all
of that's right and by the way when you
get that message first of all you've
missed that moment it's gone and it's
never going to come back again and then
you've actually got to go delete stuff
on the fly and figure out okay I'm not
going to open that up again which app
should I can remove we don't think that
with the power the resources the cloud
you should actually have to do that you
shouldn't have to make that yes you're
going to want to clean out your phone at
some point but when you're on the flying
you're in that moment that should not be
the case completely agree so so here
pandora is actually downloaded so I'm
just gonna launch Pandora it's working
guys it's right this is just any pretty
much any app on your phone that you
don't need it's greatly it's about all
these these radio stations that's off
and run it so it's already been logged
back in just let's go away from the
Robin for a second let's just talk about
next week because we obviously professed
for time but how many devices did we get
it just took numbers Kickstarter and
pre-orders what was the total figures if
they don't know I don't remember I think
they have about 3,600 backers on
Kickstarter we're not announcing the
numbers on pre-orders but I'd have to go
back and actually get the number
actually number device i think it's
around 3500 or something like that close
devices and then the last question i
have for you is because everyone wants
to know we've got this amazing product
what's next from next bit
thanks to you knew we would offer
special smokable well look I think we
have first of all we've heard from the
community a lot of things like they like
the community asked us for a cdma skew
so we're working super hard to try to
get that they asked us to cipa to
Australia so we've added that in from a
software perspective you know we've
heard stuff like I want my photos to be
better i went battery life to be better
i want the setup of my next phone to be
easier so there's lots of things I think
that we can use the cloud to kind of
enhance each one of these areas so yeah
we've got a we've got to get this out
the door and then then we can start
focusing on some of those next those
next features by the way we have also we
do have some kind of things that we're
working on that which will come q late
q1 early q2 like support video support
so right now we do photos and apps will
add in video support pretty pretty
shortly thereafter and then also the
ability to look at your photos in on
another platform through a web browser
so we're working on we're working on
those things already awesome and yeah
well thank you very much for coming down
and giving us another look at the robin
but not just the robin that i've seen
but the robin that's the actual robin
the air actually go down people really
get I never says anything guys it's a
lot smoother and it's a lot nicer than
it was in September even in December
that I can personally say having seen
this the sheer amount of growth in the
development of this means that not only
will is a fun great as it is now but we
know that the future that you work hard
on development on product development I
really make sure that the user
experience remains premium at all the
time yeah I think that's the help right
and I will say if you don't have one
already I really like the Robin
purposely wait for my review unit stop
all right absolutely have thank you very
much Scott thanks very much Scott coil
for coming down having chat to us about
the Robin it's a really good product and
like I said you'll be able to see this
and see some of the footage with the new
version just the improvement in the
performance stay tuned to android
authority calm because we are your
source for all things android and we're
here live from CES 2016 until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
