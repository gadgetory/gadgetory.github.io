Authority we're arm techcon 2015 in
California and I've met up with nandan
from Armand and then nice to see you
pleasure to meet you Gary get into us a
bit about details a bit about what your
role is armed so I am the I manage the
entire cortex processor portfolio within
the CPU management a product group and
it's been actually a pleasure since I've
been doing this from the arm 11 days or
11 / 11 years ago now we've got this
full-fledged portfolio of cortex
processors and a couple of interesting
announcement this week and one of those
announcements was the cortex a 35
ultra-low-power a 64-bit do tell us a
bit about that absolutely so just to
give a bit of history the cortex a5 and
a7 processors that we introduced about
55 years ago were targeted at opening up
this entry level smartphone market and
they have been successful in fact over 2
billion new units have shipped anywhere
from $25 phones up two hundred fifty
dollar phones and this market is growing
rapidly and which is where I think the
cortex 835 comes in as the software
stacks start going towards the next
generation arm v88 architectures and
more and more phones get built with it
the entry level also tends to migrate
but there are two common characteristics
that they want they want the footprint
to be small and the power to be ultra
efficient and the cortex 835 delivers on
both of those it delivers more
performance substantially more
performance than the cortex a7 which is
today the benchmark processor and at the
same time is more efficient while
Philippe being able to run today is
32-bit code and 64 bit cold going into
the future and it's also quite versatile
because you can have the record core and
then you can go down to maybe a single
core and that would maybe be good for
IOT applications indeed so if you look
at it certainly it enables the next
generation of entry-level phones which
is where we think a lot of
initial interest is going to be the
footprint is such that it could be used
in a lot of other embedded applications
and it is designed so that you know even
when it's running full tilt at a
gigahertz it's still well under 100
milli watts of power but for a lot of
these other applications you mentioned
you could see configurations that only
sip about 5 milliwatts or 10 milliwatts
while be fully being able to run higher
level operating systems and higher level
applications so just to go over your
whole product range you've got the
cortex controllers at the very low end
called as m0 very very low power yes
then you up to the m7 and then we could
kind of a little jump and you get the
a35 in its smaller configurations and
then from then onwards we go right up to
the a the a 72 you've covered as the
msgs servers through sensors through to
servers indeed indeed and actually you
make a very good point everything from a
very small micro controller that last
son you know years on battery or even
energy harvested which is where the
cortex and zeros come and at the upper
end the product we launched at the tech
con last year which of the cortex m7
really changes some of the
microcontrollers at the high end and as
you say also cortex 835 is in that range
where it could run higher level
operating systems but also change the
microcontroller space or certainly the
single board computing or industrial
computing space and then be the
effectively this launch pad for the
higher end of the road map and of course
it was pretty compatible course with
your Molly graphics range of course and
you had the Molly 470 released recently
and that's also a low-energy processor
as well and of course it's big.little
compatible so it makes a very good
little core in that configuration
absolutely in fact what we talked about
earlier cortex a53 was the little this
is almost littler than the little and it
certainly changes the dynamic range of
the solutions you can offer combine that
with the Molly 470 graphics you can
think of very compact
new devices that are very very capable
of delivering very good visual interface
very good interactive performance that's
actually great well thanks very much my
name for your time it's been a pleasure
so Gary Simmons from arm techcon thanks
very much thank you Gary</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
