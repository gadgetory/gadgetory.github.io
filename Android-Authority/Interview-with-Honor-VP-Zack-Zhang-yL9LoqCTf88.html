at CS 2017 I'm here with a new friend of
ours mr. Zack Shay who's vice president
of honor USA and today we are just going
to be talking with the owner brand and
about the newly introduced device the
honor 6 x pleasure to meet with you
today sir a to meet you thank you very
much thank you so talk to us about the
honor 6 X about what you guys are doing
in the u.s. in 2017 yeah from the honor
6 x this will be the first of your eyes
we'd bring to the US market actually for
we are as a new brand which has come to
here just for one year because i still
remember with brain than the first
device on the 5x to the US market and we
don't we breathed on 08 @ august in
front san francisco and this is
certifies and also is really just for
complete a year after we launched in the
US market and for the past year i think
we make a good achievement that's new
brand just introduced to the US market
both ona five eggs and on a have a good
sales results and also is welcomed by
the consumer and also the bad media's
media's gives us a lot of reward and as
he's great pleasure for that well
congratulations on a very successful
launch in 2017 yeah and honestly we have
to say that you know we reviewed advice
you spent three weeks with it and for
its price point with the camera the
battery life and also how luxurious it
feels in the hand we're really impressed
honestly so I have to congratulate you
and your team for creating a really
great device in a very aggressive price
point thank you because ona is always
focus on those put we were mentioned
like that have a very nice camera
especially the do camera technology well
bring to the to the world for the dual
camera from the owner 6 plus it's very
long time ago about four to five years
already we're actually the first one to
bring a parallel by oli camera to the
world and the way already also focus on
this technology so you see that up from
18 on a 6x we all bring that dude
camera to the US market is really great
especially for the young people they can
use this one to make a lot of different
tricks yeah to make it a blue effect I
know also this is why we think is so
important to bring this technology to a
more affordable price so because the
young people they are more really to
using this kind of thing to make tricks
this is amazing it's kind of cool and
also as you mentioned we always have a
very good battery life as this one I
think that typically use two days not a
problem is thanks for the chipset and
also the large capacity of the battery
and also the performance of this device
is also quite it's very very fast very
fast you can play nearly all the games
on the market yes there's no problem on
that yeah I mean and so that leads me
into the next segue which is I have some
good news for you and for honor Oh ready
its toll don't act surprised but anyway
we just would like to award you our best
of CES award well thank you Lisa great
it's a this is an industry that's so
highly competitive you know yeah and i
think that like you said before we're
gonna see a lot of brands really
struggle 2017 yes and that's because i
believe that a lot of them have been on
a path of stagnation and they've kind of
refused to to really look forward and
innovate and that's not to say there
aren't good manufacturers because there
are a lot of amazing manufacturers an
amazing products out there right now it
just so happens that you guys are being
very aggressive in the market and so
that leads me to the next question is
about the brand defining the brand you
know talked about for the brave you know
yes and I love all these slogans yeah
don't learn nothing and everything it's
just a very playful so your talk about
young people and yes you guys want to be
different you want to be kind of fresh
you know and yes yes yes how do you plan
to do that how do you plan to let
consumers know firstly we launched our
owner as a brand for the digital natives
for a young people so we use our slogan
to be photo brave and our self is also
say that a pillow
hero to be brave as a loose daughter in
the US market will also add performance
like a challenge to do everything may be
possible to between the market and try
everything so it's also our self is also
represent the the spirit bread spread
yourself full of pride and also we are
trying to really understand the young
people the young generations idea so
this is the biggest difference from us
and yarder brand we open a lot of
channel to listen to the consumers voice
especially on a social network channels
and also on the forums so we open a lot
of channel and we also to them very fast
like in the Facebook we typically will
answer all the questions by the consumer
who leave a message on the Facebook page
it's very rare not a lot of brand with
you are willing to do that you're
willing to pay attention at customers on
a granular level through social media
it's very smart we are doing a lot of
these financing and we're also really
seriously considering the consumers
advice when they give us some very good
arrives and a majority of the community
are singing that is right away we will
try to adapt that on our device
especially on the software part and the
less while when we begin our beta test
with honor 8 on the image you I 5.0 and
also the android market there's a is
really welcomed by the consumer they
joined that quite closely with us with
about a lot of policy to us we are also
trying to adapt that to the new
upgrading
emotional I abortions it just coming
soon yeah well yeah I mean you're a new
brand you know I know you already
enjoyed a lot of success in China and
Europe and the US is a it's a very hard
market to break into yeah but I think
that you guys have a lot of the right
components to have very successful 2017
as evidenced by this beautiful device
yes I mean yeah I would look I'm looking
for you oh that's okay I mean it's so
funny you know I observed my little
cousins and stuff you know the 15 16 yes
and the way they use the device is
they're just so hard on it you know they
all have power banks you know yeah yeah
from our testing the battery likes like
you say can last almost two days you
know yeah 3340 MLM battery yeah i mean
everything in containing this it's kind
of remarkable to think the phone like
this less than a year ago be over five
hundred dollars yes you know he paints
in the market look don't half of that so
yeah yeah it's really exciting time to
be in this industry and i'm really
looking forward to working with you guys
and see what we can do together so yeah
it's like i said before you know with a
lot of manufacturers they kind of dissed
stagnate a little bit you know they
refuse to innovate and look at things
fresh you know and look what happened to
samsung in 2016 you know go through a PR
nightmare and now they're they lost 17
billion dollars a market a year because
they kind of got stale you know so
that's why it's really exciting to see a
manufacturer like you you know try to
make a new brand and have this
commitment towards young people because
young people of the future and use
devices a lot differently than yeah our
generation you know the world yeah and
also what you mentioned is very correct
and the the mass is smartphone industry
is quite dynamic and the windage if you
really want to survive and
to win the market the colony is always
most important single yeah we are like
George mentioned on a keynote of the
owner 6x when we introduce a battery we
use at least six months to introduce
just a battery so it's a very long time
don't hear it you sure that the better
we have no problem and for all the owner
device will before we launch well using
ten thousand unit just to do the test
what up the test we'll just just buried
and will not to sell it again so it's a
huge in West was a lot of lot easier
he's kind of scene together can ensure
that old device when we are on market
there's always have good quality and a
same time as you mentioned we have a lot
of things to invest on innovation to
issue the consumer can get the best
Essenes and young people like innovation
they will actually play more tricks
should I won't bring to them that's
right absolutely well I mean we're not
that old yet but we know that the new
generation of consumers coming up 16 18
though the post Millennials yeah I mean
all things in this device are going to
really satisfy them so yeah really
excited to see what you what kind of
tricks you guys have coming up first in
2017 so yeah so beside this one at the
last year December over 2016 we also
introduced a new device the name is on a
magic yes exactly in China market the
other why is a AI based smartphone is
really I think it's the first one in the
worldwide we launched that device this
is wise we cooperated with a lot of app
company in China and share with their
data data data source together and to
to make a decision on the device to help
a passion to keep them in a really AI
health system either in the market and
it's really a great success and we get a
lot of really good feedback from the
media's consumers I was really surprised
only way don't actually came up they
automatically came out of nowhere you
know and all people on our team and in
the audience we were like a river get a
device you have to review this time so
cool yeah and I know it'll probably take
some time before it can come to the US
but yes as I mentioned this device is by
a call or cooperation with a lot of apps
company is kind of big in the u.s. we
are also trying to build that kind of
similar ecosystem in the US but they
still need a bit a long time as we just
come to the US for one year so for this
kind of a corporation was still need
some time but definitely we're trying to
bring this similar kind of work you I
see in the US market use in the future
yeah exciting you know what is a big
thank you for spending time with me
today in sac thank you thank you for
both of my pleasure my pleasure great
project for us to receive that I thanks
