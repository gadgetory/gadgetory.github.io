Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to another episode of
Android apps weekly this is episode
number 136 so let's get started an
enterprising group of developers have
found a way to port exclusive oculus
rift games to the HTC vive so far two
games have been ported and they both
seem to work rather well according to
polygon the game actually played better
on the vibe which we found interesting
you must own the oculus rift version of
the game before the vibe version will
work and we also liked that Google play
music is reportedly going to launch
their podcast platform on April
eighteenth apparently there was an
embargoed email sent to NPR which was
then linked to the general public and
any case the podcast platform will be a
welcome addition and assuming the elite
emails are correct we'll see it live on
the 18th mojang has announced that
minecraft pocket edition is going
cross-platform through an add-on to the
game called minecraft realms the idea is
to get everyone from every platform on
the same version of minecraft so we can
all play together no matter what system
we're rocking the open beta is out now
with no indication on a release date
just yet two months ago Google announced
that they're safe browsing initiative
would do away with phony download
buttons and deceptive advertising this
last week the company finally made good
on that promise and these new features
should be rolling out to just about
everyone once it's done it should be a
cold day in hell before you see another
fake download button me tomo is having a
hell of a release on mobile the
application currently sits with over 4
million downloads or about 370,000
downloads per day and makes about
280,000 dollars per week about eighty
percent of all of that as iOS users
which brings up the old debate as to
which platform is actually better for
game developers nevertheless the
application is doing amazingly well for
even more Android apps and games news
releases and updates don't forget to
check out this week's newsletter which
is linked in the video description below
there you'll find all of the information
that we didn't have time for here if
you'd like you can sign up for the
newsletter using the form which is on
the written companion which is also
linked in the video description below
and we'll send it directly to your inbox
every Sunday
right folks is take a look at the apps
and games that made a big splash this
week as usual if you want to check out
any of these apps or games you can find
those links in the video description
below HTC boost plus is a new
application from HTC that is included on
many HTC devices and surprisingly
available to pretty much everyone the
application has a few functions but its
basic premise is that it's another one
of those cleaner applications that
claims to boost performance save battery
life and clear out your storage the good
news is that it will actually clear out
your cash and junk files but the bad
news is that the rest of it is probably
just snake oil it's free so you can grab
it if you want it Aurora quarantine is a
new puzzle game where you must roll a
ball around and solve some puzzles the
game's immediate claim to fame is its
graphics which are much better than most
other puzzle games the story of the game
is that the earth is polluted and you're
essentially a non copyright infringement
version of wall-e the controls appear to
be a little glitched according to user
reviews but the developers claim that
controller supports and better on-screen
controls are on the way it's one dollar
and forty-seven cents and it has no
in-app purchases you may remember us to
as the developers that gave us the smash
hit game Monument Valley well this week
they have launched an Android wear watch
face maker aptly named face maker the
application gives you to watch faces
called classic and trio and from there
you can customize them to your
specifications there are a number of
options although if you're looking for
some hardcore editing you may need to
look elsewhere it's free with no in-app
purchases so at least there's that the
super arclight is a minimalist arcade
shooter with a ton of colors and lots of
spinning the central premise is that
you're a dot rotating around a focal
point your job is to shoot down bad guys
as they try to infiltrate the center the
controls are easy enough you press to
shoot hold the shoot more and then you
reverse course as soon as you're done
shooting it's challenging and fast-paced
and you can also unlock stuff as you go
it's a decent price and a fun little
time waster quote is a new RSS reader
which is a rarer and rarer occurrence
these days quote features a minimal
style and takes a no-nonsense approach
to RSS it has the capacity to sink to I
know reader as well as feedly and you
can manage both feeds from this
application it has the basic controls
and settings including the ability to
schedule syncing and a whole lot more if
you
pro you can get rid of ads use multiple
accounts and use more of the themes if
you're looking for a simple RSS reader
that syncs to feedly or I know reader
this is a good option and that about
does it for this video folks if you want
to keep watching we have joshs HTC 10
review linked up there on the screen as
well as the video description below if
you want to check that out also don't
