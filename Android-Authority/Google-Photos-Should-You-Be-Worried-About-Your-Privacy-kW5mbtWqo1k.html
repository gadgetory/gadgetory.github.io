brought to you by domain.com Google
photos
is it just a great new service that
uploads all your photos and videos for
free or is it a maniacal ploy to deprive
you of your privacy and steal your data
maybe a little phone so what is Google
photos and what is it not the service
allows you to automatically upload all
your photos and videos to the cloud for
free and without a limit on storage with
a couple of limitations photos cannot be
bigger than 16 megapixels they'll be
automatically downscaled if they are and
videos must be 1080p resolution or lower
Google photos is available as an app on
Android and iOS or you can use it
through your web browser and provides
you with a single location for all your
photos that's accessible from all your
devices there are a lot of services
trying to solve the same problem but
Google photos has some major advantages
over the competition it's free unlimited
and really good at organizing your
photos making them searchable and
curating them that means you can search
by location by date by event or by using
a variety of keywords for example type
beach into the search box and you'll see
all your photos with a beach in them the
photos assistant also creates highlight
videos and gifts for you to share taking
the pain out of editing things together
by yourself this isn't a new idea but as
with so many things Google is a little
better at doing it than most of the
competition now you've probably heard
the adage if you are not paying for the
product then you are the product and
this is true in the case here
yes Google is an advertising company
that's how they make most of their money
but more specifically they are a search
advertising company and that means that
to be effective they need to know as
much about you their searcher as
possible so that they can deliver to you
relevant ads and Google is exceptionally
good at doing that I can't remember a
time in the past two years where I've
done a search and I haven't gotten
relevant ads I mean ads that I actually
care about and for Google to do that
they need to know as much about you as
possible so they give us these great
free products I mean who gives you
better free products that
Google but they come at a price they
take our data and they use it to
advertise to us
so Simon Hill who is the author of this
article will tell you that it really
comes down to whether or not we trust
Google with our data Google is going to
know where you took these photos who you
took these photos with and what you were
doing in those photos do you trust
Google to do whatever they want with
this data because the legalese says that
they basically can do whatever they want
with those photos so do you trust them a
product like Google photos falls under
the Google's Terms of Service that means
that when you upload your photos you are
having the tech giant license to host
store reproduce modify create derivative
works communicate publish publicly
perform publicly display and distribute
those photos there you go Google
believes that they can basically do
anything they want
with these photos now I don't think the
question is do you trust to Google the
only real answer to that is you can
trust Google to be a for-profit
corporation if they can get away with it
legally and from a public PR perspective
they're going to do it the question is
are we web savvy enough are we just
privacy savvy enough to be conscious
about what we put online I'm going
camping in a couple weeks with my family
I don't think there's anything that you
know I would post or upload to my
private file that if were hacked
I wouldn't want distribute or I wouldn't
be able to accept being distributed but
let's be clear there are photos that I
would not want to be shared publicly so
I am NOT going to risk putting them in
my Google Drive account which could be
mistakenly in this place or copied by
someone else
or I could get hacked so I'm just not
going to upload those I'm going to share
those very very privately and just be
conscious and careful about those things
this idea that you can not use Google
photos and that's somehow going to
protect your privacy is you know be
lying the fact that if you're using any
Google products they also know a lot
about you already so just a reminder I'm
still looking for the very best Android

matters why because no domain name
