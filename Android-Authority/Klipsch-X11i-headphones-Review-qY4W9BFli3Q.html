just one of those companies that you
have to mention from the home theater
setup to their mobile audio clips is
just a company that just makes great
audio products so today let's see if the
tradition stands strong with the x11 eye
earbud the clips x11 eye earbuds are
said to be one of the smallest and
lightest headphones clips also states
that is one of their finest achievements
and headphones today and let's see if
they can really back up these statements
the box that it comes in is a really no
frills type of packaging the top is a
plastic housing that has the earbuds in
it and the bottom portion holds the
accessories these earbuds come in the
apat inant clips leather carrying case
and it also comes with the clothing clip
airplane adapter 1/4 inch adapter and
also five types and sizes of tips if
you'd like to see a full unboxing and
first impressions please visit the link
in the description below the earbuds are
aluminum and rubber there are only about
two inches long and they also have a
slight bend to the design the aluminum
casing is slick subtle and yet
forgettable they sort of blend in and
attempt to have you focus on the music
instead of the design these earbuds are
an inner style and they rely on finding
the right tip to ensure a perfect fit
the headphones sit within your ear and
does not use any other type of support
to hold them in the chord is made from
reinforced Kevlar and compared to other
earbuds in this price range they seem a
bit thin
although thinness does not determine the
durability but I'll be cautious to not
get them caught on anything or have a
snag the cords possess a three-button
audio controller plus mic and as you'd
expect the three buttons allow for
volume control and a play/pause and skip
button also as expected these controls
work on Apple products but with Android
the volume does not work if use draw
back from the x11 eyes is that the cord
is not removable a lot of earbuds and
headphones are now coming with a
detachable core this is huge for a
number of things along for easy
transportation and most importantly
prevent snags though rip your cord from
the air but I've lost many headphones
because the cord gets stuck under my
chair and this seems like a big omission
from clip
especially at this price range if the
headphones no longer work they do
provide a two-year warranty that will
cover most issues the microphone with
the ear buds at first glance seems to be
a bit low on the cord but after taking a
few phone calls in a quiet room a lot of
callers were able to hear me with little
issues as with almost any microphone on
a headset it does not do a great job at
blocking out ambient sound but
attempting to make a call or answer a
call in a noisy room using the headset
would not render any sort of result that
you'd hope to expect the x11 eyes come
with five styles of tips for your ear
each tip is shaped differently and
they're all different sizes too so you
can find the right size that works best
for you although there isn't a clip or
anything to make them stay in your ear
it does a great job with just sticking
in there somehow these headphones are
light enough to comfortably walk around
with and after a few minutes you'd
honestly forget they're in your ear I
could comfortably wear these headphones
for several hours at my desk also out
and about without having any noticeable
amounts of discomfort and this is a
Testament on well design and the
weightless feel these headphones on the
performance side of things clips provide
an impressive spec sheet with the
frequency response between 5 Hertz and
19 kilo Hertz the sensitivity comes in
at 110 DB impedance comes in at an
impressive 50 ohms the headphones use a
full range armature driver which is
impressive to see in such a small
form-factor the noise isolation is
negative 26 DB and these only weigh a
mere 10 grams which is only three tenths
of an ounce if you need further
explanation on these definitions I'll
provide a link in the description that
should help you out a little better
although specs are nice to look at
what's more important is to see if they
pass the ear test as expected from
looking at the spec sheet we see an
impressive range to put this to the test
I played a variety of songs that have
different ranges the overall sound is
balanced the highs mids lows all combine
to make an even sound without adjusting
EQ the sound seems to be right and it
passes the initial ear test there's not
one part of the song that stands out
like other audio equipment now this
could be the full range armature driver
doing this job I wish I could say there
was nothing wrong with the x11 eye here
but I really do but there is a problem
and it could be a big deal for you it
has a lot of wire noise so if you touch
the wire over rubs against your shirt or
your skin it will end up in your ear and
that could cause a problem it could ruin
the song for you if you're that
particular about your music not a huge
deal for me but it may be huge deal for
you the price of these earbuds are $349
but can be found as low as $239 as
always it depends on how serious you are
about music and how much comfort means
to you these earbuds are expensive yes
but they provide a great balance sound
lightweight bill and comfortable fit
and this concludes the x11 I air buds
