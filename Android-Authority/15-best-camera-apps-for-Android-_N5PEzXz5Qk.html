handy the Android authority app guide in
this quick video we're going to take a
look at the best camera apps for Android
first up is camera MX and it's a fairly
basic camera replacement app it comes
with a variety of filters and some
cursory controls here and there it's not
great for professional use but it is not
bad overall camera zoom FX is a lot like
camera MX in terms of features except
that you can create your own filters
also like MX it's not great for
professional use but good enough for
regular people camera 360 ultimate has
been around for a long time it has the
standard stuff like filters but also
some unique stuff like facial
recognition photo editing tools and it's
one of the few that is free with no ads
camera fun Pro is a camera application
that focuses on more goofy and unusual
filters like pinch lens x-ray and other
types of filters you can also see how
pictures look before snapping the actual
picture camera jb+ is based on the stock
Android camera from jelly bean and
there's one for KitKat as well it's the
stock Android camera experience from
back before Google camera existed and
for many it works Samara is a wildly
popular camera application that focuses
on face shots that includes facial
recognition smoothing and other kinds of
effects to make selfies and portraits
look better DSLR cameras claim to famous
that it tries to emulate DSLR features
as much as possible does she'll be able
to adjust things like ISO white balance
and other settings but only if your
hardware supports it jiff camera does
pretty much what the name says it does
the camera takes 10 to 15 seconds a
video and morphs it into gifs that you
can share you can even adjust settings
like frame rate if you want Google
camera is the new stock camera
application that comes on Nexus devices
and it's fairly competent it doesn't
have a lot of features but it does allow
for some fun things like Lens Blur and
panorama HD camera ultimate is about a
mid way for camera apps it has some
settings like white balance but it also
has some more mainstream stuff like
filters you can even disable the shutter
sounds if you want line camera is
another filter style camera with 20
filters frame stamps and other additions
there is also a set of basic editing
tools at your disposal should you need
them it's also wildly popular open
camera is a great option if you happen
to be a fan of F OSS this open-source
camera app lets you change things like
ISO white balance and exposure lock if
your phone supports it and it's also
totally free otaku camera is a goofy
camera application for fans of anime and
manga it turns every picture
the kind of drawing style you see in
manga comics and you can even add images
and stamps to complete the effect paper
camera was huge a few years ago but it's
cooled off considerably still this
camera does one thing and that's take
pictures and make them look like
hand-drawn doodles and it does that
better than pretty much everyone else
snap camera HDR is a feature-rich camera
application with some interesting
touchscreen controls some of the
features include HDR the ability to
choose your video formats and there's
even a photo editor if you need one and
that about does it for this video folks
this video probably won't be getting
updated again for a very long time but
the article will most certainly be
updated frequently so make sure to come
back to the written version every now
