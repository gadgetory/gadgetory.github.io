look at the best camera apps for Android
first up is camera MX and it's a fairly
basic camera replacement app it comes
with a variety of filters and some
cursory controls here and there it's not
great for professional use but it is not
bad overall camera zoom FX is a lot like
camera MX in terms of features except
that you can create your own filters
also like MX it's not great for
professional use but good enough for
regular people camera 360 ultimate has
been around for a long time it has the
standard stuff like filters but also
some unique stuff like facial
recognition photo editing tools and it's
one of the few that is free with no ads

mid way for camera apps it has some
settings like white balance but it also

filters frame stamps and other additions

your phone supports it and it's also
totally free otaku camera is a goofy
camera application for fans of anime and
manga it turns every picture
the kind of drawing style you see in

and stamps to complete the effect paper

better than pretty much everyone else

application with some interesting
touchscreen controls some of the
