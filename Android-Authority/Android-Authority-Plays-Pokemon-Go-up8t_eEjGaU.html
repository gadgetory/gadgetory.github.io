road playing pokemon right yeah ok so I
am currently driving a vehicle but my
lovely girlfriend / assistant for this
video is going to be holding the phone
and catching the pokemon and all of that
jazz while I'm behind the wheel and I
will take over once i have stopped the
car so but i'm going to be running
around los angeles today trying to find
stuff for pokemon go now there's a gym
right over there huggy stops here so i'm
going to start off with those but the
Polka stops are some really nice areas
some cool murals and little nice thing
so it might be a slightly educational
Trek for us there you go get some
 balls pokey stop um we're going
to turn around and get this poky stop
cuz there's hole behind me that's fine I
keep doing it oh I still got it haha
swiggity swooty give me that booty haha
uh no pokemon appearing yet I need a
problem here or something I maybe pop
some incense something my phrase for
that and now there's this guy standing
outside a restaurant staring at me
because I'm wearing a headset see Brett
the Griffith Observatory right now
you'll see wonderful views of LA see we
can go and catch this I guess
oh yeah I caught a Spearow 486 thing is
I don't get to play a whole lot so I
actually don't have super strong Pokemon
this is the one terrible part about
driving while playing is that like if I
catch anything I'm not really going to
know about it well griffith observatory
turned out to be a bit of a dud there
was that one lure that was good I got a
few Pokemon there but this place is just
crawling with dinner and that's right
sweetie no it's not that's staying in
the video is staying in the videos that
you can do about it now let's get some
supplies
if only it would load
just a frustrating thing about this game
it's just not all that reliable because
this is like you know not a great part
of town we got like a thousand dollars
where the phones flashing in the window
along with a seventy dollar xbox headset
used to record this let's go dry it back
over to the nice part of town a thingy
with wingies oh my god you don't listen
to our podcast do you let's get to catch
it staple center over there the cute
ones either metal streets what let this
happen oh we have a mouth I haven't
caught one of those yet Oh give that
some raspberries raspberries come on
Meowth I am your daddy now all right now
we're in downtown LA I'm going up there
that's the new sky space in LA and
pokemon are already up there
oh right horns over here but look up
there anyway
what I can't believe I'm 29 years old
never been stuck behind a public bus
before all right so hit the children in
the parking lot just kidding just
kidding viewers don't hit children it is
a horrible horrible idea how's my egg
door 2.5
I've only walked 2.5 kilometers today
and according to my pebble I have walked
five thousand seven hundred steps wow
how many poking water in that little
area all right so I'm gonna be catching
this one alright so before be so we're
gonna this up all right let's catch a
pokemons getting the ball Oh fu getting
the ball this is not as easy as it looks
ok so getting the pokeball there we go
wiggle once wake up twice wiggle through
oh no oh I can almost evolve Ekans ok I
could do that today might be one of the
last things I do yes when we reckons
it's gonna be awesome all right here we
go I got so many of them all right so my
strongest one is 134 and we
evolve him wow that's cool
yeah oh it's starting to rain it's a
good thing I'm not driving and playing
at the same time by the way so this is
how we have it set up we have a dual
Qualcomm quick charge 2.0 tower in the
car and whenever I go driving around
looking for Pokemon I always take my
wonderful girlfriend with me and she
controls both of our phones while I keep
my eyes on the road that is how you
should do it if you have to drive and
catch poking up sorry that was my
windshield wipers if you have to drive
and catch pokemon that is the way that
is the official android authority
recommended way of doing so Oh half an
hour I can do twice as much experience
3000 experience I mean it didn't really
make me a level up or anything what's
nice to get that so I'm going to take
yes as as maybe she is still with me
alright 922 I can take this hello
internet and that is my friend Eric he
is a giant douche perfect for team valor
alright so there goes my jolteon it's
going down but next up is my vaporeon
who is a far superior Pokemon you're
going down hypno Shadow Ball what the
hell out her mind doesn't hurt at all
yeah you're going down here to you
oh sorry Josh you're gonna have to bleep
that none out ah I like this area let's
see how powerful the jimmies 521 12 oh
wait I swear the Orca nines I'm telling
you all right what am i laying down
