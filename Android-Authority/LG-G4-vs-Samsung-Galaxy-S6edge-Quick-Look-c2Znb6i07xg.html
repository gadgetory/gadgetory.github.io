quick look at the LG g4 versus the
Samsung Galaxy s6 and edge it is
important to note right off the bat that
we have different versions for both of
these devices the LG g4 does come with
the new leather backing however we got
our time with the titanium finish
plastic version mostly and in the
Samsung camp we have the galaxy s6 edge
now the LG g4 combines the best design
features of previous flagship offerings
with the device sporting a slightly
curved display more subtle than compared
to the G flex 2 but still retains the
most recognisable aspect of an LG
smartphone the rear button layout with
an easy reach of the index finger
Samsung's latest flagship offerings
brought with them a major upheaval to
the build and the quality with its glass
and metal body while the more unique
galaxy s6 edge that you're seeing here
boasts two curved edges that not only
enhances the look but serves a little
bit of a purposes while mainly in organ
a'm --ax there's no mistaking it for
anything but a Samsung device though
with the signature elements like the
physical home button up front and the
standard replacements of the volume
rocker and the power button available
obviously the main story between these
two devices as many are going to be
talking about is that the galaxy s6 and
the edge have compromises with the
unibody design resulting in a lack of
features like the removable battery and
the SD card expansion that isn't the
case with the LG g4 though because no
matter what version of the phone you get
whether it's one of the few plastic
built or one of the many colors of the
leather backing all of the vacuums are
removable so you get access to these
particular features now speaking of back
covers the LG g4 brings a slew of
options to the table a leather material
in a variety of colors with even more
coming in the summer and even though the
stitching in the middle might be a
little bit showy to us we did think that
the leather backing provides the phone a
very nice feel and the grip is even
better on it compared to the plastic
version in displays quad HD is the name
of the game now as Samsung's well known
display prowess in the 5.1 Super AMOLED
display of the s6 edge has the
resolution bumped up to the current
flagship standard so bramlett brings all
of the deep blacks and the vivid colors
that we all love and brightness and
viewing angles are pretty fantastic and
the two edges on the side can be used
one or the
other in order to provide the edge
features though the night clock is
probably our favorite feature of these
particular capabilities the g4 on the
other hand is packin a 5.5 inch IPS
display now IPS constructions have
already been well-regarded by LG however
LG is attacking the Super AMOLED
ecosystem by bringing in the DCI
standard for those of you that don't
know the DCI standard involves
television and cinema and is one of the
ways of really engaging the quality of a
display this time around the g4 has a
quantum display that uses a specific
type of construction on it in order to
achieve the coloration that is under the
DCI standard while Samsung and their
Super AMOLED displays might go over this
particular percentage the g4 will hit 98
percent of that mark and this is a
standard that LG is going for it's worth
mentioning that it is a curved display
on the g4 but it is not the significant
curve that came with the G flex 2
however despite losing that immersive
effect you will still get some of the
durability that was afforded the Flex
line in terms of performance
optimization is obviously the name of
the game as the g4 packs a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 808 processor in a very close
relationship with Qualcomm so that the
processor is as optimized as possible
for the g4 s needs along with three
gigabytes of RAM to help with
multitasking so far the performance on
the g4 has been as smooth as expected in
our short time with it there were no
noticeable hiccups now this is in
contrast to Samsung's decision to skip
the snapdragons of the world and make an
in-house Exynos processor that is also
as optimized as possible for samsung's
user interface now with both phones
we're probably going to see a very close
race when it comes to performance and
we're looking forward to seeing if the
LG g4 can keep up because we didn't have
the greatest time with the G flex 2
however that doesn't seem to be the case
with the g4 thus far
hardware obviously takes on a very
different look here as the g4 is one of
the few flagships available in Android
this year that does come with the
features that Samsung used to put in
every phone obviously with Samsung's
unibody glass and metal design you don't
get removable batteries or expandable
storage but the g4 no matter what
backing you get affords you these
abilities because every single backing
is removable as you can see here
however one of the glaring omissions in
the LG g4 is of course a fingerprint
reader which is found in the Samsung
iteration in the home button you simply
have to press down on the power button
and you'll be able to scan your
fingerprint and there's also the heart
rate sensor on the back of the samsung
galaxy s6 and edge which can be used
from time to time does come a little bit
handy but is not something you'll find
on the LG g4 now the galaxy s6 edge does
come with a 2600 milliamp hour
non-removable battery that proved to
provide battery life at just about
average - a little bit above average
performance LG hopes to come in with a
larger 3000 milliamp hour unit that can
give up to 20 hours of talktime and they
will be marketing very heavily the fact
that you can replace the battery and
have spares if you need them we make it
over to camera and it is a case of one
upping the other as the LG g4 comes with
AF 1.8 aperture lens compared to the F
1.9 camera that's found in the samsung
galaxy ecosystem now the LG g4 also
comes with a somewhat larger sensor than
many of the others found in flagships
and even better oh is that has a wider
spectrum it also comes with a what is
called a color spectrum sensor which
will analyze a scene in order to more
accurately provide the white balance but
speaking of white balance we do need to
talk about the manual modes between
these two phones the Samsung Galaxy s6
edge does come with a good manual mode
that allows for a lot of catering of
these of these settings however LG
apparently spoke to a lot of
photographers and ask them what features
they want to see in the camera app and
it looks like you're going to get all
the different features that are usually
afforded regular cameras including a
full white balance gamut manual focus a
lot of ISO stops even a histogram and
probably most exciting to us the ability
to capture raw and JPEG at the same time
however you are going to need that
expandable storage to hold all of those
raw photos now we are going to put both
of these phones through their paces and
the camera shootout so stay tuned for
that when we get our review unit of the
LG g4 and in software we are of course
looking at two iterations of Android
that as being heavily marketed it has
been very optimized for the processing
package
especially in the case of Samsung with
their in-house Exynos processor we did
have a very good time with its iteration
of TouchWiz that has been stripped down
from many of the different features that
cluttered it in the past
the LG g4 doesn't exactly get afforded
that kind of stripping down experience
however it does feel a lot snappier than
it did on the G flex 2 when we reviewed
it now that being said there are a
couple of enhancements baked into the
GUI this time around including an
enhanced calendar application that can
save from pretty much any part of the
phone to your dates and a more robust
gallery app we are going to look at the
software more closely in our full review
but we will say that it looks like these
two are going to be a little bit more
neck-and-neck this time around
especially what the optimizations LG put
in in association with qualcomm and so
there you have it just as quick look
riffing about the differences in this
versus between the Samsung Galaxy s6 and
edge versus the LG g4 there are
different versions of either device and
you will have your pick of the two
however we will say that the two Korean
giants seem to be as neck-and-neck as
ever this time around and we will prove
that in our full review so make sure you
stay tuned for all of that and even more
from us here in New York City for the LG
g4 watch event</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
