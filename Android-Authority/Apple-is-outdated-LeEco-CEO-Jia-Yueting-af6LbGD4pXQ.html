that Apple is outdated because get this
Apple is too focused on individual apps
mr. yu ting the 43 year old CEO of
China's Lego conglomerate was recently
interviewed by CNBC and he had a lot of
bold statements to offer and I quote one
of the most important reasons for
slowing sales is that Apple's innovation
has become extremely slow for example
over a month ago Apple launched the
iPhone se from an industry insiders
perspective this product had very low
level of technology we're thinking it's
something they just shouldn't have done
well it's always good business for any
CEO that's competing with Apple to
announce to the world how they are
different and what they can do better
but the premise of his argument is
faulty here's the thing Apple is not
looking at this issue from a
technologists perspective they are
looking at it from a business
perspective and because they are so
dominant they can get away with milking
the value and revenue from every little
bit of innovation that they have you see
from a business perspective Apple wants
to make as much money as possible from
the least amount of work you see they
knew that 60% of their iPhone 5s users
did not upgrade to the iPhone 6
indicating that they really liked
smaller phones so all Apple had to do
who is to create a phone that was very
similar powered to the iPhone 6 but look
like the iPhone 5s boom they don't have
to do something super creative and
innovative to make gobs of money and
they did it now we know what you're
thinking you're thinking Jase yeah but
the sales of this new smaller iPhone
didn't do that great but that's okay
because Apple is totally dominant they
can push the boundaries and see when the
market will push back so we expect the
next new iteration of the iPhone will be
something different something new Apple
can afford to do that but here's where
Lego CEO says something very fascinating
and I quote Apple only has individual
apps this was the right choice for the
first generation of the mobile net where
CPUs and the mobile network speeds
weren't fast enough however we're now
moving into the next era of the mobile
Internet these problems no longer exist
moreover having separate apps just means
greater obstacles to the user experience
we hope to break down these obstacles so
what exactly is he talking about well
you can imagine that instead of having
to go to one app to text your friend and
another app to check your email and
another app to check the weather you
could do that all on one page through
voice dictation and thumb swiping that
is interesting that's fascinating and
that is something that Apple has failed
to do to date so what do you think of
this CEOs claims let me know in the
comments below I will be reading them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
