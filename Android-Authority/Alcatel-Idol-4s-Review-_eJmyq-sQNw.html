they released the OneTouch Idol 3 the
5.5 inch version that is the phone was
one of many budget-friendly mid ranges
we saw throughout the year but it
remained relevant because of its solid
performance and $250.00 starting costs
well they're not backing down this year
either with its successor there's been a
lot of heated competition in this
mid-range category and we've seen a
handful of offerings already so it's
going to need a lot to stay in the thick
of things as we enter the second half of
the year hey guys John be here with
Android thority and this is a review of
the Alcatel idol 4s
I'm very successful 2015 Alcatel sem
Bishan to move forward is seen here at
the phone it's beautifully designed and
far more premium nature than last year's
product thanks to its glass meets barrel
construction you can see it's somewhat
similar to what Samsung has done with
its phones but the idol 4s isn't as
refined it doesn't have the cohesiveness
that we get from Samsung stuff but it's
still beautifully designed like for
example there's a small lip you don't
really see it but you definitely feel it
around the display or what kind of meets
the metal trim vessel and it does give
the phone just a little bit of a sharper
feel it's not obtrusive or impedes the
way you use the phone but it just
doesn't have that uniformity that we get
from Samsung's designs it features some
interesting design choices for starters
they surprised everyone by fashioning a
fingerprint sensor on the back which
wasn't something we saw back during
Mobile World Congress
the only issue though relates to how its
plush with the surrounding area so I'm
sometimes finding myself fiddling around
just to find it well it's not much of an
issue when you have the included case on
just because the placement is a little
bit more distinguishable secondly it
packs dual three point six one JBL
certified speakers that deliver
impressive audio they're powerful and
sound clean so we're impressed you'll
also notice that there are two grilles
on the back as well that helps and
disperse in the audio to cover a wider
range than those typically that are just
five towards the front they're so
powerful that they even have enough
substance in the noisiest conditions
take a listen for yourself
and lastly there's the boom key which is
essentially a shortcut button on its
side it's tiny and it's also rather
stiff but to be frank its placement is
more appropriate for a power button we
now have quad HD resolution with this
5.5 inch display
they've also switched to AMOLED as well
it displays actually the second most
attractive thing of the phone it's
bright at over 600 nits and it has all
the qualities of AMOLED
however the screens on the colder side
with its 7500 Kelvin color temperature
and it tends to produce oversaturated
unrealistic colors that's not a bad
thing but it's not accurate or true life
either but of course all this can be
modified to your liking just because you
can manually set the color temperature
through the display settings for either
a warmer or colder tone at the same time
- we notice that the screen isn't as
responsive as we'd like when it comes to
swipes you really have to give a firm
touch in order for it to register it
could be latency issue of some kind but
it simply means that you can't relays if
you're swipes either like pulling down
the notifications bar can be a hit or
miss type thing depending on how firmly
you swipe down when the area is where
it's going to be scrutinized a lot is in
its processing performance it comes
equipped with a Snapdragon 650 to chip
with three gigabytes of RAM which is
more than plans to handle the easy stuff
when it comes to other things like
gaming it's something you might see
hiccupping every now and then for the
average user they'll probably be content
with its performance but for those who
are more demanding its weaker processing
performance compared to today's
flagships limits its ability to do more
Oh at the very least
Alcatel is generous and giving it 32
gigabytes of internal storage with
expansion via microsd Alka tells Android
experience is likable one at the very
least since it tries it's best to remain
faithful to the stock experience basic
users will appreciate its simplicity and
straightforwardness but power users will
be craving for more it's more like a one
step process with the experience here on
the idle 4s just because your focus on
doing one thing at a time whereas say
something like TouchWiz you have all
these features and functions at your
disposal
they do however continue to offer all
hotels reversible mode while some might
is a novelty it doesn't have any
negative implications to the experience
hey it just means that you don't have to
worry about picking up the phone because
regardless if you pick it upside down
the interface will adapt the question
that remains though is if it'll get the
next version of Android in a timely
manner
this year's camera gets bumped up to 16
megapixels and uses a Sony sensor while
the front one is still at 8 megapixels
but receives a wider earth 2.0 aperture
lens for the most part the camera gets
the job done so we can't complain
details are sufficient and colors tend
to be rich in tone however it struggles
with dynamic range as brighter lit areas
tend to be overexposed that's all by
using HDR which adjusts the exposure
throughout the range but then it appears
a bit artificial and there's no
automatic HDR mode either its weakest
area continues to be low-light since
images tend to be grainy and more
susceptible to blurring the front camera
works rather well producing enough
details and color to the mix 4k video
capture is offered with a camera as well
it's a delightful option for those who
need the extra resolution to work with
and just like it's still shot
performance video quality's in the same
range it's good when the conditions are
ideal but isn't one for low-light
situations on top of that the electronic
image stabilization doesn't seem to do
much as well since shakiness is still
apparent as for the camera app itself
you have all the staple modes like
panoramic HDR and slow-motion you also
have added treats like micro video which
is an editing feature for short clips as
well as fuse that adds a parallax esque
like effect to give them just a more
interactive look they're all neat but we
really wish that the manual mode also
worked for video nope it's only good for
photos call quality is surprisingly
great with this one the volume output is
pretty strong through the earpiece and
also on the speakerphone but it's made
better with the clear tones of its
quality voices have strong emphasis
which makes it even a breeze to chitchat
when there's some ambient noise around
we're also impressed by its better than
average battery life which is attributed
to the 3000 milliamp hour battery in
general we're able to get easy
1/2 days of normal usage out of it now
that'll vary depending on the user but
even if you're the demanding
type its charging time is that a speedy
89 minutes and that box is what we call
quick charging so while it doesn't claim
that title of being the best of the best
when it comes to battery life it's still
an apart to what we see with all the
other five ships out there Alcatel isn't
just selling a phone here instead
they're selling an experience because
when you buy it
it'll be bundled with a VR headset so
out of the box literally you can
experience VR that's a sweet gesture
made better by the fact that they're
also including a pair of JBL headphones
a screen protector and incipio case all
this is awesome to include the purchase
especially when this unlock dual sim
smartphone is only four hundred dollars
when it launches on August third yes if
you preorder it beforehand you'll get an
additional discount to drop it down to
only $350 but it's still competing with
some other aggressively priced smart
phones at around the same cost phones
like the one plus three and the ZTE axon
seven come to mind at the foreign dollar
mark but then you also have even cheaper
things like the $250 motor g4 plus to
think about while it'll see a price
reduction sometime the future here now
it's playing to a tough audience that
has a lot to choose from
last year starting price of $250 was
undeniably head-turning with OneTouch
Idol 3 but now at $400 with the idol s
it's tougher to like that's unless its
design and batch of goodies are enough
to seduce you everything about the phone
is an upgrade from last year from the
design to the specs I definitely like it
but at $400 it really causes you to
think more about what you want to buy so
