authority my name is Gerald Doak and
this is our review for office suite pro
version 5 this is the updated version
that has a tablet optimized user
interface and so they've done a really
good job of taking advantage of the 10
inch screen that tablets generally have
however it does have a pretty unified
user interface even in comparison to the
phones that you can load this on I've
used this down all the way down to a
QVGA resolution on a samsung intercept
and really every bit of the content
creation is still there except for you
have a limitation on screen size where I
really think they did a great job of
making a full-featured content creation
office suite right here from the main
menu the very beginning of opening the
application you're met with this file
manager system that really is
reminiscent of the My Documents area in
Windows and so here on the left you have
your recent files these are all the
recent files that you've opened as you
may notice on here there is zips and
PDFs also included in with the Word
Excel and PowerPoint documents and
that's because office suite is able to
extract as well as create zip files and
it also can render PDFs what's really
interesting about the PDFs in here is
that it actually works better than
Adobe's own PDF open Reader program it
runs smoother it renders better and I
was really surprised that they were able
to best Adobe and you know just
something as simple as PDF viewing and
it was really really nice and I've
enjoyed that aspect of of office suite
then the next one down on the list is
your My Documents area My Documents is
really an area that you're able to
customize if you go into the settings
area here and select the My Documents
folder it normally is defaulting to the
Downloads area of your SD card or this
one I was it around to defaulting to my
documents area in my SD card one of the
things that I did find kind of funny was
upon setting that I'd hit My Documents
here and it always returned me down
the Downloads area what I didn't realize
is all I had to do was reset my tablet
and then there My Documents area now
properly takes me to whichever area I
had set it to so then that solved itself
really quick no problem
so you're in the local files you're able
to browse any of the directories that
are on your SD card or your internal
memory do note that as you go fear
through like the My Documents area it is
only able to show you the files that
it's able to actually handle so Word
Excel PowerPoint zip files and PDFs are
generally all you're gonna see here so
you can't use this file manager area to
install apks or anything like that
however you can cut and paste and copy
all the the file formats that office
suite is able to manipulate you're
actually able to cut and paste them to
different areas of the SD card using
this file manager system so it does work
pretty nice there is also the remote
files area so you're able to sync up any
of your Google Documents accounts to be
able to save to the cloud or you know
load those any documents you have in
your Google Documents area so here in
the My Documents area I have some you
know example files set up here here is a
word document or I have some bullet
points here you do you can see that that
bold the bolding does work italics and
underline right and left justification
as well as um being able to highlight
any words as well as changing the colors
of your lettering and so there's that
over in here one of my favorite things
in office suite and actually it is
something that that they have perfected
in here which I've not seen in any of
the manufacturers you know renditions of
Android is your salty content your text
selection here this is super smooth and
it is actually very hard not to get
exactly what you were intending to grab
you know I've seen a lot of different
Android versions of whether it's
motoblur or TouchWiz and things like
that that they just couldn't pull it off
as well as this and I really have to you
know commend them in how well you're
able to select text here in this mint
using this interface from here you're
able to cut copy and paste any of the
text you select also here in view you
can sip to the top and go to the zip to
the bottom
zoom you know do fullscreen and things
like that as well as change the
formatting of you know your double
spacing or your paragraph formatting you
can insert pictures into your document
files here you can even sit here and do
a word count it'll just tell you you
know how many characters and how many
words you have in your document so that
is the word err the word document area
you're also able to look at the Excel
spreadsheets and this is my second
favorite thing about office suite that I
really wish I had on a desktop version
of an opera of a office content creation
is pinch to zoom pinch to zoom works
great on the Excel document I really was
surprised when I did that on I just
naturally pinched a zoom on it and it
worked great and I really wish I had
this type of customizability on a
desktop Excel client you can format all
your cells and rows as well as insert
your formulas and things like that you
know you can change all your
justifications again I'm you have your
separate sheets everything works really
good
I was very impressed with it then going
over here you have your PowerPoint
slides so you can do your slideshow on
here
just to show you a little bit of spread
slideshows except for powerpoints have
never been something that I've done a
lot in my industry so that's not really
something that you know really wowed me
that much because I probably just don't
know the nuances of these slideshows and
things like that however I do use word
documents as well as Excel all the time
and so I was not really able to find
anything in office suite that you know I
really needed to do that they didn't
have any functionality for and so I was
really impressed with office suite pro
and really I gotta say it's probably
worth every penny no matter what they
charge you for this I know that I think
it's normally $30 and it goes on sale
you know often it doesn't really matter
it's totally worth it if you ever do any
content creation and you need to do it
from a tablet works perfect I love this
application I can't sing praises about
it enough I definitely got to tell you
go out and get it thanks for tuning
Android Authority my name is Darrell
doke and definitely check back with us
in the future for other application
reviews as well as handset reviews thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
