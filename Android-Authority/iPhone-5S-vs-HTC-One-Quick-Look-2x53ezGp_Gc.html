smartphones in this quick look it's Josh
of Agartha manager Authority what's
going on everybody and this is the apple
iphone 5s vs. the HTC one we have two
different aluminum clad phones in this
edition as the HTC One took on the metal
body to bring something a little
different compared to most other
smartphone offerings the HTC One takes
on a somewhat similar body to the 5s but
has a much more rounded back that can
make it rock back and forth one lying on
a table with a 4.7 inch screen it isn't
all that difficult to handle in one hand
though the front-facing speakers add
some girth at the top and bottom the
power button is up top of the HTC as
well though it has capacitive keys up
front for back and home Apple's iPhone
5s is also aluminum clad and takes on a
flatter look with rounded corners it's
smaller 4 inch screen gives it a much
easier to handle body in one hand it's
design is very much like the previous
iphone 5 in look feel and button layout
though the home button up front is no
longer concave and houses a fingerprint
reader even though the HTC One is
comparable and easier to handle phone
than most of the 5-inch screen devices
out there it's hard not to notice how
easy the iPhone 5s is in the hand the
screens are a big reason for these phone
sizes the HTC One brings the 4.7 inch
screen and the Super LCD does its 1080p
resolution good justice though its
interface does take on darker tones the
colors are represented well and
everything else is actually still
enjoyable to view the iphone 5s on the
other hand continues the retina display
tradition and it's 11 36 x 640
resolution display does handled and now
more colorful iOS 7 very well the
smaller screen might not do justice to
people who want a much bigger display
experience but if that isn't an issue
for you the iphone 5s still provides a
very good display experience while the
HTC one works with the snapdragon 600
clocked in at 1.7 gigahertz the 5s
introduces a 64-bit capable dual-core a7
processor and 64-bit is a term we will
likely end up seeing a lot in the
upcoming year both of these phones are
very fast especially considering the
demands of their respective ecosystems
and in usage it's not hard to appreciate
how fast both these phones go through
their various elements hardware
offerings actually take on a pretty
similar situation in both phones as the
aluminum unibody designs keep either
phone from having expandable storage or
removable batteries the HTC One does
have a much larger battery at 23
milliamp hours over the 1570 milliamp
hour units in the iphone 5s but with
different power demands in either phone
near usage habits will ultimately
dictate the longevity the HTC one takes
on a bit more drastic of a change in its
camera as HTC buck to the high megapixel
trends and focused on making the four
ultrapixels as high-quality as possible
the app doesn't come with too many
features but includes HTC Zoe for
consolidating your memories lesser
overall features describes the camera in
the iphone 5s as well which doesn't get
a huge boost in its 8 megapixel optics
but does get an overhaul tap interface
while it does get very attractive design
and transition elements between its
modes the main additions include
slow-motion video capture and a square
mode pretty obviously made for him stew
gram will have a more in-depth
comparison of the cameras and their
picture quality soon finally in software
we see somewhat of an overhaul in both
operating systems as iOS 7 has been
given a flatter look that employs
translucent effects it's a very nice and
welcome change for an OS that was
starting to show its age it's easy to
use and it's also easy on the eyes as
additions like the control center and
the updated notification drop-down do
help bring the most use functions into
easy access areas overall however it's
the same general experience that anyone
with even a passing knowledge of iowa's
can find familiar sense on the HTC One
on the other hand did get its own
overhaul by polishing up the general
Android experience while adding in a new
home screen in the form of blinkfeed
this is a tiled screen that consolidates
the various news and social media feeds
you may have in a nice way and of course
the more classic Android experience is
always a single swipe away both do well
to update what we've already been
accustomed to seeing it's just important
to remember that as with everything then
you can eventually fade and in the end
these experiences are essentially what
we already know and so there you have it
the aluminium body is one that is
generally well received in both of these
phone support them well the 5s is
definitely an update worth its salt but
even people with a passing knowledge of
apple's smartphones will find this the
classic experience just with some new
layers up top but the same can be
mentioned about the HTC One though it's
design elements were definitely
considered a more jarring change in the
Android space nonetheless both are great
examples of their respective ecosystems
and so if you want that metal form
factor these two are probably the best
available
we'll have a more in-depth comparison
coming soon so stay tuned to android
authority because we're your source for
all things android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
