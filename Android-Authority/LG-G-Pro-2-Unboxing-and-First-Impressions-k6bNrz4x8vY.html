new larger version of the flagship
device and we also got to walk away with
one hey it's Josh regards manage or
authority what's going on everybody and
it's time to unbox and give my first
impressions on the LG G pro 2 all right
and here it is the LG G pro 2 in this
lovely box right here we're taking a
look at the larger version of the LG g2
and it is sitting right inside so let me
go ahead and just get started let's go
ahead and just open up the box right
there let's go and put down on the side
and there it is the large 5.9 inch
screen of the LG G pro 2 and if we were
to take it out it does still have the
plastic on there and if we turn it
around there is the different finish on
the back that is rather matted but also
is holding the back layout of the
buttons that LG has started to you since
the LG g2 let's start off with the
obvious out of the way first we have our
plug adapter here and also the micro USB
charging cable so go and put that over
here for the moment and then this is
this one is a little maybe slightly
peculiar but there is a nub right here
that goes into the headphone jack of the
phone it's an accessory that is quite
common out in Asia now one of my
favorites that is coming on the LG
phones as of late is the inclusion of
quad beat earphones I use the white
version of these earphones myself when
my bluetooth headphones are out of
battery and they do work very well these
are actually pretty nice earphones and
it's nice that these are an inclusion
with the phone it comes with an extra
battery and a charger for one of the
spare batteries one that's not being
used inside of your phone that's another
great addition that you get but it's
usually only with the Korean version of
the device this one is much like the
optimus G pro charger in that you can
slide the battery into the base here and
then you can actually put the phone in
this little slot right here so that it
acts also as a stand so these are
two batteries right here along with the
charger nice and large 3200 milliamp
hour battery right there alright and
then having the power button right there
let's go ahead and turn this bad boy on
going through the setup right now and
I'm just going to let you know that I
will be doing a future focus on the NOC
code itself showing you how we get set
up and exactly how it works on the
screen basically you'll be able to
create a set pattern on the screen so
that even when the screen is off you'll
be able to hit that pattern tap that a
pattern on the screen and it will wake
up and unlock the phone for you in a
nice and easy way it's actually really
nice alright and we finally make it into
the Optimus UI after quite literally
everything we had to go through in the
setup and as I usually say the Optimus
UI is pretty in your face but all the
things that it can do for example if you
look at the notification drop-down there
is quite literally everything it is able
to do qslide apps as well as you know
the cue memo and all of the power
widgets I turn down the brightness a
little bit so you can actually see how
nice the screen is without it being
really washed out because of the high
brightness you see colors look wonderful
everything is just sort of coming
through greatly that 1080p resolution is
really doing it justice and this is
going to be a great screen to look at
media into watch videos music videos
movies anything like that so that's one
thing that we're really excited about
about this phone now obviously this is a
large device so it is hard for me to
sort of grip the phone and be able to
navigate across all of the elements
quite easily but thankfully it is easy
to grip just sort of on its own in
general it despite its size and that's
primarily because that button layout on
the back does make it so that the
thickness is pretty
pretty low and that is of course so it
doesn't have to a kite doesn't have to
accommodate four buttons on the sides so
that is obviously one of the advantages
of having a back arrow you can hear me
changing the volume rocker that's one of
the advantages you have of having this
particular layout and it's something
only LG does whether or not the mesh
back is good for you is really just up
to your own preference what I do
actually quite like it and mostly
because it's a little bit more
understated but it's something that you
can't deny is definitely there so this
is the LG G pro 2 just as quick unboxing
and first impressions we have a lot of
great accessories inside of the box
itself that hopefully those will be in
there as well for the stateside version
of this phone but until then we are
looking at a very large device the
direct competitor from LG pretty much
towards the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and
while this is just a large smartphone by
all intents and purposes it actually
does rocket very well with a wonderful
screen a very nice feel with a new
material on the back and also the
promise of LG's great display quality on
top of some really wonderful features
like the NOC code which we'll show you
in a future focus soon so keep it tuned
to Android 34 all of the best coverage
of the LG G pro 2 and for all of the new
phones coming out in the coming months
so keep you tuned here javis likes on
