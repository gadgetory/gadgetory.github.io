Android authority and even though
flagship phones are always in OMS main
focus nobody takes more pride in their
mid-range phones than HTC and some of
their mid-range phones don't even really
feel all that mid-range so today we're
taking a look at their latest and
probably the most powerful mid-range
phone they have ever made this is the
HTC Desire 820 if the design of the
Desire 820 looks familiar to you well
that's because this is the spiritual
successor to the desire 816 that came
out earlier this year but it's been
improved pretty much all around it's
still made of glossy polycarbonate with
rounded corners and sides but this time
around is completely unibody and it's
also a lot thinner whether it's plastic
or metal HTC just knows how to make a
quality phone and they've done it again
what they desire 820 it's a little bit
on the slippery side but overall it
feels very solid and lightweight it is a
big phone with some pretty hefty bezels
but it's not any bigger than a lot of
other flagships out there so if you're
used to big phones you'll adjust to the
Desire 820 fairly quickly my favorite
part about the design of the 820 is the
accent colors because it really makes
the phone stand out and gives it a
little bit of extra flair to what would
otherwise be a very plain looking phone
taking a tour around the device you've
got your power button and volume rocker
on the right side and while the volume
rocker is choked up a little higher than
I would like the placement of the power
button on the right side was a much
needed improvement over the 816 from
earlier this year which had it awkwardly
placed on the left everything else is in
its usual place with the 3.5 mini heads
a jack up top micro USB port along the
bottom and a single plastic flap on the
left side that houses the SD card slot
and two SIM slots because this is a dual
SIM device now this would not be an HTC
device if it didn't have front-facing
boomsound speakers and there's
absolutely no surprises here they sound
extremely good they're very loud very
clear and deliver a very clean and rich
sound
part of it now I don't have friends
family also on the front between those
two speakers is the 5.5 inch display
coming in at 720p resolution it's not
the sharpest thing in the world with the
resolution being spread over a 5.5 inch
screen but HTC always knows how to make
a good looking panel regardless of
resolution and the 820 s display is
about as good as it can be with a nice
amount of brightness natural and
accurate colors solid viewing angles and
outdoor visibility it might not be the
highest end panel out there but it's
still very enjoyable to use especially
for games and videos so there's not much
to complain about with the display
inside the Desire 820 is where it starts
to get a little bit interesting the 820
is being powered by a Snapdragon 615
octa-core chip this makes the Desire 820
one of the first Android phones to be
powered by a 64-bit processor and while
it's still running 32-bit software you
at least have the comfort of knowing
that if and when the Android lollipop
update comes your phone will have the
hardware to fully take advantage of the
update the performance as it stands
right now however is actually very
snappy and responsive and even though
this is technically a mid-range phone
the experience feels very high-end so
whether it's doing something basic like
opening up apps to more demanding things
like web browsing multitasking and
playing high-end games the Desire 820
handles everything just fine without
causing much of a problem with the
camera on the Desire 820 you're looking
at a 13 megapixel sensor with LED flash
and the camera interface hasn't changed
all that much from previous HTC devices
it's still a very simple and clean
interface with some manual controls like
ISO white balance exposure all the usual
stuff you might expect there are a
couple of new shooting modes now though
like split capture which lets you take a
photo with the rear camera and the front
camera and it stitches them together
then there's photo booth and it's
exactly what you might think it is it
takes several photos in succession and
stitches them together just
you would get from a photo booth Zoe's
is also still available but if you want
to compile them you'll have to do it
through HTC zone Zoe application with
the 13 megapixel sensor you can take
some pretty high-res photos with a good
amount of color if lighting conditions
are right but more often than not
exposure and white balance are usually
way off causing a lot of detail to be
lost
photos are either completely overexposed
or underexposed causing lights to be way
too bright and darks to be way too dark
HDR however does help alleviate the
issue by creating a much more balanced
shot and bringing out more detail it
certainly doesn't get much better in low
light resulting in a lot of noise making
it virtually impossible to take a usable
photo in dim lighting conditions the
front-facing camera is worth mentioning
simply because it's an 8 megapixel
camera which is a lot higher resolution
than most smartphones out there so if
you're into selfies you can take some
pretty good ones and really take
advantage of the front-facing camera
features like photo booth that I
mentioned earlier as far as the battery
life is concerned you're looking at a
2600 milliamp hour battery and I would
say the battery life is just average
it's nothing spectacular I was getting
anywhere between 13 to 16 hours off the
charger with about three-and-a-half to
four hours of screen on time so I would
say it's definitely more than enough to
get you through a full day but I
wouldn't expect to get anything more
than that taking a look at the software
you're looking at Android 4.4 KitKat
with sense 6 and if you're familiar with
HTC devices then you'll find your way
around fairly quickly as the experience
hasn't changed all that much on the
Desire 820 since is still a fan favorite
when it comes to skins on Android and
for good reason it's a very simple and
clean interface with a lot of nice
features like blinkfeed which still
lives one swipe to the left of your main
home screen and the customizable quick
toggles in the notification shade the
best part about sense is that it brings
all of these enhancements and features
to Android while still maintaining a
very smooth and snappy experience which
is something you can't say about many
Android skins
as with many desire phones there's no
plans on it coming to the United States
at least not yet
but if you want to pick one up I've seen
the price range between four to five
hundred dollars unlocked it does come in
a variety of different colors and it is
3G and 4G LTE capable but there are a
couple of different models floating
around out there so I'd recommend doing
your research and making sure that it is
compatible with your network and there
you have it for the HTC Desire 820 if
you're a fan of the desire lineup and
you're looking for an HTC phablet device
this is probably the closest you are
going to get even though this is a
supposedly mid-range phone it is
definitely on the higher end of the
mid-range spectrum if that makes any
sense because it delivers a very
high-end experience without the high end
price tag of a flagship phone anyways
