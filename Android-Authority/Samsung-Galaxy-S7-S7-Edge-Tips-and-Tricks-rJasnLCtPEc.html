Authority and if you just recently
picked up a Galaxy s7 or s7 edge you may
be wondering what are some cool and
useful things you can do with this phone
well that's what we're going to go over
today with some tips and tricks for your
s7 and s7 edge so diving right into tip
number one and that is how to disable
Flipboard
I know some people may love the
Flipboard briefing home screen but if
you're like me and you can't bear the
sight of it it can be easily turned off
just long press on the home screen swipe
over to the briefing home screen and
from here you'll have a toggle to turn
it off that's all there is to it and if
you ever want to turn it back on just
repeat these steps tip number two is how
to change the screen grid size but
default the screen grid is set to four
by four which to me is a little bit
cramped and doesn't allow you to fully
take advantage of the screen real estate
again changing this one is really easy
to just long press on the home screen
and from the four options on the bottom
you'll want to select screen grid from
here you can pick between four by four
four by five and five by five once
you're happy with your choice just hit
apply and now you should be able to fit
a lot more apps and widgets onto your
home screens coming in at number three
is the camera quick launch and this was
actually introduced on last year's s6
but it's one of my favorite features
that Samsung has ever come up with and
it's extremely useful anytime you want
to get into the camera quickly all you
have to do is double tap the home button
and the camera will fire up this works
no matter where you are within the phone
and also when the phone is locked and
with this feature enabled you don't even
need a camera shortcut on your home
screen
this feature should already be enabled
by default but if it is not just head
into settings go into advanced features
and make sure the Quick Launch camera
option is toggled on next up at number
four is one-handed operation this allows
you to shrink down the interface for
easier one-handed use simply by triple
tapping the home button this feature may
not be super useful on the smaller s7
but on the s7 edge it could definitely
come in handy from time to time to
enable this go to settings and then
select advanced features from here go
into one-handed operation and you'll see
a toggle to reduce the screen size
there's also a toggle for one-handed
input as well which will shift certain
apps like the phone dialer or calculator
to one side of the phone so you can
choose to enable that if you want once
enable just triple tap the home button
anytime you want to trick the screen
down and you'll also have the option to
move it to the left or right side or
return back to full screen our next tip
is how to reorder the edge panels and
this one is specifically for the s7 edge
so with the new edge UX Samsung allows
for up to nine panels be used at one
time and that could be a lot to swipe
through just to find the piece of
information that you're looking for if
there's something that you like to check
frequently like the weather for example
you can put those panels at the
forefront to make them quicker to get to
to reorder the panels just swipe open
the edge interface tap the Settings icon
and select the reorder button in the
upper right from here reordering the
panels is as simple as dragging and
dropping once you're completely
satisfied with your changes just back
out of it and now your edge panel should
be in the exact order that you want next
up is how to move multiple applications
to another home screen one of the most
annoying things about Android when it
comes to organizing and moving apps
around the home screens is that you can
only move one item at a time but Samsung
has come up with a pretty elegant
solution for this just long press and
hold on an application like you normally
would when moving an app and up top you
will see a move apps option up here
once you've dragged an app to it it will
give you the option to select up to five
applications to move after you selected
the applications that you want to move
just swipe to any home screen that you
want and simply drag them back down from
the top to place them tip number seven
is how to make TouchWiz look more like
stock Android the new TouchWiz on the s7
and s7 edge actually isn't that bad
looking but if you're still not a fan
and one a more stock like feel you can
easily do that through the bean store my
favorite theme as of late has been the
Android 6.0 theme but there's a ton of
other ones the easiest way to find them
is the search uptick term like material
and you'll find a bunch that will give
you that stock Android look and feel and
the best thing about it is a good
majority of them are completely free one
of the newest features to the s7 and s7
edge is the always-on display and even
though it's lacking a lot of
functionality right now Samsung does
offer a few ways for you to customize it
you'll find the settings for this under
settings display and then always-on
display with always-on display you can
display a
a calendar or an image so for example if
you want to customize a clock you have
the option to pick from several
different analog and digital clock
styles if you want to spice things up
even more you can add a background image
to the clock you can't use any random
image of your choice and there's only a
few to pick from but the ones that are
available are actually pretty
nice-looking and hopefully this will
expand in the future a feature that I've
always found to be really annoying is
the pop-up view feature if you're not
familiar this lets you shrink the app
into a floating window that you can
manipulate and move around by swiping
inwards from the top left or right
corners but often times you may find
yourself just trying to pull down the
notification shade and end up activating
the pop-up view instead the good news is
with the s7 and s7 edge Samsung has
finally given us an option to turn it
off again you'll find this one under
advanced features in the settings just
tap on pop-up View gesture toggle it off
and you'll never have to deal with it
again our last and final feature is how
to keep the screen from turning itself
on when you don't want it to because the
s7 and s7 edge have a physical home
button it can be prone to accidental
presses from something like bumping into
a table or getting tossed around in a
bag which can ultimately waste a lot of
battery life if the screen is constantly
getting woken up when you're not
actually using the phone to enable this
feature go into settings and under the
display section you'll find an option
for keeping the screen turned off once
you've been able to feature your phone
will never accidentally turn itself on
in a pocket bag or any other dark
environment and that premature apps it
