good for you now here's five things you
should do right away now I know this is
an obvious one here but you really want
to set up your fingerprint scanner
you'll be prompted to set up the one
plus five fingerprint scanner during
initial set up but if you skip that step
and you're in a rush you'll have to play
around with the software so be sure to
go back and register your digits and to
do that you just go to settings security
and fingerprint and add fingerprint next
step you want to enable dark mode
unlike many Android phones oneplus has
full support for a system-wide dark
scene the fact that the oneplus 5 has an
AMOLED screen means you should strongly
consider switching to the dark theme as
your default right out of the box you
see that's because AMOLED displays can
actually save battery life by using dark
themes and backgrounds black pixels on
an OLED display can actually be turned
off unlike black pixels on an LCD panel
which still have to be backlit the fewer
pixels requiring power of course the
longer your battery will last plus it
just looks good because OLED screens
have great contrast and inky blacks so
just go to settings display theme and
choose the default as dark next up is to
set up your gestures now off screen
gestures are nothing new but just like
the double tap to wake they're actually
pretty useful to know some are enabled
by default while others will need to be
switched on or set up there's double tap
to wake a camera shortcut just double
press the power button or you can draw
letters when the screen is off to launch
the app or start to flash light the best
thing of all is that they are fully
customizable just go to settings
gestures to set them all up next up is
to enable battery percentage in the
status bar really this is super useful
because you can quickly glance at your
status bar rather than have to guess or
pull down the notification shade to see
what battery percentage you have left
just head to settings status bar then
show battery percentage now finally
let's talk about setting the vibration
intensity setting one plus is preview
phones had horrible vibration motors but
that's all been fixed with the one plus
five now you have the option to tweak
the intensity to exactly how you like it
from light medium and strong for
incoming calls notifications and general
interactions to set this up you just go
to settings sound and vibration
vibration intensity and incoming calls
just keep in mind though if you do have
those higher vibration settings it will
drain your battery life pretty fast just
a warning for those of you who want to
put it in your pocket just keep calling
yourself a big kid man I couldn't resist
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
