thority and it's been a while since I've
made one of these meet the team videos I
believe the last one that I made was
like two years ago maybe a little bit
longer than that somewhere around that
time it's been a while so I wanted to
make a video updating that just to
update you guys on how I've been what
I've been up to and things like that and
on top of that I also want to give you
guys sort of a behind-the-scenes look
give you guys a little bit of a desk
tour of my setup here around the office
and also talk a little bit about how I
shoot video and the equipment that I use
to achieve the shots that you see in a
lot of my videos so first things first
the first thing that has changed quite a
bit is that I moved three times since
I've started making videos for Android
Authority actually no I've moved twice
I've moved twice yeah twice anyways so
when I first started making videos for
Android authority I was actually living
in my parents house and I have no shame
in admitting that if you're Asian you
totally understand because Asian Asian
people tend to just stick together and
stay at their parents house for an
extremely long amount of time but I did
move out shortly after joining Android
Authority and I moved into a two-bedroom
apartment but I was with a roommate so I
still only had one room to myself and I
was still working out of my own bedroom
but I had a lot more flexibility as to
when I could shoot and when I could
record audio because I was in my own
space and I didn't really have to
concern myself with my parents and stuff
like that so I definitely had a lot more
freedom in my own place but at the same
time it was still really cramped because
I was working out of my own bedroom but
that was when you saw this particular
setup right here which was basically
just the one desk with the iMac sitting
on it and I tried my best not to show
the entire bedroom I really just only
showed the office portion of it but it
was really rough to do that because it
was so cramped but now I am in this
place and I've been in this place for
the past I want to say six to eight
months now so I've been here for a while
and I really enjoyed this is another
two-bedroom two-bathroom apartment but
I'm here by myself
I do not have a roommate this time
around so I have both rooms to myself
and I'm actually using the master
bedroom as the office and I use the
smaller room as my bedroom and you might
be wondering why I use the master
bedroom as my office well that's because
it's the bigger room and it has more
room for me to move stuff around more
room for me to expand if I want to and
it also has a lot more storage capacity
for storing all my devices and all my
camera equipment all my gear all that
good stuff which I'll talk about in a
second now as far as everything else I'm
still pretty much the same person as I
was two years ago or two and a half
years ago when I started making videos
for Android Authority I still am into
the same stuff I still really love
sports
still I'm really into music still I'm
really into dancing although I don't do
is do it as much as I would like and I'm
still really into superheroes and comic
book comic book movies and all that good
stuff as you can tell from everything
that's on my desk and hanging up on the
wall but enough about me I don't want to
ramble on too much so let's go ahead and
move on to my desk setup and I'll talk a
little bit about how I shoot video so
this is my desk and setup that you guys
have seen in my videos for the past
several months and like I said I chose
to put this setup in the master bedroom
because it's a much bigger room and
gives me a lot more flexibility starting
with the desk themselves these are the
matte white linman style tabletops from
Ikea and all together with the legs they
are really inexpensive at $40 so I went
ahead and got two of them and put them
together in an L shape now you'll notice
that one of them has a bright green
accent going around the sides of the
tabletop and it's actually nothing more
than green colored scotch tape I really
like the look of it and it's an easy and
cheap way to make a white desk not look
so plain for decoration I have a lot of
superhero Star Wars and Android
figurines on my desk and I know not
everyone is a fan of having knickknacks
on their desks but this is all stuff
that I enjoy and love collecting and it
just looks good in the background of
videos for lighting I have Philips hue
Blum lights sitting on the corners of my
desk I project light up against the wall
and to fill in the space in between the
bloom lights is an LED strip running
behind the desk I've talked about these
lights in length in a previous video so
I won't say
too much about them here but there are
awesome lights and can really spruce up
any setup that you have in your home
along the walls I have a large wall art
of downtown Kansas City which I also got
from Ikea and on the adjacent wall I
have this spider-man canvas art that I
picked up from Amazon and I think both
of these together fill up the walls
really well and complete the look of my
office my main editing machine that I
use is a 2013 iMac and even though it's
a couple years old now it still runs
really well and has more than enough
power to edit my videos the keyboard and
mouse that I'm currently using are both
made by Logitech I have the Logitech k7
50 wireless keyboard and I absolutely
love this keyboard because it has a
dedicated number pad and it's
solar-powered so you don't have to
charge it or replace the batteries like
you would with Apple's own keyboard the
mouse I'm using is a mouse that a lot of
people are probably familiar with but
this is the MX master and it's a pretty
awesome Mouse it's comfortable and
definitely a great Mouse for casual use
and for editing you'll also find a blue
Yeti microphone sitting on my desk but
even though it's plugged in I don't ever
actually use it except for maybe when
I'm on the occasional podcast but for
the most part it's just there for
decoration for shooting videos the
camera that I'm currently using is the
Canon 70d paired with the Sigma 18 to 35
F 1.8 lens as my primary lens I also
have a tiff and variable ND filter
mounted on in front of my lens which
allows me to shoot wide open at F 1.8
regardless of if I'm shooting outdoors
on a bright sunny day or indoors under
the lighting of my softboxes the tripod
that I use is the Manfrotto 0 55 series
tripod with a 502 head which is what
allows me to get those really smooth
pans when shooting product shots I also
have a secondary Manfrotto tripod and
the reason why I have two tripods is so
that I can mount my konova k2 slider
whenever I feel like doing those fancy
slider shots that you've probably seen
many times in my videos so if you've
ever wondered how I go about getting
those shots the canova slider is what
allows me to achieve them as for audio I
mostly record audio with my Audio
Technica 875 our shotgun microphone
that's hooked up to a zoom h4n via XLR
this is the audio that you usually hear
when I'm sitting in front of the camera
talking but if I'm doing purely
voiceover work then I'll just record the
audio directly into the h4n for editing
I use Final Cut Pro
ten or Final Cut Pro X and I love fun Oh
cut because it's a very powerful piece
of editing software but at the same time
it's very simple and I've gotten so used
to editing with it that it works really
well for me and my workflow that I can't
really see myself using anything else to
edit video but that pretty much wraps it
up for this video guys hopefully you all
enjoyed this little update video
this desk setup tour and a little bit of
behind the scenes look of how I shoot
and edit video and if you enjoyed this
