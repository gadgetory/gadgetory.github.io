brought to you by domain.com so we found
a couple clues of what we can expect for
Android M we also talked about what we
want an Android M and you give us a poll
in what you think the M in and read em
will stand for Milky Way marshmallow
muffin marzipan Arang marmalade macaron
Maltesers Maltesers so Google i/o is
next week and Google accidentally posted
some information about their workshops
regarding Android M they have since
taken them down but we've scooped them
for you and let's start with Android for
work the biggest clue we do have about
Android M came from the i/o scheduling
description on an android for work
update which was later removed it
started with the line Android M is
bringing the power of android to all
kinds of workplaces it's possible
Android M will offer more options for
configuration and control and IT
departments perhaps employee tracking
will figure in their Android devices are
already flooding into work spaces as
part of the bring your own device to
work trend and they are generally
cheaper than alternatives and write M
can make moves to capitalize on this
trend it certainly looks like they will
beef up security credentials we may see
improvements in the smart lock feature
and more user authentication techniques
designed to make it easier to maintain
security based on Android devices and
for those of us who insist on texting
while driving we expect to see more
voice controls there is a chance that
voice controls are going to be rolled
out across the platform you'll be able
to use them to navigate around your
device with voice alone the speculation
about this was based on another session
that also seems to have been removed
from the schedule from the sounds of it
this could be focused on improving the
Android auto experience but we really
can't say for sure at this point now
let's talk about what we really want to
see I know it's a first world problem
but let's talk unified notifications
Android users with multiple devices will
be familiar with this issue you get the
same notification on your SmartWatch or
smartphone on your tablet and you have
to dismiss that notification on all
three obviously you only need to see the
notification once why can't Android work
out which device to alert or at least
dismiss the notification on all devices
once you've dismissed it on one we're
hoping to see some
proper synchronization on notifications
in Android M not everyone loves the
notification system but google has been
trying to improve it most recently with
priority options a single hub for
unified messaging from all your
different email and messaging accounts
is something we've seen people asking
for repeatedly maybe by adding expand
and reply options for everything that
comes into your notification shade this
existing system may become exactly that
now I'm not personally a fan of this but
a lot of you were looking for a split
screen and floating apps it's been
almost a year now since we suggested
split-screen should come back to stock
Android as screens get bigger it makes
sense to be able to open a couple of
apps at once it's especially handy on a
tablet manufacturers have led the way
with split screen options and floating
apps it's about time Google baked it
into the platform the problem with split
screens and floating apps is that it can
become cluttered and ugly very quickly
how can the user designer make it in
such a way that that doesn't happen I'd
be interested if they could do that now
allow me to dream for just a moment i
can dream can I this is just my personal
take I'm deviating from the article a
little bit but what I'm looking for is a
truly unified media hub now I know
there's a little bit of this but I'm
talking about a place where all my
podcasts audiobooks videos all my media
can be in one hub that syncs across
multiple devices because I spend an
inordinate amount of time deleting and
adding content from one device because I
started it on my phone and now I'm
finishing on my tablet or my computer
and stuff like that like it's crazy you
spend them on a time adding stuff like
this especially because storage space is
so limited you should be able to
automatically delete and remove things
across multiple devices that's what I'm
dreaming for what about you what are you
dreaming for let me know in the comments
below what is the number one feature you
hope Android M will have now my number
one choice didn't even make it on the
pole but it looks like most of you think
that Android M will actually be Android
marshmallow I'm hoping for milkshake
we'll see you know what I want to hear
about your websites if you have a domain
name for your business or your blog or
just for your own personal fun I'd like
to hear about it please link it up in
the comments below but better
that tell me about the story of that
name how you got the domain name wasn't
hard to get all that kind of stuff and
for the people with the best story I
will feature it here in this segment and
give you a little plug but tell me how
you chose that name was hard to get the
dot-com I'd love to hear about it why
because no domain name extension tells
your story with the same level of trust
as a.com or.net domain name dot com
and.net domain name extensions and Jack
credibility in to your online presence
and who doesn't want more credibility
you can say fifteen percent on domain
name and web hosting is when you use our
coupon code android at domain.com check
out don't forget fifteen percent off
when you use our coupon code android
when you think domain names think
domain.com that's right link up your
site's below i'll be checking them out
you also want to check out my brothers
in android who are trying to be your
source for all things android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
