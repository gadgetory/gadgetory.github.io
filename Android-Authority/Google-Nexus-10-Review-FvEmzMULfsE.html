Authority what's going on everybody and
you've seen me on the gorgeous 2560 by
1600 display of this the Google Nexus 10
designed by Samsung the next generation
of the Nexus line has arrived and this
is the big gun in the arsenal the Nexus
10 serving as the Big Brother to the
Nexus 7 this 10 inch tablet hopes to
reach those looking for the Android
experience only bigger badder and for an
affordable price starting at 399 what do
you get with this new tablet for
starters you realize that this is a
serious piece of hardware
if you've ever complained that
smartphones keep getting bigger you
should be prepared for the sheer size of
this thing from side to side this tablet
spans almost ten and a half inches while
top to bottom is about seven luckily
handling the tablet feels natural after
a while it's obvious from the button
layout that you are supposed to be
holding the Nexus 10 in landscape mode
pretty much all the time the power and
volume buttons are found in the top left
corner and while the volume buttons felt
sturdy I feared that the slightly
recessed power button might someday sink
in and become unusable around the corner
on the left side is the microUSB port
and headphone jack while the opposite
side holds the mini HDMI port the bottom
of the device has some pogo pins and
magnetic strips that hopefully will
become useful when a dock is actually
released for this device on the front is
the front facing camera and a
notification light which I thought was a
nice touch coming to the back the camera
is found at the top and is surrounded by
a tacky material that almost felt sticky
to the touch it helps to give a gripping
feel but I actually found myself unhappy
with the backs design it looks like the
back of a laptop monitor from the early
2000s it just looks bland and quite
frankly a little boring but all this
blandness is supposed to make the screen
pop and it certainly does that the 10.1
inch screen is a 300 dpi capable beast
and displays an incredible resolution of
2560 by 1600 I can't stress enough how
gorgeous things look on this screen I
found myself watching Netflix and
YouTube on this device more often than
on my laptop just a few feet away the
high resolution makes text and graphics
render very well no matter what size
text reviewing it will look crisp and
sharp web browsing on a screen like this
is an enjoyable breeze and unlike with
smaller devices
you don't have to even zoom in that far
to read what's on a webpage that's the
beauty of a larger screen games fared
well - as the Mali graphics processor
made 3d gaming a treat it's hard not to
enjoy the experience of seeing
everything in action on the screen like
when you use the force to send those
Angry Birds flying or you're zooming
past
all of the bright lights and asphalt
some criticize the Android app ecosystem
for not having many tablet optimized
choices but even when scaled up apps
look great behind the high resolution
and Corning Gorilla Glass layer you may
wish for a bit of polish in some of your
abdic spear Ian PSA's but then again you
might be having too much fun to care all
this power comes from a dual-core 1.7
gigahertz a 15 processor and 2 gigabytes
of RAM for all the multitasking you
could want even if there is a lack of
course compared to some of the
competition you really don't notice it
very much when in practice the high
performance shows through the smooth and
snappy load times on paper the Nexus 10
seems to perform just above average as
this benchmark app rates it among the
best mid tier devices still feel the
performance for yourself and you'll feel
the way I did that number is just a
number the Nexus 10 comes in 16 or 32
gigabite varieties but has no expandable
memory it seems a bit of a shame that
there are no SD card slots as with a
screen this good
I felt like viewing high-res pictures
from a DSLR would have been nice but
this is just another example of how
expandable memory is sacrificed to keep
costs down the hardware I'm delighted to
report on are the speakers bucking the
trend of having the one speaker on the
back samsung has put the Nexus 10's 2
speakers on the sides quite easily
missed by the naked eye and seemingly
pointed right at the user this makes for
a sound experience unlike any other
found on a tablet whereas the Nexus 7
has weak and thin sound Samsung should
be applauded for thinking outside the
box with the sound experience on the
Nexus 10
dual speakers a killer screen and some
processing power definitely make the
Nexus 10 a power-hungry device so one
would hope that the battery is able to
keep up sadly this isn't truly the case
as after a test involving Netflix and
Bluetooth streamed audio the tablet
clocked out at around the five hour mark
I'm sure that was some frugal usage the
tablet should easily hit the eight hours
or more mark but it is likely that
you'll be bringing the included charging
cable with you for when the juice runs
out the last piece of hardware is the
camera samsung has a pedigree of cameras
and camcorders so you'd hope that this
tablet will bug another trend and come
bundled with the capable optics
unfortunately the Nexus 10 joins the
long lineage of lackluster camera
offerings on tablets which has 5
megapixels I've just felt like an
opportunity was missed here when the
galaxy s3 also a Samsung product comes
with 8 megapixels and is a more than
capable performer as far as software
goes the updated camera provided in
jelly bean 4.2 brings some nice new
features the viewfinder has done away
with traditional menus and is not
controlled by a touch and swipe
interface which fits very well
photosphere is also included which
allows for 360 degrees shots to capture
Google Streetview like pictures hanging
around to take these shots is a bit of a
chore though and without a great camera
it's hard to take advantage of all these
features and besides imagine the remarks
people will make much like when people
try to take pictures with an iPad yeah
just don't do it and finally with the
Nexus device you can rest assured that
you will be getting the latest and
greatest that Android has to offer the
Nexus 10 and for both come with the
newest OS jelly bean 4.2 which bring
with it some new features the keyboard
now comes with gesture typing much like
that found in alternative keyboards like
swipe while it is nice to have it
probably won't keep you from installing
your favorite replacement anyway new
notification drop-down menu is bring a
new and easy way to toggle your settings
your usual notices are found on the left
while your most used settings will be
populated on the right this is a welcome
and handy new feature that translates
well to tablet interfaces and of course
there is Google now with all of its
cards and automatically populated
information it works just about the same
as it did in the previous update but
those who haven't used jellybean before
will find Google now easy on the eyes
and useful most notable is its
integrated search which includes
Google's much-loved voice
search directions to in and out
and so there you have it Google's newest
official devices are out now and they
bring a couple new choices to an already
crowded smartphone and tablet market the
only question now is which one you would
pick personally I prefer the Nexus 7
size and portability but the Nexus 10
just makes viewing movies browsing web
pages and even gaming even more fun the
spectacular screen and good sound help
in this regard even if the chroma camera
and average battery life go against this
otherwise great entry into the tablet
market if you're looking to get your
first big tablet this holiday season
this is definitely a great place to
start from my full written review go to
Android authority calm your source for
