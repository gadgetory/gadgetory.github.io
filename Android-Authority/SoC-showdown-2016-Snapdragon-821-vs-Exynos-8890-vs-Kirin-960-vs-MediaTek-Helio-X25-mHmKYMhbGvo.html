authority now 2016 has been really quite
an interesting year maybe there are some
things you want to forget in 2016 I hope
there are some things that you also want
to remember now in the area of mobile
processors there's been quite a lot of
activity and this year we see processes
from Qualcomm and from Samsung of a
media taken from Huawei that are all
vying for position as the best processor
of 2016 so which is the best processor
well we're going to put them through the
test we're gonna look at some benchmarks
and see which one comes out top so if
you're ready let's go so we remember at
the end of last year the leading
protestors were the snapdragon 810 and
the Exynos 7420
and they were both octa-core processors
using four cortex a 57 cores from arm
and 4 cortex a53 calls from arm and they
were using heterogeneous
multi-processing which we'll talk about
in just a minute now fast-forward a year
and things are quite different now we
have quad-core processors we have
octa-core protease we even have a Decker
core 10 core processor that are vying
for position as the best air SOC of 2016
so this year we're going to look at four
different processors the first is going
to be the Snapdragon 820 one it's not
like an eight to one and along the way
we're also gonna look at the Snapdragon
820 because these really are kind of
twin processes the eight to one is about
ten percent better than the 820 but
essentially the same processor what are
we looking at the Exynos 88-90 which is
a processor from samsung we will be
looking at the media tech x.25 which is
the Decker core processor from media
tech and we're going to be looking at
the ki-rin
960 which is the leading processor from
Huawei so let's start by looking at the
Snapdragon 820 and the 821 now last year
Qualcomm we're using cause they license
directly from our McCord it's a 57 and
the cortex a53 have an issue they use in
their own in-house core design and they
can do that because they have an
architectural license from arm which
allows them to design their own cause as
long as they are instruction set and
architecture compatible with arm
specific
patience and the core call the qualcomm
of design is the cry oh now that
Snapdragon 820 may 21 have four cryo
calls now two of those calls are high
performance calls that are clocked up to
2.4 gigahertz and then there are 2 more
power-efficient cryo calls that are
clocked at 1.6 gigahertz max in the 820
or 2 gigahertz max in the 821 and those
are used for the less computing
intensive tasks let's say like streaming
video of course the other big thing
about the the Snapdragon 820 a 21 is the
Adreno 530 GPU which again is a custom
GPU designed specifically by Qualcomm
themselves now the next processor in our
lineup is the Samsung Exynos 88-90 and
it's a really interesting processor now
it's an octa-core design like the 7420
before it for of the cores in there are
cortex a53 calls just like the cortex
7420 from last year and the cortex 53
base a 53 is the energy efficient core
from arm that is used for those low CPU
intensive tasks like streaming video or
checking your email or things like that
but at the top end rather than using a
core from arm Samsung designed their own
core a core called the m1 and Samsung
also have an architectural license with
with arm which means they're allowed to
design their own cause have to be fully
arm compatible now the m1 took three
years to design and it's the first time
that Samsung are designing an arm
compatible core for their CPU so you've
got four cores designed by arm for
course designed by Samsung to give you
that octa-core setup now along with
those eight cores you've also got the
Mali t8 80 DP you this is the MP 12
version which is got 12 rendering cores
inside of it now the next process in our
lineup is a really interesting one it's
from mediatek and it's called the x.25
it's not a quad-core processor it's not
an octa-core processor it's a Decker
core process it's got 10 cores inside of
it this is actually quite amazing
now what mediatek have done is they've
taken the cortex a 72 core from arm and
they've put two of those in the x.25 and
they are there for the heavy lifting and
it's clocked at 2.5
gigahertz now there are 10 chords that's
two of them now the other 8 cores are in
fact cortex a53 calls the same as what
you find in the Samsung the same was
what you find in some of the chips from
last year and that a 53 is great at
energy efficiency but it's not
necessarily that fast so what they've
done is they've added in the a 72 and
then they've got 8 cores that are caught
it's a 53 and these caught is a 53 cause
I divided themselves into two clusters
now on the GPU side it's also using the
Mali t8 80 just like the Exynos 88-90
but the difference is here it's only got
four rendering cause the the excellence
has 12 them this has four however they
are clocked at a higher clock rates so
hopefully that clock rate will boost the
performance and we'll see when we get to
the benchmarks in a moment now the last
process we're going to be looking at
today is a new one from while always I
think all the high silicon Kiran 960
high silicon is a wholly owned
subsidiary of Huawei and it's really
bleeding edge this process this serpro
processor has four cortex a 73 calls not
a 72 like the age 25 or like the Kiran
950 before it but a 73 calls which is
really the latest call from arm then
there are four cortex a53 calls for the
power efficiency and then on top of that
there is the mali g71 GPU the newest GPU
available from arm it's a whole new
architecture in fact that arm of
designed for their next generations of
GPU so this processor is really bleeding
edge cortex a 73 and the mali g71 GPU
and it could be really interesting to
see how this processor competes with the
others
now I've used this term heterogeneous
multi-processing a few times just a
quick summary what it means is not all
the cores are equal so there are some
cores that are high performance and
there are some cause that are high
energy efficiency and the high
performance ones use more power when
they're running
however hopefully they can complete
tasks quicker and they can give you that
big performance and then the more power
efficient ones are not don't have the
same performance they run slower however
they don't use as much power and
therefore the CPU switches between these
cores depending on the workload trying
to give you that balance between highest
performance
and highest power efficiency okay so
let's look at the testing now to do the
testing I've got three different types
or benchmark now the first types of
benchmark are basically your standard
apps you download from the Play Store
and - - Geekbench Basemark and so on and
we can be looking at the performance of
each of these processors using those
benchmarks then the second or third
group are benchmarks that I have written
myself now obviously I can't test the
SOC without it being inside of a
smartphone so I've got hold of a bunch
of phones to do this testing and these
are the phones I'm going to be using for
the Snapdragon 8 - 1 I'm going to be
using the Google pixel for the Exynos
88-90 I'm going to be using the Galaxy
s7 obviously the Exynos variant of that
for the MediaTek x.25 I'm going to be
using the meizu Pro a6
and for the high silicon Kirin 960 I'm
going to be using the huawei mate 9 now
on the way I've also tested the
Snapdragon 820 to see how it compares to
the 821 and I'm going to be using the
Galaxy s7 Qualcomm variant for that also
for I'm also going to test against the
Snapdragon 810 which is one of last
year's leading processors and to do that
I'm going to be using the Nexus 6p and
finally I'm also going to be using the
note 5 that actually Note 5 to compare
with the Exynos 7420 also from last year
so hopefully we'll get a good overview
of how last year's processors compare to
this year's as well as how this is
processors compare against each other so
let's start with and - - now as you can
see here the winner of the antutu
benchmark is the Snapdragon 801 as found
inside of the Google pixel second-place
comes the Exynos 88-90 in the Samsung s7
and in third place comes to kill in 960
now there's a few things here to note
first of all see the difference in the
antutu scores between this year's
processors and last year's processors we
can actually see there's been a
significant increase even from the
Snapdragon 810 up to the ki-rin 960 we
see at least a 30% increase in the
performance
now the next test we're going to be
using is Geekbench four and a Geekbench
four gives us two different types of
results the first is the single core
result which tells you how fast one core
is on that processor regard to how many
calls there are in total and the other
is the multi-core result we tells you
what happens if it uses all the cores at
the same time to give you the
performance of the processor when all of
its cause are being used so looking at
the Geekbench for single core results we
can see clearly the winner is the
quirian 960 and that's using the cortex
a 73 in second place you get the Exynos
88-90 with its m1 processor from samsung
and in third place you get the Helio
X 25 which is course got the cortex a 72
so the a 73 is the fastest the m1 comes
next and then the a 72 after that so
moving on to the Geekbench for multi
score tests we see that the ki-rin 960
is the fastest with a score of six
thousand two hundred and ninety eight
followed by that is the Exynos 88-90 in
third place comes the mediatek helio X
25 it's an interesting result from the
MediaTek X 25 because it has ten cores
now it just shows those ten calls
couldn't do the same thing as the eight
calls in the eight eight ninety or
inside the nine sixty and the reason for
that of course is that eight of those
cores are cortex a53 causes are very
good at power efficiency but they're not
the highest performance and in fact the
x.25 is relying on the performance of
the to a 72 calls to boost up its
overall performance now the next set of
benchmarks I'm going to be using base
mark and a vellum oh no both of these
are popular benchmarks they test more
the CPU than the GPU although the base
mark does also do some GPU testing and
what's interesting about the velum o
test is that it has inside of it one of
the tests that uses is called the dry
stone test and the dry stone test is
quite a classic put a benchmark test and
it only tests integer performance of the
CPUs are no floating-point so when it
comes to a base mark here again we see
that the keyring 960 is the winner then
in second place is the X naught 8 8 90
and then in third comes a snap
dragon eight-to-one when you then switch
over to the ELMO now this time the
Exynos 88-90 comes in first place is the
first time the exhaust is coming first
place so far so well done to Samsung for
that and then next we have the h20
notice has a better score than the 821
and then finally have the quirian 960
and then looking at the dry stone scores
we can see that the X naught 8 890 is
the fastest at integer computing in fact
by quite a long way
then next of all you have the Helio X 25
with its cortex a 72 cores in it and
then in third place we have the
Snapdragon 820 again having a better
score than the Snapdragon 820 one so now
on to my own custom benchmarking the
first one is basically just does some
math it does some sha-1 hash is it does
some prime numbers stuff it just some
sorting of a big table and the whole
test run then it gives you how long it
took to run to the shorter the lower the
value the better the score is and the
second test is a 2d physics simulation
which puts in two drops of water into a
simulation every set every frame and
there are 60 frames a second that then
runs for 90 seconds and the top score
should be ten thousand eight hundred and
as we can see the quirian 960 comes in
first with the shortest test run then
his second place we have the Snapdragon
820 one and then a good performance in
third place by the heli h25 which just
managed to beat the Exynos 88-90 and
over to the 2d water physics simulation
we can see here the skier Ian scored a
maximum score of ten thousand eight
hundred drops of water during the 90
second test run that's the maximum that
any device can get so Kirin maxed out
this test completely in second place
interestingly we find the Exynos 7420 so
that's the process in the note 5 from
last year that actually comes in second
place and then in third place we get the
exhaust 88-90 the phone that the process
of us in the s7 this year and because
the Curie 960 has maxed out this test
for 2007 we have to write a new one
because this one
no good anymore now I've also got one
more benchmark that I wrote this when I
wrote in unity3d it's basically a
terrain fly over camera flies over
complicated terrain of rocks and and
trees and water and so on and we can see
here the GPU King is the Snapdragon 820
one with 37.3 frames per second in fact
in second place would also be the
Snapdragon 820 because it has the same
GPU but if we group those two together
the Adreno 530 comes in first place in
second place comes in the ki-rin 960
with the arm mali g71 GPU and then the
third place is the Exynos 88-90 with the
Mali t8 80 MP 12 GPU and my first set of
tests of the C tests that I use from my
java and see comparison loaded earlier
this year again there are three tests
doing things like sha-1 hash is like
doing prime numbers and doing some maths
functions and it's just measure how long
it takes so al over time the faster the
performance and as we can see here the
Snapdragon 820 and a 1020 almost
identical scores across these three
tests so we declare the 820 and 821 as
the joint winner for these particular
tests then we can see that overall the
ki-rin 960 comes in second place and the
Exynos 88-90 comes in third since you've
all been paying attention so well you've
got this far in the video I want to just
throw you something a surprise here
let's compare how some of these
processors compare to the Apple a10
fusion so first of all looking at the
Basemark OS to benchmark we see that the
a10 fusion beats the keyring and the 890
and the Snapdragon 8 to 1 and comes in
first in second place we get the killer
in 960 which is no surprise because
that's how its scored in the base mark
test earlier on and then in third place
the Exynos 88-90 and then when we get
down to the Geekbench single core test
again we find the a-10 is the winner
it's got the fastest single core however
in second place again we get the keyring
960 and then in third place the Exynos
88-90 and if you think it's all doom and
gloom for the android SOC it's not
once we get into the multi-core test
when all the calls are being used to
give you the overall performance of the
processor we find that the ki-rin 960 is
the clear winner beating the Exynos
88-90 and beating the appellate in
fusion in fact the x98 890 also beats
the a10 fusion so it's killing first X
in our second and then Apple a10 fusion
third and lastly I use my 2d water
physics simulation again on the iPhone
so we've got result across all the
different process here and we can see
again the quirian maxed out let's test
at 10,800 something the a the iPhone was
not able to do so now we've done all the
scores which one's the winner well one
thing we know for sure is the GPU in the
Snapdragon 820 821 is X on the Adreno
530 and that does boost the overall
scores of this processor in test like +
2 2 and other tests that have a GPU
heavy GPU component however when you're
looking at the CPU performance we find
that the quirian a 960 and the Exynos
88-90 perform better if we kept all the
scores GPU NCP and everything the ki-rin
961 the most test out of all of them and
it came second and third consistently
across the others in second place really
is the Exynos 88-90 or because although
it didn't win many tests it always was
there in second or third place with a
strong performer across all the
different types of tests now the thing
about the ki-rin 960 and about the
Samsung is the number of handsets we can
find these process is actually quite
limited they're going to be in some sang
some devices I know that Samsung made to
do some contract with a couple of other
handset manufacturers while way
basically are you going to find them in
Huawei handsets so if you're looking for
a processor that's going to be in a
phone from another OEM say HTC or
Samsung or LG then really you're going
to have to go with the Qualcomm and the
Qualcomm has also proved to be a great
Pro so both the 820 and the 821 so my
