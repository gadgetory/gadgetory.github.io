authority here we're taking a look at
how the new HTC One and the HTC One x+
compare to each other starting with
design and build quality this is more
though HTC One is going to have the
advantage over a lot of phones while
plastic is lighter the aluminum body
used by the HTC one just feels sturdy
not that the HTC One x+ feels flimsy but
it's definitely not metal on the other
hand it does weigh eight grams less the
snapdragon 600 chipset and the HTC one
runs a 1.7 gigahertz processor ads does
the Tegra 3 chipset in the One x+ though
the HTC One has two gigs of ram to the
One x+ is one gig at the upper end
storage the same on both phones at 64
gigabytes though the HTC One and the HTC
One x+ share their screen size of 4.7
inches they don't share the resolution
while the 720p display on the HTC One X
bus is far from bad it just can't stand
up to the 1080p display on the HTC one
the HTC One x+
has a smaller battery than the HTC One
2100 milliamp hours to 2300 milliamp
hours considering I found battery life
on the Droid DNA better than the HTC One
x+ the HTC One will probably win in this
category both phones run jellybean with
the HTC One running 4.1.2 to the One x+
is 4.1.1 users may not be sure what they
think of blinkfeed but HTC Zoe alone
probably gives HTC Sense 5 on the one an
edge-on for Plus which runs on the One
x+ the one area where the HTC One x+
might have an edge is its GeForce GPU
which I found to be a little faster than
the Adreno 320 GPU used by the HTC One
now this was what I tested the HTC Droid
DNA
so the new Snapdragon chipset may allow
it to run faster in the end the choice
probably comes down to style but really
there's not
- a reason to recommend the One x+ over
the HTC One I'm Chris walk and thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
