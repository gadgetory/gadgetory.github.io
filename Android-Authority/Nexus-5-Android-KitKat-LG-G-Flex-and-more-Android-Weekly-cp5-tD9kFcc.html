know what I'm talking about but while
much of the news was centered around the
Nexus 5 this week there was plenty of
other news to go around eight stretch
your Garth manager authority what's
going on everybody and it's time for
another dose of the week's top Android
news it's android weekly before we get
into all of the Nexus 5 and Android 4.4
KitKat however let's take care of a
couple of announcements that also
happened this week the curved display
craze is starting to pick up steam
especially since a lot of the rumors are
starting to become true and we start off
with LG's camp the G flex has been made
official sporting a top to bottom curve
this six-inch phone going against the
curve is also providing some very nice
specifications the Snapdragon 800 a 13
megapixel camera and a 3,500 milliamp
hour battery all come in this smartphone
who's button layout is also on the back
ala the g2 it's also coming sooner than
later at least in Korea as major
carriers will get the g flex this month
in Motorola's camp some really
interesting developments are afoot
anybody that saw that innovative and
creative phonebloks campaign can look to
Motorola for what looks like a very
substantial conceptualization called
project ara this new way of looking at
our smartphones has apparently been in
the works for about a year and involves
devices that are essentially
endoskeleton into which modules for
different features can be inserted the
result is a smartphone that is not only
completely customizable but can provide
a sustainable system for just about any
customer while all of this is just a
concept at the moment it's an idea that
is certainly gaining steam and we're
really excited to see where it may go
and finally let's get into what was one
of the most anticipated but also one of
the worst kept secrets in 2013 yep I'm
talking about the google nexus 5 in a
partnership with LG and google we get a
great smartphone that maybe we didn't
get a big press event for but that
didn't stop the Nexus 5 from becoming
sold out pretty much immediately the
excellent Snapdragon 800 processor makes
it onto your Nexus experience and should
help what was a somewhat controversially
small 2300 million power battery unit
perhaps the part of the Nexus 5 everyone
is wondering about is the camera which
might be an
megapixel shooter but does feature
optical image stabilization my review of
the nexus 5 is on its way but you can
check out Jace's video giving you
everything you need to know about the
launch and then you can see our articles
at android authority com pitting the
Nexus 5 against a lot of the competition
even the Nexus 4 also at the time of
filming this edition of weekly either
color of the 16 gigabyte model will take
three to four weeks to leave the
warehouse while that 32 gigabyte models
will take two to three if you want to
get your hands on the Nexus 5 as soon as
possible maybe one way you can do it is
by checking out our sunday giveaway for
this week because we are giving one away
the Nexus 5 hardware is not the only
star of the show however as a lot of
Google software acumen has been updated
to go along with it as well we start
with an update to Google Hangouts now
you are able to share your location and
play animated gifts to people you are
chatting with many are very happy
especially with the much anticipated
update to SMS support this is only one
part of the entire picture however and
that picture is of course the newly
minted Android 4.4 KitKat joining a slew
of new optimizations dubbed projects
felt are a lot of cleaned up design
elements and a better and badder Google
search experience now when you are on
your home screens saying okay Google
will bring up a voice-controlled Google
search caller ID now taps into Google
search to provide you the names of
callers that may not be in your phone
book and the phone app will
automatically prioritize your contacts
while searching for nearby businesses
and places that you may be interested in
Joe Hindy our app guy took a very
in-depth look at all that android 4.4
kitkat has to offer so you can
definitely check out that video for our
or our full written article for all of
the details and for those of you who
want to have the nexus 5 experience but
can't get the smartphone just yet many
of the apks from the 4.4 built have been
extracted and made available to the
masses Joe has collected all of these
links and has listed them at android
authority com the new hangouts the Nexus
5 wallpapers and even the Google
Experience launcher are available for
you to check out speaking of the Google
Experience launcher we take a closer
look at Android 4.4 KitKat and finds how
the new launcher is actually basically
just Google search Ars Technica delve
deep into the android 4.4 kitkat bin
old and found that the original Google
home launcher has been done away with
and was replaced with what is
essentially a beefed up google search
essentially everything you see on the
home screens is being drawn from the
google search code google home still
exists but doesn't work without search
installed it's unclear what this might
mean for OEMs who create their own
versions of the android operating system
but at least in the case of the Nexus 5
it's absolutely clear now that this move
allowed for a streamline to search
experience that included features like
the always-on voice control and so there
you have it for this edition of Android
weekly as always thank you guys very
much for watching and like i said before
my nexus 5 is on its way and i can't
wait to get that review out for you guys
