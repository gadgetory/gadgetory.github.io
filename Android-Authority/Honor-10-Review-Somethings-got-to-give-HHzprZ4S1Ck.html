experiencing something of a shake-up
sales of new devices have slowed down
for the first time in years and
innovation seems to have somewhat
stagnated among the flagships but there
is something interesting happening in
the world of Android and you won't find
it at the higher price end but rather at
the mid-range devices like this on a 10
are in many ways the most exciting
handsets on the market today they don't
have any kind of big feature or gimmick
here we find that what you get for your
money is rapidly increasing and the gap
between the premium devices and these
middle-of-the-road errs is rapidly
decreasing what's the big new feature to
be excited about in 2018 the price the
honour 10 is the perfect example of this
and on paper it sounds almost flagship
for a fraction of the price it just 399
pounds here in the UK but can it really
compete with your Galaxy S 9s and your
Huawei P 20s
I'm Adam Snitsky and I'm going to find
out in this full review stay tuned
comparing the honor 10 to the Huawei P
20 is rather apt of course honor is a
subdivision of Huawei and actually in
many ways while way is cannibalizing its
own sales in this way so to look at
right away the honor 10 is very similar
to the Huawei P 20 the thing you're
going to notice of course is that aurora
glass which is all over the back and
that gives it a really shimmering shiny
the eye catching look this is made by
stacking 15 different layers of glass on
top of each other which then bounce
light back in different ways depending
on the angle that you're looking at it I
do imagine this won't be to everyone's
taste it is a little bit ostentatious
you might find a little bit garish but
like I say it's different it stands out
and that's a good thing and if you go
for like the glacier gray and that's a
little less noticeable and of course it
can always take a case a ver anyways but
it is nice that this is a device that
you know it's a bit different stands out
from the crowd on the front you've got
an IPS LCD display
it's 5.8 4 inches and 1080 by to 280 P
the screen looks really nice
it's colourful especially if you leave
it in the default vivid mode not quite
up there with an AMOLED display of
course the blacks aren't quite as black
but definitely serviceable more than
serviceable in fact very pleasant to
watch
Media or play games on the biggest
downfall for me is that it's not covered
in gorilla glass this covered instead in
some kind of proprietary protective
glass and to me it just feels a bit more
plasticy and in fact that's one of my
complaints with the device here in
general it feels a bit plasticky it is
made of glass but it just it's a bit
Hollow and it doesn't quite have that
premium heft that you'll get from more
expensive devices which is fair enough
for the price I'm not saying it's
horrible I'm just saying you can feel
the price difference a little bit when
you pick it up I'm also not a big fan of
the haptics there's a motor in here that
buzzes when you're typing and for
notifications and it's so distracting
and so loud
that I can't use it next to my wife in
bed while she's sleeping because it
distracts her and wakes her up it's got
really thin bezels and 19 by 9 aspect
ratio a very modern design in that
regard but of course it does have that
notch and this is going to be divisive
for a lot of people I have been
surprised just how much some people
dislike the knotch but the good news is
that you can turn this off in the
settings create a black bar on either
side to hide it and whilst you can still
make it out it's basically gone so I
can't see a big reason to be that
unhappy with it based up to you whether
or not this is off-putting but for me
personally it's not and I think most
people are going to be fine with it what
is a little bit of a strange choice is
that there's a fingerprint sensor down
the bottom of the display so it's got a
bit of a chin and that seems a little
bit odd when you've gone to all those
lengths to remove the bezel at the top
and then you leave the bezel down the
bottom what that fingerprint sensor is
there is a ultrasonic fingerprint sensor
so it's something a bit different this
is supposed to be faster and it supposed
to work even when your fingers are wet
personally I find this actually a bit
slower than your regular fingerprint
sensors and seeing as there's no IP
rating on this I don't really know what
the benefit of being able to open it
with wet fingers is you can open it with
wet fingers but you can't take it into a
wet place otherwise the design is no
fireworks no disasters you have a
headphone jack which is good news for a
lot of people you have the speaker
grille down the bottom a single one easy
to cover up with your finger but loud
enough I will say it's a bit quieter
than several of the other mid-range
devices I've used recently especially
with notifications actually in
Cole's not the call volume itself but me
the ringing of the phone is a bit quiet
and I've missed a couple of calls as a
result of course you can turn it right
up but it just doesn't go quite as loud
as I'd like it to but it's perfectly
fine it will fill a room you can have it
on watching YouTube watch it cook in the
kitchen no problem
meanwhile the performance day is in many
ways right up there with flagships and
the big reason for this is that it's
powered by the ki-rin 970 chipset this
is the top of the range Kirin at the
moment and it's the same one found in
the Huawei P 20 so you're literally
getting the same performance in that
regard as you do from Wiley's own
flagship so I mean about cannibalizing
sales it's an interesting strategy but
with the state of the smartphone market
right now it makes a lot of sense so
that of course means that you're gonna
get top of the range of performance and
you'll have no problem playing all the
latest games 3d games on the Play Store
at the same time it will nip through the
UI perfectly quickly although with some
caveats more on that in a second but
it's not quite up there with the
Snapdragon 835 when it comes to gaming
performance which is roughly the
equivalent and it's certainly not quite
up there with the 845 so the Snapdragon
is essentially a generation ahead of
Kirin right now so although it is the
latest available it's not the very best
performance but it's right up them for
399 pounds you really can't complain
about the performance here it's backed
up by four gigabytes of RAM or in India
there's also a six gigabyte variant
available I believe what whywe really
likes to talk about when it comes to the
ki-rin 970 is that NPU the new or
processing unit this allows it to
perform on board artificial intelligence
and machine learning so it can be things
like recognize things in the scene
smarter memory management based on the
way used the device even organize your
photos so are we talking more about that
as it relates to the camera in a moment
but that's one advantage of having that
kevin-97 the face unlock feature is
super quick I think it's really good
actually one of the best and I'd say
that probably comes down to that NPU so
in many ways this is a top performing
smartphone for just 399,000 mic against
performance slightly is the addition of
mui or emotion UI this is an android
skin that's on top of android 8.1 and it
changes the look for starters which a
lot of people don't like it's very
colorful and very garish but fortunate
you can change this by installing a
separate launcher and doing other
customizations but at the same time I
think it also hurts the performance and
you notice this when doing things like
swiping through the image gallery or I
noticed a bit of a stutter which I don't
think would have been there otherwise
considering the chipset this is running
that said he knew I'd does have its
benefits for instance it's apparently
very good with memory management I find
that it's a little bit aggressive in
that regard actually but again it's a
matter of opinion it's also got some
cool gestures for instance a one-handed
mode you can swipe to the right and then
everything shrinks down you can navigate
to easily like that that's quite useful
there are other gestures and knuckle
gesture and things so you might like you
know why some people do personally I
would have preferred something closer to
stock the battery is two thousand four
hundred million powers and that's
perfectly fine to see for a day in most
cases I haven't had any problems there
my average screen on time is just under
six hours which is fairly standard there
is quick charging but no wireless
charging despite this being a glass
device and that brings us to the camera
it's a 16 megapixel primary shooter
backed up by 24 megapixel monochrome
lens and on has been doing this for a
long time the idea of that monochrome
lens is to increase the dynamic range to
provide more data to feed into those
images and I would say it probably works
pretty well because the contrast is good
there's good variation between colors
and on the whole I'm pretty happy with
the way photos turn out so an F 1.8
aperture so you can do those nice depth
of field effects and actually control
the aperture in the pro mode as well as
in the aperture mode and then at the
front you've got 24 megapixel camera
which is really generous really high
definition for a selfie camera what
everyone's talking about when it comes
to this camera or what on a once ever
want to be talking about is the AI
capabilities this is an AI camera it
says so proudly right across the back
and what that means is that if you point
this camera or something it will
recognize what's in the shot and it will
change the settings accordingly so that
means if you point it at food it's gonna
maybe change the setting so that there's
greater detail if you point to it
flowers it might turn up them saturation
not actually more true to life though
it's just what your phone thinks is
better so it really depends on just
whether you agree with the AI whether
the AI likes what you like really gonna
love this you're going to
the good news is you can turn it off if
you don't like it and it's still cool to
have just a toy around with this a neat
party trick
unfortunately there's no optical image
stabilization but there is e is and this
works really well actually it's one of
the best implementations of EAS I've
seen probably once again you're getting
some benefit from that ai functionality
low-light performance is really good as
well even though it loses some of the
low-light features found on the Huawei
p20 it's not a perfect story here though
I will say that the autofocus isn't
particularly good on this camera
sometimes images end up looking a bit
soft I will say that this isn't quite a
flagship camera it's not going to
compete with you know pixel two but it
is a really good camera it's capable of
really good shots if you're going to
work at it and the reason that I like
this camera more than a lot of other
cameras with similar specs or similar
performance is that it's got so much to
play around with you've got light
painting for instance which I absolutely
love you've got an artist mode so yeah
there's just a lot to play around with
it's a really fun camera I really like
that about it I like that about all on
the phones so yeah on the whole this is
a fun device but at the same time it's
also a really impressive device in terms
of what you're getting for the money I
didn't want to point out some of the
flaws and nitpick a little but like I
say those are nitpicks
I want you to know what it's like to use
that isn't quite as premium as a
top-of-the-range device but anything on
top of what you're getting here is a
luxury so there's no one needs to spend
more than that the performance and what
you can do with it is right up there
with the best on the market and that's
really quite incredible it's gonna be
really interesting to see how those
top-of-the-range flagships can compete
with this kind of value and what they're
going to do to justify those massive
prices Google Samsung Apple it's your
move the only problem is that there's at
least two other devices that also offer
incredible value for money these days
around this price point those being the
nokia 7 plus and the 1 plus 6 so stay
tuned for comparison videos looking at
how they stack up so yeah what do you
think is this the start of a new era are
we gonna start seeing smartphone prices
fall or more importantly what do you
think of the honor 10 let me know in the
