of the year and also the follow-up to a
phone that made us all reevaluate the
prices and value that we give our smart
phones especially when we consider the
contracts they sometimes come with and
of course it is the gateway to a
quintessential Android experience a
charge of agar from Android thority
what's going on everybody and this is
the full review of the Google Nexus 5
how about we just jump right into the
review and talk about the design the
Nexus 5 comes with a very minimalistic
profile which is definitely the best way
to describe the overall design aspect on
the front we have the black slate design
with the 4.9 five-inch screen and below
it is the notification LED light which
is reminiscent of the Galaxy Nexus from
before up top we do have the 1.3
megapixel front-facing camera right next
to a phone speaker grille that is
actually perforated now this is a bit of
a unique design choice that I personally
like even if it's not really
recognizable right off the bat on the
right side there is the power button on
top of the SIM tray now this power
button might be a little bit higher up
on the device than I would have liked
because yet to sort of reach for it and
adjust your hand just to find it however
that's a really nitpicky thing opposite
the power button however are the volume
rockers now all of these buttons have a
real meaty feel to them and they are
quite rigid so if you are looking for
the buttons without having to look at
your phone you should have no problem
feeling for them we make it around the
back and find all of the nice feeling
soft touch plastic and a couple design
choices that were originally found in
the Nexus 7 we do have the Nexus logo in
landscape which is something I really
like and then the large camera lens unit
that houses the optical image
stabilization that this camera boasts
one thing that did surprise me about the
Nexus 5 however is how light it is I
expected there to be at least a little
bit of weight for a phone that had a
nearly 5 inch screen however once I
picked it up it seemed as light as a
feather
this is definitely one of the Nimbus
phones that I have ever used and despite
having that 5 inch screen it is still
easy to get around all of the elements
on the screen with its lightness and
also its understated design which i
think is more of a strong suit than a
weak point
the Nexus 5 definitely feels like a
small box of lightning in my hand
especially when you consider everything
that it's capable of power on the phone
and you get to enjoy that near 5 inch
screen capable of 1080p resolution at
445 PPI LG is no stranger when it comes
to great displays and the Nexus 5 is no
exception this IPS screen brings some
pretty beautiful quality and I'm
actually inclined to keep the default
stock Android wallpaper set because it
shows just how vivid the colors can be
through this screen on top of all of
that however you do get crisp and sharp
text along with some really nice
contrast due to some deeper blacks aside
from that the handling of the screen is
also quite nice as the bezels around it
are very respectable but the top and
bottom bezels make it easy to use this
phone in landscape mode all in all we're
looking at a pretty stellar screen that
is capable of a lot and deserves to be
on a device like the Nexus 5 especially
considering its price point the
performance aspect of this phone is a
welcomed case of low compromises as the
Nexus 5 comes with the Snapdragon 800
clocked in at 2.3 gigahertz the audrina
330 and 2 gigabytes of ram coupled with
the optimizations that were put into
KitKat it is no surprise that the Nexus
5 absolutely flies through all of its
elements when I'm really trying to get a
lot of things done at once using the
newly enhanced recent apps screen along
with all of these optimizations and
smooth transitions really make my
experience seem very seamless this may
truly be one of the smoothest and best
experiences of android available on any
smartphone today so it is undoubtedly a
big point in the plus category for the
Nexus 5 as we have come to expect from
Nexus devices don't learn too many extra
bells and whistles the Nexus 5 comes in
two flavors black or white but also in
16 or 32 gigabytes of on-board storage
that are not expandable any user of the
next four that really missed their 4G
connectivity can look to the Nexus 5 for
full LTE support I used it on the AT&amp;amp;T
network and I have to say having LTE on
a phone like this is definitely
definitely a big plus another feature
that returns from the Nexus 4 is Qi
wireless charging now that you can use a
plethora
different mats for it you might have one
lying around so go ahead and bust that
out and start charging your phone
wirelessly by laying your phone right on
it one of the more disappointing parts
of the hardware aspect is in the
speakers and the sound quality that they
make yes the speakers have been
relocated to the bottom of the phone
which is kind of a nice change actually
however the sound itself still lacks
some dimension and to be honest it still
doesn't get as loud as we would really
want and then we come to the battery
which is a twenty three hundred million
power unit however despite it being kind
of small we all did put our faith into
the Nexus and the fact that android
kitkat was going to come with a lot of
power setting optimizations
unfortunately when it comes to this
execution on the Nexus 5 this is only
kind of the case you should still get
about a decent day's work out of this
phone however despite all of that it is
when you ramp up your usage that you
start to see very easily diminishing
returns while one day I was able to go
from waking up to sleeping without the
Nexus 5 getting below 20% of battery
life I will admit that almost half of
that day was spent with the Nexus 5 just
sitting in my pocket and then the next
day I did go for about eight hours
ramping my usage up to about moderately
heavy doing everything from low
intensive tasks to extended gaming and
after the end of those eight hours I had
the battery life down to about thirty to
twenty five percent now for the real
power user that is definitely a bit of a
disappointment while there will be
plenty of times when the longevity works
perfectly for you there might be just as
many other times that it'll be a big
disappointment and you won't like the
power or lack thereof that you're
getting from the Nexus 5 and then we
move forward to the camera which is an 8
megapixel shooter on the back packed
with optical image stabilization which
pretty much explains why the lens unit
is so large as far as the app goes it is
the stock Android app that is very
minimalistic I will say however that
these touch and swipe menus are a little
bit cumbersome you definitely have to
get used to them and it's only then that
you will have a real comfortable time
navigating all of your settings of
course it always comes down to the
picture quality when it comes to the
Nexus 5 we were hoping
it would blow the Nexus floor out of the
water and in this respect it definitely
does however when it comes to picture
quality in general the Nexus 5 is only
average again at best when you have a
really great lighting like let's say in
broad daylight you get a generally good
picture we do see that the HDR plus does
a much better job of processing all of
the colors and provides you a much
better picture with that in mind you may
want to keep hdr+ on well pretty much
all the time as light diminishes so does
the quality of the photo at least in
most cases I will say however though
that the OIS built into the camera does
do its job and floods more light in its
just the quality of that picture that
comes out of the shot that is a little
bit lackluster one great feature about
the OIS is that the videos get
stabilized as well as you are recording
videos if you're trying to be steady
already the OIS will help you out even
more and provide you with a pretty damn
smooth video and if you're not trying
that hard OS will definitely compensate
for the jerking is that you might have
and when you're holding your phone all
in all the Nexus 5 camera is far from
its biggest disappointment but it also
doesn't necessarily amaze us that being
said it's still not a bad tool to have
in your pocket when you need to take a
quick shot wherever you are and finally
we make it over to software in which we
find the newest version of Android 4.4
KitKat
which was probably just as anticipated
as the Nexus 5 smartphone itself when
you first power on Android and get right
in there you'll find some pretty obvious
changes right off the bat the main one
being that Google now is now a second
home screen all the way on the left and
you can also access it by just saying OK
Google and the way the transitions are
with the optimizations put into kicad
make this a very smooth process and it
just feels very fast and very nice
you'll also notice more transparency in
the notification bar up top and in the
bar that houses the soft keys at the
bottom all of these bars also move away
when you're using particular functions
like reading a book or playing a game
also when you're in those functions you
can swipe down from the top that way the
notification bar will appear for you to
check if you have any new messages or
notifications easily
as far as general design is concerned
there's definitely a flatter profile to
everything inside of Android 4.4 kitkat
and there's a bit of a bubbliness that
has been added in there as well as you
can see in the bottom more than where
the app drawer icon is I have some
slight concerns about that because I
didn't want my stock android to become
cartoonish however after some time with
the phone I really don't find that to be
the case anymore and the phone dialer
app has been given the ability of search
as well if you have a number that you
have to find for a business or if you
just want to figure out if there's
something nearby for you you can use the
dialer app and just add in a couple
words and it will search nearby for
those things however I think by far my
favorite addition to KitKat has to be in
the lockscreen when you're listening to
music you get fullscreen album art it's
a great contextual way of changing your
phone based on what you're listening to
and it just is really cool and really
nice Android has come a long way and
KitKat is a beautiful beautiful example
of that not only is it a simplistically
elegant interface it's transitions and
downright speed just make it feel like
everything you're doing takes up no time
at all and finally we come to the price
which is probably one of the most
attractive parts of the Nexus 5 for $349
unlocked
you get the base 16 gigabyte model and a
gateway into one of the best experiences
on a smartphone that you might have this
year and so there you have it the Nexus
5 like I said before it just feels like
lightning in a box the concessions made
on the smartphone might bum you out a
little bit but you have to keep in mind
that price point in a lot of different
respects the Nexus 5 absolutely excels
and it almost feels like the price
should be a lot higher for a phone that
performs just as well as this all in all
you have to look at the Nexus 5 as a
total package and as a package it is
very attractive
the reason being because for that price
point for an unlocked phone it gives you
the essentials it gives you everything
that you need without much fuss at all
