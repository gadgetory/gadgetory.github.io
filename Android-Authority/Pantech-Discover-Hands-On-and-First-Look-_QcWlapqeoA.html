calm i'm here with shaundra Thompson
from pantech to talk about the new
discovery discover phone on AT&amp;amp;T can you
tell us a little bit about the device a
little bit about the hardware specs and
some features on the phone we believe
this is our most impressive phone to
date it comes with a four point eight
inch HD touchscreen display with a 1280
by 720 pixel resolution it also has a 12
point 6 megapixel camera on the rear and
a 2 megapixel camera on the front so
it's great for video chatting and
self-portraits the other cool feature we
like about the heart where the device it
comes with dual side mounted 3d surround
sound speakers they're really big
speakers and they put out an incredible
sound the device is also NFC enabled so
it allows you to share content between
other NFC enabled devices you can read
the programmable smart tags and you it's
also unable to support the Isis mobile
claimant payment platform at ATT is
launching in the market today great yes
he tell us a little bit about some of
the aspects of the user interface I see
that you can theme the the dialer and
the the lock screen and so forth
customize a little bit to your liking
yes now well we first introduced the
pantech exclusive easy experience on the
Pentek flex that we launched last
September we also have it on a pen deck
pentek discover and because it's a
larger screen it just makes it a more
enhanced experience for the end user we
also have our own custom UI overlay over
the android ice cream sandwich OS and so
it has a quick settings menu where you
can customize your widgets your
wallpapers it has tips and direct access
to your settings menu so you can get
into your settings in and out very
quickly the other cool thing that we
have an extended launcher bar so as you
know what Ice Cream Sandwich you can get
up to seven home screen panels so if
you're on that last panel but you're
using YouTube frequently you can use
that extended launcher bar to put the
apps on it the ones that you use the
most on a more frequent basis now when
is this going to be available this will
be available on January 11th and the
two-year contract is 49
and what is the fool out right retail
cost it will be 399 great a contract now
shaundra what other features as a
discover have okay our device the
pantech discover is the first device on
a tts network that comes preloaded with
the ATT drive mode app and that it
that's an app that helps curve texting
and driving and what it does is it sends
auto reply text to all incoming texts
and phone call messages to your mobile
phone mobile phone so you can
concentrate on driving while you're on
the road and not be tempted to text and
not be distracted while you're driving
the other thing that's cool about the
pantech discovers it's also the first
device that does full VPN and EAS
support so now it has secure encrypted
access for corporate intranets and email
so now this is the device it's
definitely a good option for business
professionals oh yeah definitely
business customers will definitely love
that option to be able to VPN into work
so they can get their work documents and
so forth yeah that's great that's great
oh no I noticed uh that the device has a
very very slim of battery in it what
what size battery is that it's a 2100
mAh battery and that allows you get up
to 10 hours of talktime and 430 hours of
standby time so you can go from work to
play on a single charge that's great all
