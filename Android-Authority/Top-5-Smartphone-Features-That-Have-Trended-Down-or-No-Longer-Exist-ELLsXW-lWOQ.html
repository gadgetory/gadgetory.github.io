features that come with them and some
stick around for a really long time
some disappear because they're not all
that popular and some fade away into
obscurity because we find better and
more efficient ways of doing things so
with that being said let's take a look
at the top five smartphone features that
have either trended down or no longer
exist so kicking off the list at number
one is the physical keyboard and back
one capacitive touchscreens weren't
quite as prevalent physical keyboards
were everywhere we had BlackBerry's and
we also had the t-mobile Sidekick line
which was extremely popular and then we
had other phones like the Palm Pre but
with the introduction of the touchscreen
this did have an effect on the existence
of physical keyboards now physical
keyboards did not disappear right away
with the capacitive touchscreen in fact
a lot of the really early Android phones
had a capacitive touchscreen and a
physical keyboard the very first Android
phone the t-mobile g1 had a physical
keyboard the Motorola Droid series of
phones the Samsung Epic 4G Touch for
Sprint and a bunch of different other
phones had physical keyboards but as
capacitive touchscreens got better and
the virtual typing experiences on them
got better the need for a physical
keyboard sort of started to diminish
another reason why physical keyboards
also disappeared was the race for the
thinnest smartphone and as smartphones
were getting thinner there just wasn't
any room for a physical keyboard so the
physical keyboard had to go bye-bye now
physical keyboards aren't necessarily
dead obviously it's still around one of
the more recent Android phones that came
out this year the BlackBerry key one has
a physical keyboard but I highly doubt
that one Android phone with the physical
keyboard is all of a sudden going to
cause a resurgence in physical keyboards
number two is the trackball / trackpad
and this was another feature that was
very heavily impacted by the existence
of the capacitive touchscreen now on a
non touchscreen device the trackball was
basically your primary source of
navigation it was
it was quick it was convenient and much
faster than using a directional pad now
trackballs did not go away entirely when
the capacitive touchscreen was
introduced they did hang around for a
little while the same way physical
keyboards hung around for a little while
the very first Android phone again the
t-mobile g1 had a trackball the very
first Nexus phone the Nexus One had a
trackball but on a touchscreen device
trackballs had a much different purpose
your finger became your primary source
of navigation and the only time you ever
really used a trackball was when your
finger just wasn't accurate or precise
enough like moving a cursor through a
block of text or copying and pasting but
eventually software for copying pasting
and moving a cursor around got a lot
better and the trackball just became a
little bit unnecessary now before the
trackball disappeared it turned into an
optical trackpad because trackballs had
a higher rate of failure and we saw
trackpads
on phones like the Droid Incredible and
the HTC legend but eventually this
feature went away because capacitive
touchscreens were just a lot better a
lot easier a lot faster and more
convenient next up on the list is
front-facing speakers and front-facing
speakers still exist so this follows
more on D trending down side of things
but the first company that you probably
think of when you think of front-facing
speakers is HTC because they basically
pioneered front-facing speakers with the
One m7 back in the day and this feature
trickled over to the more mid-range
desired lineup and then ultimately other
OEMs adopted this feature as well we had
motorola with the Nexus 6 and then while
way the following year with the 6p and
then other companies like ZTE what's
axon 7 and Alcatel what their Idol
series of phones all had front-facing
speakers but if you take a look back at
the last year-and-a-half or you take a
look at 2016 there were more smartphones
with single speakers than there were
with dual front-facing speakers and even
HTC themselves dropped front-facing
speakers entirely for a different
speaker setup and I think one of the
biggest reasons why front-facing
speakers haven't exactly exploded in the
smartphone world is because a lot of the
really big name om never adopted this
feature at all Samsung LG and if you
want to throw in Apple none of these
companies ever took on front-facing
eaters on any of their smartphones and
if they did front-facing speakers
definitely would have been a lot bigger
now it is possible that front-facing
speakers may be trending upwards because
there are rumors that the pixel too will
have front-facing speakers but as of
right now front-facing speakers are
definitely not as common as we thought
they initially were going to be number
four is removable batteries and
removable batteries have more or less
gone the way of the dinosaurs Samsung
and LG held on to this feature for a
really long time but the unibody design
trend eventually took over and put an
end to the removable battery now if you
dig really deep and you look at super
super cheap budget Android phones you
can probably still find a smart phone
with a removable battery but for the
most part it really no longer exists
another reason why this trend has gone
away is because a lot of phones now are
water and dust resistant and it's a lot
easier to make a phone with a unibody
design water and dust tight versus a
phone with a removable back and battery
now it is possible to make those phones
water and dust resistant as well because
Samsung did do it with the Galaxy s5 and
the s4 active but there's a higher
chance of failure with those phones
because they can come apart and Samsung
actually did have that issue with the s4
active now one of the biggest benefits
of having a removable battery is that
you can easily swap in a fresh one and
instantly get a full charge but with
technologies like fast charging getting
better and better and battery packs
becoming a dime a dozen having this
feature on smartphones isn't really
necessary anymore last but not least is
the headphone jack and the removal of
the headphone jack has been quite the
hot topic and while there's still a lot
of smart phones out there with a
headphone jack it's hard to deny that
this feature is trending down one of the
biggest reasons for this is because of
USB type-c USB type-c is supposed to be
our one and only port for everything and
a lot of OEMs have already maybe
transitioned away from the headphone
jack Apple being one of the biggest and
most obvious ones but we also have
companies like HTC and Motorola and it's
only a matter of time before other
big-name OMS like Samsung and LG follow
suit there's also some pretty heavy
rumors right now that Google is going to
be removing the headphone jack from the
next pixel and if a big company like
Google is removing the headphone jack
that's only going to further solidify
that the headphone jack is slowly being
phased out so that rounds out the top
five list but this list would not be
complete without some honorable mentions
remember the IR blaster the IR blaster
used to be on a ton of smart phones
Samsung LG and HTC all used IR blasters
but now none of these companies use our
blasters so rest in peace to the IR
blaster it was fun while it lasted but
now you're nothing but a blast from the
past
remember phones with stereoscopic 3d
like the HTC EVO 3d or the LG thrille
these phones actually had 3d displays
and they had dual cameras on the back
before Google cameras was even a thing
to capture 3d images and these phones
came out when 3d was really booming at
the time there was a lot of 3d movies
coming out in theaters there was also a
lot of 3d TV so I guess smart phone om
thought to be a good idea to bring this
technology to smart phones and it turned
out to be one of the biggest flops in
smartphone history and it pretty much
disappeared about as fast as it was
introduced but that's going to do it for
