weekly show is brought to you by WAC
magic to the hello again ladies and
gentlemen I'm Joe Hindy the android
authority app guy and welcome back to
android apps weekly this is episode
number 131 so let's get started legend
of zelda twilight princess was brief
made for the wii u and released this
last week in celebration for the next
few days at least link will adorn google
maps instead of the usual pointer icon
it's a fun little way to celebrate the
series especially since its celebrated
its 30-year anniversary late last month
instagram is the latest social network
to begin blocking links from other
social media services from now on links
to snapchat and telegram should stop
functioning and instagram posts and
you'll receive a little message to let
you know if you try most other social
media sites are still accepted at least
for now spotify has always used facebook
as its social media of choice and now it
seems facebook is tapping spotify
facebook Messenger will soon have
spotify integration you'll be able to
access it from the menu and then share
your favorite songs directly over the
service it's a bit clunky but it's also
a new feature that will likely be
updated over time it's true for right
now that Apple pay leads both Samsung
and Android when it comes to the whole
pay thing however new data suggests that
Samsung pay is actually growing at a
faster rate than Apple pay and should
overtake them eventually Apple pay is
still growing quickly but no one is
quite sure yet if it's growing faster
than Apple pay or not google has updated
their Play Store terms to address
advertisements by penalizing
applications that have ads that prevent
people from using the app along with
that there are new rules against
bypassing doze mode against collecting
user data and appropriately and a whole
lot more we should see a cleaner google
play store soon for even more Android
apps and games news don't forget to
check out this week's newsletter which
is linked in the video description below
there you'll find all of the headlines
new releases and updates that we didn't
have space for here if you're so
inclined you can subscribe using the
form which is in the written companion
which is also linked in the video
description below and we'll send it to
you every Sunday ok folks is take a look
at the apps and games that made a big
splash this week as usual if you want to
check out any of these apps or games you
can find those links in the video
description below thumb drift is a fun
little racer
that features retro graphics and one
finger swipe controls which makes it
ridiculously easy to play you'll be
drifting around corners quite often
trying to get the high score and there
are 50 vehicles that you can unlock it
also features leaderboards so you can
challenge your friends if you so choose
it's easy it's accessible and it's free
to download there are worst games to
whip out while you're standing in line
at the movie theater hands-free is a new
application from google that tries to
change how we pay for things the
application works by connecting to cash
your terminals over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi
and then pays the bill as long as you
state that you want to pay with Google
the application then send your photo to
the register where your identity is
verified and the purchases pushed
through it's an entertaining idea
although there aren't many places that
can take advantage of it just yet
Fahrenheit also known as indigo prophecy
was originally released back in 2005 and
had a loyal cult following the game has
been remastered and re-released on
mobile in all of its glory the title
classifieds itself as an interactive
narrative playing more like a movie that
the gamer controls rather than just a
game it looks good and seems like it's
going to be a fun ride is a tad
expensive at nine dollars and
ninety-nine cents but there are also no
in-app purchases pound is the personal
assistant application from SoundHound
that's been in beta since its initial
announcement last year it has come out
of beta and is now available for
everyone without an invite the personal
assistant features a quirky side that
likes to tell jokes and play games and
you can also use one of the many voice
commands to do things like get an uber
driver check out the weather check
reviews of a restaurant and many many
more it's a good third-party personal
assistant and it's definitely worth a
shot the clash Royale is the latest game
out of supercell developers of the
critically acclaimed clash of clans this
is a card collector where you collect
cards and then use them in duels to beat
other players every round is live PvP
and you'll be battling for trophies the
characters and cards are all themed from
clash of clans to give fans a familiar
setting it's meant to take on har stone
in the dueling cards game type and I
guess we'll see if it works this week's
episode of the android apps weekly show
is sponsored by whack magic to this
unique whack-a-mole game picks you up
against various monsters that you'll
have to take down you'll be tapping
holding and swiping to perform various
attacks based on the enemies to take
them down as quickly as possible within
the given time limits there
also RPG elements as your character
levels up and gets more powerful over
time your hero can be equipped and
upgraded with armor and weapons to make
them more powerful and you can find
power-ups special abilities and more to
help along the way it really is a fun
little game and a pleasant way to spend
