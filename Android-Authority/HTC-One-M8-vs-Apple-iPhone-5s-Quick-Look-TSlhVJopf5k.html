smartphone you're probably looking at
two of the best that are available today
hey it's Joshua regard from Android
thority of what's going on everybody and
this is the HTC One m8 versus the iPhone
5s now in the Android world the HTC One
m8 and its predecessor are probably the
closest you'd get to matching the build
quality of the iPhone 5s both feature
metal bodies with the iPhone favoring a
much more angular design compared to the
curves and now the very smooth corners
and sides of the HTC One m8 the iPhone
comes with its signature physical home
button this time with an integrated
fingerprint scanner as well while on the
other hand HTC has done away with the
capacitive keys that used to be a big
part of the front face of HTC
smartphones entirely and now are going
for software keys you do still get that
big black bar across the bottom of the
phone and above the speaker this time
housing just the HTC logo but apart from
the similar build quality these are
obviously two very different smartphones
especially when it comes to the size and
screen real estate speaking of those
screens there really isn't anything
wrong with the IPS LCD display of the
iPhone 5s as it does have accurate color
reproduction has good brightness and
great viewing angles but even the
one-inch difference in size makes the
display of the HTC One m8 a much higher
pixel density and of course vivid colors
and fantastic viewing angles in that
1080p screen and considering that
smartphones nowadays double as media
consumption devices it's a little
difficult to get over how small the
display of the iPhone 5s is along with
it's much over lower overall resolution
to boot and of course that additional
display real estate obviously is a big
plus in our book as far as performance
goes iOS is known for its fluid
animations impressive optimizations and
is generally a starter free experience
and while iOS 7 did have its issues with
performance things have seemed to have
gotten better with the recent 7.1
updates now the HTC One m8 features the
best processing package that is
currently available in the smartphone
today and with HTC Sense getting even
lighter sleeker and better performance
is as smooth as ever on this new
iteration with both smartphones overall
performance is one area where there
should be no issues which is nothing
short of what you would expect from
flagship smartphones anyway
and when we move onto hardware we will
find that a by-the-numbers breakdown of
the specifications is quite unfair as
the HTC One m8 obviously has the better
specs with the faster processor more RAM
and a much larger battery but these two
devices cater to completely different
ecosystems and in the end the lower
specs of the iPhone 5s don't translate
to poor performance overall but one
benefit that the HTC One m8 does have is
its inclusion of expandable storage
which is always a welcome addition and
something that HTC has decided to
reintroduce after a while and then of
course the HTC One m8 also comes with
that dual front-facing boom sound
speaker set up making the HTC One one of
the best media consumption devices
available especially since the sound
coming out of those speakers is actually
very surprisingly and very welcoming
leak rate and then in the camera as we
find that the eight megapixel rear
shooter of the iPhone 5s has been widely
known for taking some great quality
images while the HTC One m7 from last
year did somewhat have a few issues with
its camera but that should be a lot
better now with the current version just
released both smartphones feature dual
LED flashes and the HTC One m8 also gets
a second rear shooter made for a
hardware based solution to depth of
field shots not only does that duo
camera take the depth of field data from
a picture it is also a very fast
performance that eliminates the
processing time that software based
solutions cater to the HTC One m8 camera
also does come with a lot of software
features as well such as Zowie and while
it's probably not as feature packed as
let's say the Samsung Galaxy line it
definitely offers more than you would
get with the iPhone 5s and it's more
rigid and less feature pack design HTC's
updates to the front camera as well I'll
provide an even better experience which
now comes with a 5 megapixel sensor and
an 88 degree wide angle lens now iOS
received an important overhaul last year
with the introduction of some key
changes like a quick settings menu and
an overall upgrade to the design
aesthetics resulting in a brighter more
colorful UI granted the basic idea still
hasn't really changed what the icons
still being available just on the home
screens and there are real no
customization options available but with
sense 6.0 an HTC scamp blinkfeed makes a
return as a second screen when you swipe
left
and over all the icons and colors are
still about the same with the generally
more flattened tone down design a couple
years ago the sense knew I was
incredibly bloated but with sense 5 and
now 6 the company has done a lot to get
it back on track a number of different
gesture based enhancements are
introduced in the HTC One m8 such as the
ability to double tap to wake the device
or swipe to directly enter blink feet or
even some apps overall sense does bring
a more simplistic outlook to what is
still a very full-featured experience
and you can say the same about iOS as
well however when it comes to the flavor
of Apple iOS or Android that is a
decision that is up to you to make and
so there you have it for this quick look
at the HTC One m8 versus the Apple
iPhone 5s you do have two very different
ecosystems here but if you're looking
for just a metal clad phone well these
are the two that are probably the ones
to beat and when you put them
head-to-head you find that the
experiences are a very robust on either
one depending on what you really want
you can find probably a great experience
in either camp the HTC One m8 is a very
exciting release indeed and we can't
wait to put it through its paces
especially when it comes to that camera
so keep it tuned to Andrew 30 for all of
that and the best coverage available
