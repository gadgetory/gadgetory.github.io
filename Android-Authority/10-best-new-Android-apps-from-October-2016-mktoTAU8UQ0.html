handy the Android authority app guy and
we're nearing the end of October that
means it's time to round up the best new
Android apps that were released over the
last month as usual if you want to check
out any of these apps for yourself you
can find those links in the video
description below
Firefox aurora is kind of like a
developer channel for Firefox it works
just like the Firefox browser does
however it'll also include all of the
features that haven't been released to
the stable version yet it's a good way
to try out the more experimental builds
of the browser it works well in terms of
performance but there were some bugs
here and there it's free to download and
try out if you're interested you will
almost certainly run into bugs though
but you can report them to Firefox to
help the build become even better gift
ECAM is a Jif camera it allows you to
take a series of photographs or video
that are then turned into a jiff you'll
also have tons of extra features to play
with including stickers special effects
text and frames you can tap the record
button to do a burst mode jiff or you
can hold the button down to record
something a little smoother it's
probably the best Jif camera available
in the Google Play Store right now and
it's also completely free Google
released of the Chrome Canary app this
month much like Firefox Aurora this is a
super experimental build of Google
Chrome you'll be able to test out the
very latest tweaks and features before
even the dev channel version of Google
Chrome it works pretty well and it
managed to load every webpage that we
threw at it however we did experience
the occasional hang-up or freeze the
builds are completely untested which
means that there will definitely be bugs
you'll also get very frequent updates
it's a fun experience if you want to see
the latest google chrome features ivy
bar is a side bar application that
allows you to quickly see your apps you
can have it launched from either the
right side or the left side of the
screen depending on your preferences and
it is customizable to suit your
individual tastes on top of that the
application has an RSS feature that can
show you news across the bottom of the
screen the RSS feature could use a
little work but it could be useful for
general stuff in its current form the
application itself still needs a bit of
work because there are some bugs but on
the plus side it is free to download if
you want to check it out
linked in learning as an application
that tries to educate people it features
many courses on a variety of subjects
including ones for creativity business
management
and others you can complete these
courses and then put a badge on your
profile showing that you've done that
little bit of training you can also
download courses for offline use and
study if you're going somewhere without
an internet connection it's definitely
no Udacity or udemy but it could be
helpful if you need to brush up on some
of the basics Mars bot is the latest
application out of the developers of
Foursquare it's a chat bot that
recommends places for you to go unlike
Google assistant which resides in Google
a low for most people Mars bot resides
in a text conversation that means you
can use it with whatever SMS app that
you happen to be using at the time the
application itself will keep an eye on
your location and recommend the right
things to you it's a fairly big drain on
the battery if left up to its own
devices but it does indeed work it's
free to use if you're into this sort of
thing playboy released an official
magazine application you can purchase
and view individual issues of the
magazine for a fee alternatively you can
subscribe for $17.99 per year and get
every single issue the application
itself works pretty well although it
seems to be better suited for tablets
than it is for smartphones the settings
menu contains a helpful list of all the
controls that you have available and
that does help make it easier to use it
also takes a bit to get used to and
there are some bugs here and there spray
escape is an interesting little camera
application the central premise is that
you have a blase fear you then take
pictures of your surroundings and it
fits into that little blank sphere you
wash rinse and repeat until everything
is filled in there are a number of
commands that allow you to fill the
sphere as you see fit some people love
it others hate it but it's a ton of fun
once you get past all of the bugs it's
completely free to use if you're
interested surfy browser is a new web
browser with a large focus on security
it does web browsing pretty much like
every other web browser and it was able
to handle every website that we threw at
it what makes it special is the ability
to password lock the browser so that
prying eyes can't get in you can also
password lock individual tabs in case
you want to return to your browsing
session later it's an unreleased app
which means you'll likely encounter some
bugs along the way it's free if you want
to give it a shot wallpapers by Google
is one of a couple of pixel applications
to hit the Google Play Store this week
unlike the pixel launcher this one is
available to most devices this app
houses the Google pixel wallpapers and
you'll be able to browse through and
select the ones that you want the
application will even set the wallpaper
for you it can also see existing wall
purrs on your device in case you need to
switch back it's nothing incredible but
it works well and the wallpapers also
look pretty good and that about does it
for this one folks if you want to keep
watching we have the best new android
games of the month linked up there on
the screen and in the video description
below don't forget to check out all of
these applications if you want to give
them a shot and keep it tuned to android
