hindy from android authority calm and
today we'll be taking a closer look at
truck pulling it's a game about truck
pulling and it's available in the Google
Play Store for 99 cents there is a lot
of stuff to look at in the menus
including your garage store options and
extras under garage you can see the
various trucks you own if you click on
them you're taken to a screen where you
can buy upgrades or get a closer look at
the model in the store you can view a
variety of trucks you can buy when you
get enough money which is Arne in game
you can choose from a variety of trucks
in a variety of categories including
stock pro stock two-wheel drive
four-wheel drive and super semi in the
options menu you can choose your game
settings this includes opengl one point
one or two point O anti-aliasing shaders
specular lighting profile name and class
you can switch between these as you
please but some may not work if your
hardware can't handle it extras are
apparently coming soon the game begins
by choosing your class in the beginning
you'll be doing stock and working your
way up to super semi you'll then choose
between county state regional national
or grand national stages then you'll
choose between the venue where
applicable familiar choose the settings
the game will see the condition of the
track so you can choose the appropriate
tire pressure weights and gear once done
it's time to start there are two options
when it comes to view you can drive it
first person view or hit the camera icon
to change the third person view for the
record it's a lot easier in third person
view pulling trucks is very easy to play
from this point you hit the red button
in the center to get the truck moving
and use the left right buttons on the
sides to steer the goal is to get the
truck the full 300 feet to complete the
pole and then finish clean to get an
additional distance at the end thanks
sometimes there is one round another
times there are two you're judged by
distance whoever gets the best distance
wins if you go off the sides you get
disqualified if you don't get the best
distance you don't win first it's easy
as that although surprisingly addictive
is also surprisingly simple pretty much
every round has you dragging something
down a short stretch looking for the
best distance the controls work well the
ability to change your truck settings
adds a strategy element so we gave
gameplay a score of 4 out of 5 the
graphics in this game are and they're
not bad but they're not that good either
everything looks the way it's supposed
to but the developer clearly paid more
attention to how the game plays and how
the game looks that's not necessarily a
bad thing but it's not a good thing
either the only real gripe with the
graphics is the fact that you can drive
off the track and that makes it look a
little cheap fence despite some
graphical complications it is an
improvement over 2d games so we gave the
graphics to score
three out of five this is a very long
game there are hundreds of events to
play so gamers who pick this up with the
full intention of finishing it we
playing for a long time to unlock all
the levels and all the trucks will not
be a task that can be done in one day
however there is very little incentive
to play this game once it's done about
the only replay value at all in the game
comes from trying levels over and over
again to get first place although you
can advance with second or third-place
finishes who doesn't like having a long
list of gold stars next to each event
with that in mind we gave replay value a
score of 3 out of 5 all in all you have
a game that's easy to play with enough
content to last for a while the graphics
aren't the best and once you get done
with the game there is no ascent up to
play again but that shouldn't hinder the
enjoyment of playing the game the first
time obviously if you're hunting two
trucks pulling or truck pulling then you
won't enjoy this game if you're a fan or
you don't know if you'd like it or not
it's definitely worth checking out it's
not the most exciting game out there but
it's still quite enjoyable so we gave it
an overall value of 3.5 out of 5 stars
