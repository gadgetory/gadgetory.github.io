Authority what's going on everybody and
Here I am with the new Nexus 5x in
comparison with the original the Nexus 5
now the Nexus 5 is a couple of years old
now but its design was one that we do
pretty wistfully think back on
especially with its soft plastic on the
back and the effect that is very
accessible for the hand at 4.95 inches
in the display but the design language
is being continued in the 5x we still
have the plastic design here that has a
bit of a separation in the panel's here
that vary a little bit of a lip on the
back is something that would turns from
the original Nexus 5 but really what we
love the most about it so far is that it
is very easy to handle 5.2 inches in the
screen is what you get for the 5x which
makes it just a little bit larger than
the original Nexus 5 but that is quite
alright when you compare it to the Nexus
6 and the Nexus 6p respectively it's a
very accessible handling experience here
and that's something that we're always
going to give some credit to when it
comes to these sizes of phone of course
on the specification side we have full
HD display as LCDs here and again this
is just under five inches and you have
5.2 on the nexus 5x and underneath the
surface the Snapdragon 800 is what
powers the original Nexus 5 while the
808 is what you get in the 5 X 2
gigabytes of ram is what you get across
the board which is a little odd when you
consider how android has been evolving
since the original Nexus 5 but hopefully
it will be able to power the marshmallow
version of Android here version number
six in the Nexus 5x then just the way
that you really needed to underneath the
surface however we do have a
twenty-seven hundred million power
battery as well on the 5x which should
give it's a pretty good battery life and
I'm just sort of running through a
couple of the applications and just some
of the elements here in the two
different Android iterations we are
going to go into the settings here and I
will show you that of course we are
looking at a difference in the versions
of Android there you go we have lollipop
and marshmallow
and what we have also are just some nice
additions in the 5x including now on tap
what you're seeing a quick demo of right
here that will be able to contextually
find on the screen various search items
that will then be searched automatically
in Google giving you very easy access to
more information you can already see on
the back here also that we have the
fingerprint reader now for now and Nexus
imprint is what it's going to be called
and being able to put the fingerprint on
these particular phones and awake and
unlock the phone in under a second has
really great just by putting your index
finger on there as far as the cameras on
the back here a megapixels is being
bumped up to 12.3 with laser autofocus
over here and it will also bring 4k UHD
video audio of video recording rather
and the applications have been updated
as well you should be able to see some
of these changes if you update the
Google camera in whichever version you
have but hdr+ is being given a nice and
boost along with a couple of extra
features which are not showing up
exactly right here but will be available
when these phones are released now the
lower price of the nexus 5 was what
really made it a beautiful device to buy
especially unlocked and what the nexus
5x we're gonna be starting at $379 for
the 16 gigabyte model here and it is
available on the Google store but
there's also a protection plan that is
being introduced today which is very
nice to have especially for two years
worth of accidental damage coverage so
that was just a quick look at these two
particular devices the Nexus 5x and the
original Nexus 5 stay tuned to Android

devices include comparisons and for
