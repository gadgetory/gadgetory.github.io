Joe Hindy the android authority app guy
and welcome back to Android apps weekly
this is episode number 129 so let's get
to it google has a new feature in their
Gmail application called gmail of Phi
this gives your non-google email
accounts gmail features such as spam
filtering and a whole lot more all you
have to do is sign in to your non gmail
accounts in the gmail app and then
enable the feature to get started and of
course you can unlink them at any time
right on schedule Nintendo has opened up
the pre-registration for their upcoming
me tomo game on mobile devices you'll
have to create a Nintendo account to do
so which doesn't take all that long this
is one step closer to release but we
still don't have an exact date just yet
an app any report was released this week
that predicts that the google play store
sales and revenue should triple by 2020
which is outpacing the Apple App Store
that's good news for Google fans and
especially for google along with all of
the Google Play developers this is most
likely thanks to emerging markets buying
smartphones for the first time the
latest humble bundle is now live this
week will feature a bunch of chemco
games which are all JRPG titles they
provide many hours of gameplay and
decent storylines you can pay one dollar
for all three games beat the average for
three more games or pay six dollars and
get every game it was announced this
week that Google Play games will be
supporting custom gamer tags in the near
future this is a great addition for
those who may not want to game with the
real names and gives gamers the chance
to be a little bit creative it's rolling
out right now and should reach you soon
for even more Android apps and games
news releases and updates don't forget
to check out this week's newsletter
which is linked in the video description
below there will have a ton of stuff
that we didn't have time for here if you
would like you can sign up for the
newsletter using the form that's in the
written companion which is also linked
in the video description below and get
it sent to your inbox every Sunday okay
folks let's take a look at the apps and
games that made anything splash this
week as usual if you want to check any
of these apps or games out you can find
those links in the video description
below splash cars is a fun little free
roaming game where you drive a car
around that drops paint so you can
literally paint the town than
annex are relatively simple and the
premise is easy to understand you drive
around painting stuff to add color all
while being tailed by the police there
are power-ups that can hinder the police
and you can even turn folks to your
cause it's a time waster to be sure but
it's a good little diversion that's
worth checking out foodie is a free
camera application that was released by
line the well-known chatting and call
service it's an easy camera application
that has 26 built-in filters that are
specifically made to bring some pizzazz
to your food photography on top of the
filters there are also some lightweight
editing tools to further enhance the
images auto blurring and a guide is
included to help you make the best of it
it's entirely free with no in-app
purchases and that means there's no harm
in trying it out gamebattles is an
eSports gaming platform that lets
players compete against one another form
teams prepare matches in all kinds of
other stuff the application is an
extension of the service and it lets you
check up on upcoming matches view your
profile and see any achievements you may
have earned it's a little simple but it
looks nice and seems to work smoothly if
you do any competitive gaming it may be
worth looking into this one wolfram has
released a beta application for Wolfram
cloud which is an app that taps into
their popular web service using this
application you can access the Wolfram
programming cloud and continue working
on projects you may have there of course
those people who are interested in the
application like this already use the
service or are intending on using it
still the application seems to work
pretty well and it's a great addition if
you use wolfram cloud already the
bombing bastards touches an unapologetic
Bomberman clone that uses a lot of the
same concepts and ideas the game
features 30 puzzle maps across five
worlds for you to play through each one
will be riddled with puzzles bad guys
and power-ups to help you along the way
and there are even boss fights what
makes this game unique is that it's
entirely free with no in-app purchases
and it's probably the best game at this
price point that we've seen in a very
long time go ahead and check it out once
