Clayton over at Android Authority calm
and today i'm bringing you the review of
the galaxy tab 10.1 to model now i have
had this device for about a week so I've
had a good amount of time to realize
everything I like and dislike about it
I'm just going to show you some of the
stuff that i found out anyways uh as you
may know this device is running for dot
0 dot 3 ice cream sandwich and we can go
to the settings and check that out we'll
go down here to be about device if
you're running for dot 3 and basically
this is a TouchWiz overlay over the ice
cream sandwich it still has a lot of
cool like fonts and whatnot I mean all
these are revamped its TouchWiz it's
similar in reminiscent to the honeycomb
operating system but it does have the
Ice Cream Sandwich flavor to it so
basically we're going here you can see
you then on our TouchWiz we have our
TouchWiz menu where we can bring up the
all these little touch with icons and
stuff we have our alarm calculator email
music player s planner task manager and
world clock but the cool thing about
these is that when you select one bring
up the music player it actually brings a
floating window up and we can actually
continue to work do whatever we're doing
on our galaxy tab with this window I'm
kind of just levitating there and so we
can be playing songs and whatnot and
still do work still surf the web check
our email whatnot and we can also expand
these to their full application so now
we're in the full music player anyways
we can do that with any one of these
things the task manager is really like
nifty to do because then you can kill
your processes as you're working just go
ahead and click end all Ram manager of
course this is reminiscent of the
honeycomb another cool thing is that
when you take a screenshot with this
device immediately it brings you into
the photo editing application so almost
like the functionality I'm a guess that
will see on the note 10.1 with minus the
S Pen we have the ability to kind of
just like edit our videos we circle that
and underline stuff you know we can edit
our photos
and you know we can just do a lot of
cool stuff we have the lasso object like
we can we can select the objects here
and cut them out everything like that we
can move it around and then we can save
another thing i found out that is cool
is that um this device has insane
battery life I give you a good idea I'll
go to the gallery and show you actually
a screenshot i took of this device just
about yesterday you can see here this is
this a screenshot but it was this device
in fact and i had eleven percent and it
had been three days three hours 51
minutes on the battery with sixty-nine
percent of the time having the screen on
so for three days and three hours
without having to charge this device we
still had eleven percent and I mean I
had my email pushing every 15 minutes I
had my Wi-Fi connected at least half the
time you know I'm using a lot of media
and a lot of data we still had a really
good battery life now that's definitely
battery life that exceeds that of the
galaxy tab 10.1 original model so I'm
very impressed with that one thing I
dislike about the model of the two
second model is that it's kind of
obtrusive to hold like you can't really
pick this thing up unless you grab the
screener unless you have two hands but
if you're laying on your bed and
watching a video you know or you're
listening to something it's kind of
obtrusive to pick this thing up because
you basically have to grab the screen if
you're lifting it with one hand then
that causes you to you know touch things
on the screen or select icons it's not
really a good area to just grab this
thing and might be able to hold it with
one hand without you know having to use
some strength or it's going to slip out
of your hand and whatnot another thing
that I've ran into is that this device
is very fast despite having just a 1
gigahertz processor the dual core it
still runs everything with great speed
you know it's really buttery smooth
there's no lag anything like that it
just runs it perfectly and for those of
you that are wanting to root your galaxy
tab 2 there is already methods out to do
that as you see here I've got the
superuser installed and the device is
fully rooted we can go to the root
checker application and I can in fact
prove that this device is rooted we've
got a video on that here and android
authority com I'll just verify root
access and we have the device as
root access congratulations so that's
great I like that you already have root
methods for this device will probably be
seeing custom roms and whatnot come out
soon now another thing I dislike about
the galaxy tab 10.1 to is the stock
music player I think they did a better
job with the galaxy tab 10.1 original
but hey I mean it's Android you can get
other music players off the market and
whatnot but if you're going to use this
you know I would just be a little wary
it's got some bugs but I'm sure there's
going to be software updates here just
in a little bit you know fix the bugs
and whatnot but let's say we're
listening to music and we have it on
shuffle a lot of times it just brings us
to like the same song over and over
again and you can't really like escape
the good shuffle I mean it works all
right go back it has like a nice user
interface and whatnot but i would
suggest using like google play music or
something else besides the stock music
player see this comes with the play
music so I mean we've got everything
that works here and I have a lot of
music on this I've been testing it out
the speakers work great everything
sounds nice and overall this is a really
nice tablet you know aside from a few of
the cons I pointed out this is a really
nice tablet I enjoy my galaxy tab 10.1
original just as much I think they made
you know a few improvements on this you
know of course the operating system and
the different design the user interface
and TouchWiz but I'm going to have to go
ahead and say that whenever there's a
custom rom out for this I would
definitely get rid of the TouchWiz it's
just old it doesn't really have that
many improvements over the original
honeycomb that came on these tablets but
there are some cool stuff that ice cream
sandwich has such as the data usage
monitoring where you can monitor all the
data you've used and what not and you
know there's a power saving feature
which I actually had not undid not have
the power saving feature on at all for
the three days of this battery lasted
which is really cool and of course our
developer options where we can choose to
you know use hardware acceleration stuff
like that and you know our show touches
screen updates and point location so
anyways guys that was a quick review of
the galaxy tab 10.1 to a week after
having this in my possession and if you
guys like the videos subscribe to
