it's probably the most feature packed
phone that I've ever reviewed okay so
like I talked about my hands on there's
probably about four things that make
this phone stand out from all the rest
of the Android phones out right now so
let's focus on those you pretty much
can't talk about the mate 20 Pro without
talking about the cameras because
there's three cameras in the back of
this phone you've got a super wide angle
camera a 40 megapixel camera kind of
like we saw in the p20 Pro and you've
got a 3x telephoto camera with optical
image stabilization now the place to end
this cube like structure that is
definitely gonna be really polarizing
but after using it for the past week or
so I've actually come to really like the
design
now the wide-angle camera in this phone
is great it doubles as a super macro
lens so you can pretty much just get
super close to your object and it's
surprisingly sharp for better or worse
but it's really nice having the option
in this phone because that's something
you don't really see and that many other
phones right now and like I said before
the main sensor on this phone is 40
megapixels which means you can get some
pretty insane resolution out of this
thing now I was really surprised by the
color accuracy and I was really happy
with how it reproduced the color but it
did tend to overexpose images quite a
bit now if you drop the exposure down
just a little bit you can get some
really really nice imagery out of this
thing and here's a few examples just to
show you what this thing can do the low
light mode on this thing is okay it's
not quite as good as something like the
Google pixel 3 but I think that Huawei
is expecting you to use the night mode
which kind of uses AI to stabilize a
long exposure and that works really
really well the third camera is a 3x
telephoto lens with optical image
stabilization and obviously like a
telephoto lens is gonna be a lot better
than something like a software crop you
can do this thing where it's a 5x zoom
with the telephoto in a little bit of a
software crop and that ended up looking
really good if you move around to the
front you're getting a selfie camera
that's 24 megapixels and that's a lot of
megapixels for a selfie camera
for some reason though the images just
seemed really soft and I turned off all
the beauty modes and skin smoothing
modes but they just ended up still being
soft
oh also you're probably gonna need to
drop the exposure on the selfie camera
as well because it also tends to
overexpose overall this thing is just a
total beast of a camera system
well smartphone but it's pretty much
just a camera system with a really good
smartphone attached to it okay so now we
move past the main thing that people are
probably gonna want to know about we get
to the in screen fingerprint reader now
I've tested a lot of these fingerprint
readers in the past and they've been
pretty bad so I'm surprised when the
huawei mate 20 pros was actually pretty
good now obviously it's not quite as
fast as something like face unlock or a
regular fingerprint reader but it's
pretty quick for what it is and I only
really had a few issues when I touched
it with like the side of my finger but
if you just reposition your finger it
gets it pretty quickly
what's nice as you can also use this in
screen fingerprint reader for things
like bake payments or password
management and I could see a lot of
other manufacturers eventually adopting
this as the standard especially since
this one is so good already the third
major feature and probably the coolest
feature in this phone in my opinion is
what while he's calling reverse wireless
charging which is exactly what it sounds
like it is you can pretty much just set
any other phone on this phone it'll use
the phone's battery to charge that other
phone up and it doesn't have to be a
phone either you can use pretty much
anything that has Qi charging in it the
bad news is that it's really slow and
pretty inconsistent so if you leave
another phone on this phone for like a
few minutes you might get 1% or so but
it's definitely not nearly nearly as
fast it's just wireless charging
something on a regular qi pad it's also
kind of inconsistent so you can set a
phone on the device and it'll say it's
charging for like half a second and then
it'll drop off and suddenly not be
charging anymore I'm really hoping that
while we is gonna fix this in a software
update because they told me this
software is not final but they are
shipping this phone right now and if
they're shipping it to customers already
I don't really buy that whole software
it's not final thing either way this is
the kind of innovation that I like to
see just like that in screen fingerprint
reader being two generations
and being a lot better than the first
generation I really hope that Wally
improves on this reverse wireless
charging concept and it just becomes a
baseline in their phones number four and
the last major thing that we talked
about in our hands-on with this phone
was the Kirin 980 processor while we
says that this processor should
significantly increase battery life
because of this new big dot little dot
little architecture and I definitely
found that to be the case I got like six
and a half to seven and a half hours of
screen on time out of this phone and I
haven't seen the screen on time as good
as that since I reviewed the galaxy note
9 now performance out of this chip is
pretty good in general obviously you
can't really see a huge differentiation
between phone ships nowadays I did see a
little bit of stuttering when launching
and multitasking apps here and there but
it happened really infrequently and
you're probably not gonna notice it in
everyday use alright so now that we're
past those big four things we can start
talking about the little things in this
phone I like the design of this phone a
lot it really reminds me of like a
galaxy s 9 that's really updated with
Huawei's design language but that
doesn't make it really slippery because
it's curved on all four sides now you
can get a case with this phone it
actually comes with a clear one that
makes it a little grippy er but clear
cases generally degrade over time and
end up looking just kind of crappy so I
do they get a different case or just
take the risk and use it as is I did
drop it multiple multiple times and I'd
still don't really see any cracks or
scratches on it so that's a plus but do
that at your own risk
the speakers on this phone sound pretty
good and they actually primarily come
out of the USBC port which is pretty
weird you might think that maybe if
you're charging your phone it's gonna be
extremely muffled and while it was a
little bit muffled while charging it's
not really that noticeable and there
actually is another speaker in the
earpiece so you're still gonna be able
to play music or watch YouTube videos or
whatever you do with your sound while we
emui 9.0 is based on Android Pi and it's
actually pretty good it's a lot more
toned down than it was in the previous
version and well it doesn't ship with
things like the app drawer those are
things that you can turn on in the
settings all right now I kind of hate
discussing specs because a lot of phones
pretty much run the same at this point
but I'm gonna throw them up on the
screen for you guys that want to see
them
the huawei mate pitoni Pro is available
right now and it starts at 1050 euros
which is about $1,250 us and that's a
ton of money for a smartphone but
there's also one of the most
feature-rich smartphones we've ever seen
so that's kind of the trade-off that you
have to make here now while I generally
have a pretty hard stance on the phone
especially considering a price I'm
probably gonna have to leave this one up
to you guys because even though it's one
of the most expensive Android flagships
we've seen in a long time it's also one
of the most feature-rich all I can say
is that I do really love this phone I've
gotten photos off of it that I probably
couldn't get with pretty much any other
Android smartphone right now and I just
love seeing while we push the boundaries
with all these innovations that they
stack into this thing
so please do let me know in the comment
section if you would actually consider
buying this thing at twelve-hundred 50
US dollars it's a lot more expensive
than a lot of other smart phones and
there are ones that are almost as good
for like half the price but you're just
getting all these special innovations
that only Huawei has really been able to
show off and I think that's awesome if
you do want to read a lot more about
this phone or look at all the little
specifics of it we do have a full
written review up on the website
we've also uploaded a lot of the photos
in full resolution so you can pixel beep
if you want to I'm gonna go move on to
the next phone but until then I will see
you in the next video
