by Toyota hey strasburg are from Andhra
30 what's going on everybody and here we
are taking a look at the Alcatel
OneTouch hero we already looked at the
idol x 25 inch offering from them but
now as you can see here is a six inch
offering that brings 1080p resolution
into an IPS display as you can see up
front it looks real nice very good
collar is very good vibrancy the six
inch phone will bring you some pretty
nice performance with a MediaTek
processor a quad-core MediaTek processor
that clocks in at 1.5 gigahertz and
underneath that we have a 3400 milliamp
hour battery that will be able to
sustain the performance that you're
looking for from here as far as the
actual OS go as we see that it is very
nice OS and if I were to bring down the
notification drop-down just right here
when I go to the notification shade and
look at the power widgets it don't show
just a little bit of you know it's just
a little bit of a lack of speed there
that really doesn't matter too much but
it was just something that I did notice
however everywhere else in the actual
operating system everything just looking
real nice very nice and snappy so it's
still fine there one thing that I really
like about this phone is at the bottom
if you can see there the capacity of
keys are very nice and low down there on
the front and that allows for a very
nice and large 6 inch screen and allows
the real estate to just sort of stay
very large and without too much extra on
top or bottom as far as the build
quality goes we do have the power
buttons right over here where your thumb
would basically land you might have a
little bit of trouble getting to it and
a nice soft touch plastic on the back
now one of my favorite parts about this
gun is definitely the six pin connectors
right here that are actually used for a
number of different accessories and one
of them in particular is the lips one of
them in particular is a smart cover that
uses leds in order to show you at a
glance just a couple of notifications
there we can actually take a look at it
in a little bit
alright so he was the phone and the
Smart Cover right over here now as I
said before the six pin connector is
right there on the side and you always
get that very very satisfying inaudible
click right over there and once it comes
on it begins to display all of your
information there that you need this is
just a demonstration so it's not going
to go this quickly however it does show
you real quick that may be of a call or
an alarms going off or the time and it
doesn't have to show everything at once
but it does protect the phone it's
latches on in a very easy way and then
of course it is a nice smart cover that
gives to the front so that is the
Alcatel OneTouch hero as you can see
there it's a very nice six-inch phone
that will come in at around the three
hundred fifty dollar price point however
it is mostly just available in Asia they
are working on a partnership to get
these phones out to America into the
western states so it'd be very nice to
see this phone come out in the Western
market once again this is Joshua guard
from android authority and we're taking
a look at the alcatel offerings here at
CES 2014 and once again thank you to
Toyota for sponsoring our CES coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
