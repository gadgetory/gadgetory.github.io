original android hangout show on google+
I'm dare cross I'm Scott Anderson I'm
Dan Charlton I'm Johnathan Franklin and
this week we're going to talk about the
samsung galaxy s4 just launched it or
was announced a little bit ago and we're
going to talk about some Android
ecosystem news some shakeups in the
Android ecosystem and then we'll talk
about some comparisons on the galaxy s4
vs the galaxy s3 the note to the HTC One
and the Old Faithful the nexus 4 so
let's get started Scott let's hit up
some Android ecosystem news before we a
sgs4 all the things okay so Andy Rubin
you know the leader of Android Godfather
right yeah you can call me yeah that's a
better name he is moving on and he's
moving to a new chapter at Google uh
basically he states that he's an
entrepreneur at heart and he's possibly
moving to Google X some new things
developing some new things yeah and the
new leader is going to be sundar I don't
know his last name tied to enjoy each
other he knows sundar Pichai he's Indian
so so he was the overseer of chrome and
Chrome apps and now he's going to be
leading Android as well which is pretty
exciting and I'm very interested to see
where he takes both platforms you guys
think is going to happen here is this a
good move by google or well i think that
if andy rubin is moving on to the next
chapter and that next chapter is in fact
the google x project which we know a
little about besides glass and draught
self-driving cars i think that that
that's awesome and that says a lot
because if you look at what andy rubin
has done he started out as an
entrepreneur which he said it himself
with with android he fostered android
from nothing
into this awesome global dominating
force he is though he he's a force to be
reckoned with when it comes to launching
a product a successful product and
Google is putting him on something that
we don't know what it is but they want
it to be as successful and have a major
impact on up a major impact on society
so I think that this is a good move you
know and besides you know Google act is
rumored to be all about you know
wearable computing and making life
easier well beat somebody that was
completely successful in mobile
technology seems like the perfect guy
for that solution Alex I'm excited to
see what comes out of Google X as a
Google fan and then as an Android
enthusiast I'm I'm curious as to what
the future holds for Android especially
know people for a while now but talking
about mergers of Android and chrome and
you know or they are they merging are
they getting married and playing nicely
you know no one really knows what's
going to happen but then we have this
this elephant in the room you know we
have we have this Chromebook pixel where
Chrome OS really isn't optimized for
touch and it it's tagline is for what's
next we don't know what next is but what
we do know is we know that there's a
Chrome Android statue coming out of a
window we could we could read into
things here and say where's that chrome
statue coming out of a window AKA a tab
enough so we're going to launch Chrome
apps in a tab that's that's wrong we're
gonna be able to launch it will launch
android apps in a chrome tab I don't
know I think that will be cool and then
boost the market for larger sized
android apps yeah yes so my advice to
developers is if you have a android app
that is not looking gorgeous on the
Nexus 10 right now you might want to
step it up a little bit just just in
case I'm not crazy
pixel gets android app support and you
know what if i am crazy that doesn't
happen the worst thing that can happen
is is that you have a gorgeous app on
the next step that's really a win-win
scenario yeah exactly you've been crazy
before so I don't know so in sedan
Johnny you think you know this is a good
move for for Android as a whole you know
you know what sundar gonna do he's
managing chrome and now Android I mean
two major facing products for for google
it's a really good move I think because
um well Andy Rubin is already he was
with day danger before he was with
Android he's always gone from the
moonshot kind of development side he's
probably burned out a little bit he's
probably a little bit bored with it
because androids pretty well established
at this point but it makes sense um you
know Android to me he's bigger the
bigger thing that Android needs to
accomplish now is the google side of
android more than the actual framework
of android and sundar has been over
chrome but he's also been over a gmail
web apps calendar and the google drive
and he's really it's gonna be
interesting to see chrome and Android
under one roof and kind of have one
general direction as to how they're
taking the usability of both operating
systems and taking it into account for
kind of a unified user experience to
anybody that uses either one of them so
i think you can really bring something
new to the table because android always
kind of been that division of google
that's a little bit different yeah
that's true yeah i agree i mean i
definitely think it's good for the
android community I mean Andy Rubin is
you know sort of the inventor of more or
less Android and yeah behind it all day
really it's a lot of other people that
are doing the meat and bones of what is
android on a day to day basis we're just
talking about the person managing it
right like the thieves doortay is still
handling UI design and you know all the
other big name people are in all the
other big-name positions throughout it
it's just the director of the division
is changing i think that soon dollars
got the experience of managing a certain
incorporate ongoing established division
like Rome that will be good for Android
to have that kind of credibility to it
um and I definitely think it'll be
interesting to see what any woman does
because he's definitely a good
entrepreneur all right so what else we
got on the Android ecosystem front well
ad blocking apps you guys are familiar
with those you know install an app build
your hosts file rebuild it add some
hosts files they're basically ad
blocking apps have been pulled from the
Play Store basically this in a nutshell
they were violating the terms of service
according to google and this in turn
hurt developers because if you could get
a ad blocker then you would no longer
see ads you also it would hurt Google
because you know what Google's revenue
is developers revenue is and it kind of
hurts everybody on the platform so
basically this will make developers a
little bit more happy and will honestly
be able to give you know developers
money for their actual work and that's
right how do you guys feel about this
you know our that's our choice or I
think it's it's it's good because
developers do need to get paid for their
work a developer that puts out a free
app and then puts ads in there you know
to make money that that's how they get
paid for their work it's a free app now
a lot of developers will have an app
that you might cost two bucks three
bucks or whatever with no ads that's
fine too so it only costs a couple
dollars we really need to learn to to
not be cheap and to just give the
developer money for their hard-earned
work now what what's interesting about
this my take is is that people AdBlocker
only worked for rooted users so I really
don't think this is going to change a
lot of things because if you're already
a rooted user you're okay with doing
things a little outside the norm so
you're just going to install the app
from you're going to sideload the app
you're going to install it from a third
party location you're not going to
download it from the Play Store that's
fine you're just going to go and to XDA
developers or roots wiki or wherever the
app is posted and you're going to
download it and install it there so I'm
not saying to go ahead and do that I'm
just saying that while this might be a
step in the right direction to make
money for developers and for google I
just don't think it's really going to do
a whole lot I just gonna make it harder
yeah I agree and I mean it it's not that
compressive to habitats I mean it's one
thing for the applications that are
spamming you with ads but those are
getting fewer and further between as
long as you are downloading every hello
kitty app that you can buy all those
right like don't just start downloading
every random grabby apps or let your
kids do it like my son his Layton his
tablet / my old tablet with every single
talking animal app there is and when you
when you hit the notification window
there's like 50 50 action shot not their
closet yes I you gotta be yet to be
careful another thing with mentions a
lot of developers internationally don't
have an option to actually make a play
the paid app so ads are there only form
of revenue yep it's a good point I
actually did not know that ya know only
places only certain places places that
do not allow you to sell apps you can't
be a developer it makes money through
google play there you're very like they
are to lodge do transactions there
that's the problem okay all right
then another big one uh is google
announced that Google Reader is doing a
little bit more cleaning and is taking
away Google Reader until I first which I
use daily I don't know about you guys
are you guys constant users Dan not so
much John yes you are Derek you i'm i am
a on the on a laptop or desktop i have
read or open right now i have read her
open every day that i'm on a laptop
desktop all day long um on my tablet and
all my phone i use currents because it
looks nice and I've been able to you
know manage I kind of forced myself to
using it at first I really didn't like
it at first but uh I kind of forced
myself to it and now I like it now I I
use it all the time but I like to read
her because it was easy to share content
and I'm a guy that pushes out a lot of
content and shares a lot of crap oh I
miss reader but I'm curious what comes
next because Google king can't kill a
service that is that popular without
giving us an alternative so this gets
back into what we were talking about
earlier i think currents in one way
shape or another is going to come to
chrome if that's going to be a web app
or if that's going to be a android app
iiii think that Google will have an
answer for us before reader expires
fingers crossed confidence hi it's
called google notably a pastor google
i/o mm-hmm oh yeah good point and it is
so game-changing stuff happens at i/o
everybody's calm down everybody realizes
the world isn't ending because something
cool and awesome is happening and then
they're like I know it sucks it readers
not here but look at these new bells and
whistles on this app coucher exactly
today okay okay I'm during all weird
like 130 app updates during you know the
keynote yes oh no miss so this is
oh and while we're doing that spam with
updates yeah so so let's talk about the
thing that everybody wants to know about
about three hours ago samsung took over
New York City specifically Times Square
pacifically Radio City and let the world
know what the next galaxy is and Dan
being our resident a hardware guy and
most critical android authority member
that I know or person or person um do
you think it's as awesome as the hype
portrayed it to be alright so tell us
all about the hardware well I think it's
not unimpressive they have a four point
nine nine inch 1080p what do they call
it some new type of an oled screen
that's sort of super amoled but special
um using phosphorous on something
phosphoryl have a letter yeah a family
yeah yeah some new Samsung basically
they finally got to have a Ledge work on
tiny and they call it some new day
because they call it some new name every
year so why not do it again uh what else
that is at 441 PPI so that is pretty
pixel that's not quite as much as the
smaller HTC One but still very very
dense and a lot denser than anything 441
pixels is nothing to be upset about no
no those well beyond what you can
distinguish with your eyes well beyond
say it's like retina times two oh my god
stop doing their words retina according
to Apple for a phone is roughly 300 to
350 PPI so well beyond retina quality um
the processor is going to depend on
where you live if you live in a non LTE
market than you
get samsung's xedos 4 or 5 octa the
much-talked-about dual quad-core
processor with four cortex a15 two views
at one point six fingers and then four
more cortex a7 at only one point two
gigahertz for you know the lower sort of
less intensive tasks so it's a highly
exciting to see the benchmarks on that
the more impressive piece though is the
least of my opinion is the GPU that's
paired with it they're using the power
VR sgx544 mp3 GPU so this is the exact
same TPU that's in the ipad 4 with one
exception one on the ipad 4 has four
cores this one's only three so it's not
going to be as powerful but it's also
clocked way up to 533 megahertz so it
should be a very very capable device in
the graphics department for LTE markets
notably the u.s. rumored also for the UK
you're getting a Qualcomm Snapdragon 600
that's the same CPU that's an HTC One
and the LG optimus pro although this one
is clocked to have 1.9 here so it's a
little faster now what what graphics GPU
is is with that so that's still the same
in Adreno 320 that's any other ones with
the same chipset but it's also the same
one that's in with the the s4 pro so the
same that's with the nexus for the droid
DNA I mean it's definitely capable GPU
but it's not as capable as the power vr
that's so if you live in the US should
we feel gypped that we're not getting as
a powerful GPU to be no I wouldn't
because I mean Qualcomm is also showing
off that GPU running for simultaneous
videos one on each processing core I
mean it can handle pushing multiple HD
videos at the same time it's definitely
capable it's not as fast and as capable
and as powerful as the Barbie honor but
it's I mean it's certainly adequate
okay all right now that that makes me
feel a little bit better living on this
side of the pond I guess yeah yeah I
mean and it's it's the same as really
all the other top of the line phones
that you're getting in America right now
because yeah everything else is shipping
with this after 18 600 and this but this
is gonna be a 1.9 gigahertz so it is
gonna be a little bit faster so yeah you
get a little bit little bit of a bump
there in either version you're getting 2
gigabytes of RAM and it's gonna come
with 16 32 or 64 gigabytes of internal
storage so that's that's nuts right
there so you could have a 64 gig
internal storage and you can get a 64
gig SD card because the s4 supports that
so you can have a server in your pocket
if you want that's cool I mean so if you
need massive amounts of locally stored
video on your cell phone on your on your
cell phone then you can do that with the
s4 definitely definitely on the current
apartment Sampson clearly does not agree
with HTC and does think that pixels are
everything so we have a 13-megapixel
rear shooter in a 2 megapixel front
shooter we've got a 9.88 one hour
battery which is 2600 milliamp hours now
back to the camera dan I think that that
it's noteworthy to mention that not a
whole lot of phones have a 2-megapixel
front-facing camera that's true it's def
already right notice when we're just vga
camera 3 I want to close to read yeah
most are either vga which i think is
point 6 or their 1.3 megapixels so this
is definitely a high-quality
front-facing camera as well although i
think that the s3 might have had a
2-megapixel front-facing i know that the
HTC Amaze did I think the DNA has like a
2 plus that thing that shows off a wider
angle to yeah yeah and it's definitely
not you know record-breaking or anything
but it's idiot nest we had a 1.9 so they
gave it a point more so well they just
made a marketing they just proud that
musically rounded well you know what
they did round up for the
the screen during the presentation they
said oh I had a 5-inch screen it's 4.99
why Bernie Sanders we knew you're making
me know you're lying you're trying to
fit bus you know don't do that yeah yeah
in the connectivity department we've got
all the usual suspects Wi-Fi a/b/g/n
Wi-Fi to rags to a band Wi-Fi um gps
bluetooth kelowna so it doesn't have
bluetooth five like those leaks said huh
no it does not it does not have the
non-existent bluetooth standard that's
good well that's good now it's good to
know yeah once we saw that leak that had
55 point 0 bluetooth right now that
doesn't even exist it's coming in the in
the cellular connectivity department
it's gonna differ based on whether or
not you've got caught in your pocket if
you do then you can get LTE on as many
as six bands at once plus hspa+ up to 42
actually possibly or um but there aren't
any networks that have that so it
doesn't think their hspa+ gsm cdma so it
mean it's going to be everything they
made a big deal to say there's no reason
for the warm with people's international
version other than that they want to
release something with their very own
processor in it because the US version
could run all the hair anywhere around
the world and then during the
presentation they made a big deal saying
that you know the s4 was able to do 100
megabit down and 50 megabit up with over
LTE naughty nurses cut kinda thing that
that's called the definition of LTE yeah
but III think they were doing that to
say look if something awesome comes out
in a year from now you know what I mean
that look what we can do yeah there's
nothing awesome that's coming out is
actually coming out in month or less
it's called lte-advanced exactly and
that doesn't help because it doesn't
support LTE Advanced and sports category
3 LTE the theoretical max down of 100
megabits and off of 50 and that's the
exact same as every other LTE device
that's ever been on the market
and that is why we can play LTE and
that's why they're gonna sell the next
iteration because it's gonna be
something that will be you know
desirable right so so what causes this
coming just your regular black and white
or something fancy smancy black mist and
white frost what both militarily samsung
is taking after the car companies in
coloring next we're gonna get plumb
crazy candy apple red yeah i would i
would buy a well you know what man candy
apple red but I'd by a laser red you
know I go for the supplier green model
one sec sublime an alright so GD Muslim
what's that do you mention the IR
blaster no not mentioning IR blaster
yeah that's a notable feature it will
have an IR blaster so you can actually
use it as a TV remote although the HTC
one also has that feature um which is
cool like audio system that's just built
into this is Radio sinless 600 so MHL so
so actually I have a question about that
you said it's built into the radio
that's in the Snapdragon 600 not
actually the radio it's the radio front
end which I never moves into the
baseband that's paired with well no it
isn't all right all right all right what
I see so so let's talk about software
because Samsung taught us a year ago
that the age of the spec had passed and
then basically the last 20 minutes the
show doesn't matter oh just here to
waste my time Samsung taught us that
software is king and we need to sell
features and sell you know we sell
products by selling features because
people don't care about specs which the
general population does and they don't
know numbers are then they just want it
to work and how is it going to work with
things such as smart pause everything
has to have it has some beginning we
exactly every except for floating touch
maybe go an S touch i will call it s
touch all right so look so smart pause
is looking at a video and then you look
away from it and it is smart enough to
know wait a second they're not watching
this anymore we're gonna pause it and
then when they look back we're gonna
we're going to resume okay so
immediately when I saw this feature then
I heard about this feature being
released I was like hey I'm watching a
music video or like some audio on
YouTube and if it's smart enough to you
know look no way I'm looking away and
I'm doing your head banging you're
screwed yeah no yeah it's off on off on
so you said it's like off yay if it's
like oh stop like you won't you can't
advance this phone it would become
tricky actually know what that's what i
want to see LG somebody make a youtube
video trying to dance in the video keep
pausing well maybe that's a group place
for you know somebody else's plenary
alright so we'll get to that I so
floating touch um that's where which out
sounds you hover your finger over the
screen and it kind of almost acts like
the note 2 S Pen features but with your
finger yeah that's awesome I got school
I'd like to try it out yeah I i would
i'd like to sit there and wheeze and
Sony done that already though yeah i'm
not aware i don't know so if you're
watching right now and you're like
floating touch so he's done that before
let us know his comments yeah let us
know in the comments i'm not sure now
next feature I'll i was watching the the
presentation i started laughing when i
saw it because I'm like ha every android
user can already do this but but you
know what Samsung has to brand
everything so they branded the s
translator which the s translator is
their own version of Google Translate
where it does live translation with it
when you're talking into it it literally
does the exact same thing yes so 2s
translate this would be unremovable
bloatware that doesn't do anything you
couldn't already do yeah so I understand
this is you know we'll get to this the
end here but there's a trend here you're
gonna start to see so s voice came out
with the s3 they continue to do it again
this time yes voice you know is
supposedly getting bigger
better stronger batter more bloating
like siri always more bloated you can
the jellybean s voice oh yeah the
jellybean voice actions voice search is
awesome I don't see the need for
Samsung's own s voice except for the
ability to read text messages to you
that's a nice feature I'm not you know
that's nice but you really don't need s
voice when you can do almost everything
with the built-in ah you guys see a
value for s voice no it's just
unremovable gloat I can almost see it in
a market that don't doesn't have google
services ah there you go okay alright so
Joe Hindy wins the prize um what if you
win we'll talk after the show I I don't
know thank you so so joe said that the
ex Xperia Sola devices had floating
touch sedan was right Dan's right a lot
you know we should dan is almost always
right I'd so so the next thing is s
travel which is kind of like car mode
and google maps and navigation google
navigation so you know once again it's
yeah you know these features kind of
already exist yes int as as a google
service so you noticing a trend yet all
right so maybe the next we'll help you
hit home so s hub which a bunch of
samsung device has already had ass hub
but but they made a key point in saying
look you can go here to buy your movie
or go here and buy your content your
music your magazines in your books hey
look this awesome magazine reader we
have so they're dis aligning themselves
away from google play apps such as play
movies playing music play books and play
movie or play magazines which they
demoed during the presentation so
they're you know not aligning themselves
with google services like still now we
started to see a trend here right um
another google service at home saying
the homes inc is cool homesync is when
you take a picture on your phone and you
have the samsung home server sitting in
your house and it syncs to your one
terabyte of local storage at your house
but you can already do this you can
already take a picture with instant
upload it sinks it to Google server so
you don't have to worry about your home
server dying or your internet going out
at home and not being able to access it
so that's another sway there they're
putting the kibosh on the goop the goob
um oh good chat on channel is a cool
service it's exactly like hangouts with
one person although more bloated is so
they're doing something that already
exists again in android is called chat
on but and last but not least service
that's replicated that you really don't
need is their version of google wallet
which is that the first device to launch
with visas new payWave their mobile
payment system which really you could
you can do this with what Google Wallet
so before we get into a few other
services that aren't already existing it
kind of seems like Samsung is really
really really pushing their ecosystem
hard so that you don't you don't need
Google you know you have samsung here
for all these services and all these
apps you don't need Google Play you can
use samsung yeah I don't think just
showing the apps in people's faces is
going to make them use them ah people
that don't know any better this they
sell millions of these devices not
everybody knows better that's very true
the average person's going to see click
here to buy a book you know or whatever
the S hub book apps called and our
magazine and they're gonna use that
seriously why has it come to OEMs
appealing to the stupidest consumer on
that's what they do they're
bottom-feeders that's where you get your
money but I mean in some cases inferior
blow where it hasn't worked though yeah
but this is what I see from sams they
are appealing to the least common
denominator a person who can't figure
out how to tie their shoes in the
morning oh my god how in God's name do I
accomplish anything with this sofa first
of all it's pretty difficult to tires
yours in the morning if you ever tried
it I mean I do have sleep on me daily
cessfully in this I millions of devices
it's tragic I really wonder how much
resources this all these things take up
alright so so let's uh let's talk about
another service that it actually doesn't
exist let's talk about group play oh
wait you wouldn't thumb of this stuff
done but I so so so group play is kind
of neat group play allows you to share
music and docs and games without Wi-Fi
you don't need to be on a common network
to sit there and share music to one
another and play music to one another
during the presentation hey everybody
you know had had their had what four or
five five different galaxy s4 s and the
women we're going to make surround sound
you know a five-point surround sound
system and that's kind of cool i guess
with phones I didn't say how practical
was I said it was cool but I i don't
know i guess it's cool that way you know
if you're I don't know wanting to share
music when there's no Wi-Fi you and your
buddy can sit there and listen to music
on their own individual phone exactly
what protocol are they using I don't
know I were to I would assume
something with Wi-Fi direct but I I
obviously they noticed Wi-Fi that but
basically what they're saying is we
don't make you have a Wi-Fi network
we're just gonna create an ad hoc Wi-Fi
network of our very own you're still
using Wi-Fi yeah don't they do that
using that prevents you from using Wi-Fi
yeah there's one thing they didn't
actually demonstrate they didn't
actually demonstrate s mean then even
talk about SB me cuz she's stupid it's
just NFC and activated Wi-Fi direct
alright so the the camera features are
interesting dual camera actually is
probably one of the neater things that
that you got to hear about tonight so
dual camera is basically what it sounds
like both cameras on the phone are are
active so like right now let's say my
kids are doing something cool and I
gotta take a picture of
and then daddy doesn't get to be in the
picture right well with dual camera I
can take a picture of my kids doing
something cute and I can take a picture
of me basically at the same time with
the front facing camera and for lack of
better words Photoshop myself into the
picture with them that's not all work
that's how it works photoshop is not
used samsung photoshop sit for you guess
shop ok this job is open okay let me let
me explain better since Scott didn't
like my explanation okay so you go to
take a picture with the rear facing
camera or video it takes the video it
takes the the camera shot and then I say
it would look better if I was in the
picture with said scene I can then put
my head shot in there going you know are
so you get to include yourself in the
videos and in the photos you get the
photo balm your own photos you can take
pictures of your friends and then
include yourself because you're taking
the picture in the that's weird yeah a
putative being a photoshop because
you're 2 megapixel picture looks a lot
different now you can be that creepy guy
that like goes to the mall and takes
random pictures of people and then like
you know that then dual dual cameras
yourself into the background with all
these people that is freaking weird oh
so but that's a didn't eat it's a neat
feature one thing I liked was as health
kind of cool yeah built-in pedometer it
has a built in pedometer which is kind
of cool I don't know how accurate it's
gonna be but you know pedometers are
pretty expensive if you really want a
nice one so that being built into it is
pretty cool um gives you like other
stuff like the daughter though you know
where else can get of an auditor google
down yeah but dude that is not accurate
and you know it yeah yeah I haven't
walked only 4 feet in the last two
months yeah that is sewing okay mine
tells me miles Dan you better start
walking it's true I don't walk a lot my
negative i don't understand that I'd so
let's talk about Knox security for for
business users um basically it is going
to allow you to it enables Android se
for certain apps you can have a phone
within the phone you can have your
business phone apps and your private
phone apps and they can be secured from
one another so if you want to run your
business apps alongside your personal
phone so people that are at a place of
business where the business motto is you
bring your own device people that have
to bring their own device to work now
make their IT department happy by not
potentially bringing any type of bad
stuff onto the network you know what
those people could do stop buying
applications from shady Chinese and
Russian markets it's up to the consumers
to make it right it is stop being an
idiot I agree with you a hundred percent
you know okay so yes people can stop
being idiots but but isn't it a cool
feature though that you could turn on
Android se if you want you don't think
it is yeah no I know well I'm sure
Edmonds oh and I'm sure our security
threats are things like this contact
application has access to your contact
list no way this calendar widget has
access to your calendar no bomb yeah
likings are the things that people are
saying our security threats well of
course this widget has access to my
calendar that's the frickin point some
people don't understand it though and
the malware only is a problem when
you're getting crap out of shady Chinese
in Russian markets where they don't have
the opportunity to purchase things
legitimately through google play uh that
i like the shady markets it's like the
black market of phones alright so what
other s features don't dilly dilly did
we talk about everything and there's
there they pretty much asked all the
things
they they didn't told you not to use
that um so there's s adapt display which
s adapt display basically means it's
going to adapt based on the light needed
to the display look good it's a
marketing I mean it's a marketing term
these already these already do that you
know the brightness levels auto
brightness it's not this exact same
thing as auto brightness but for lack of
better words yeah it really does it's
been a way that they do it one of the
okay I missed a feature and it is a
feature the screen is glove friendly so
if you live in an area that gets cold in
the wintertime like right now outside
here in PA which 20-some degrees I could
if I walk outside the gloves on the old
droid DNA doesn't allow me to use it if
I'm wearing gloves if I had the s4 I
could sit here with gloves on and touch
the screen all i wanted to apparently
you doesn't mean it work underwater
adalah with the touch screens does that
mean it works better underwater yes
Scott its scuba diver friendly well no
no I I I mean like shut up oh great
marketing scheme you know we forgot we
forgot another ESCA guys we forgot s
album no I'm just kidding it's called
story album oh my god which which
reminds me of HTC Zoe it's you know it
it's similar to that where you you take
a whole bunch of pictures one day and
you get a notification in the
notification bar saying hey look on this
date you took ten pictures do you want
to group them together in an album and
you say yes and then you can choose an
album cover photo now that's nice have
you taken a whole lot of pictures with
your 13 megapixel camera okay all in all
overall impression personally bloatware
to the max and i like the hardware i
would wipe it and then say goodbye just
like I would with buying a brand new pc
or something if you buy something you
know loaded with bloatware from the
store
I pit put your own stuff on there say
goodbye to the bloat our phones turning
into this is root going to be the norm
for everybody to do at least for the
visitors people it all all the tech
people or yeah are gonna it's gonna grow
but it's disappointing yeah and all the
people that don't know anything are
gonna love it yeah joe joe hindy ass we
talked about so you know we didn't talk
about a racer drama shot but we just
talked about homesync we don't want no
drama in Smart Switch smarts which is
cool if you're coming from an iphone if
you're really coming from another
android phone moving your contacts over
in your pictures aren't really a big
deal because your picture should be
synced to the cloud anyways you're
probably you think to Samsung Nick yeah
well yeah you're you're right sorry up
just in case you didn't sign in with
your gmail account if you're moving over
from an existing Android phone that you
use Google services properly it's not
that big of a deal if you are on a phone
that did not do that or you are coming
from an iphone they have Swartz which
which is software you install on your
computer to help you switch smartly to
the new galaxy just like pies which is
awesome right so and will anybody have
anything exciting to say about drama
shot or eraser we don't want no drama
that's what I gotta say it's it's a
feature alert it's yeah I mean they're
cool don't get me wrong but they're
their camera features they have cool
names because there's an S in four of
them and the features if they were fully
baked and we're a little bit more less
gimmicky and actually works to the way
that you wanted to they'd be awesome but
right now they're not really that now
one thing about the camera that I that
we should mention is it does come with
photosphere but it's called 360 photo
God co Samsung rebranded it because it
does come with the latest version of
Android 4.2 point2 so it does have
photosphere capabilities
but Samsung since they have a highly
customized you know a camera app if they
woulda noticed with is a camera that you
know the galaxy camera yes they
integrated a lot of that stuff into the
actual camera app which I thought was
really cool and I thought that was good
a little bit pretty Stewart of them not
to I agree but I I'm happy that they
actually didn't wait for the next one so
yeah okay so let's talk about some
comparisons week on did a little bit of
comparisons um so right now the latest
phone from HTC the one you know people
are going to be wondering which one they
should get in the next month or two
whenever they become available should
they begin the s4 should they be getting
the HTC One obviously none of us here
have touched any of them held inning
them done actual device reviews right
now as we're speaking looky here for
your fan of the show you know who he is
Christopher walk as well as Joshua
Vergara right now at the Samsung event
and they're doing various vs. videos for
you guys to let you know which one's
better here and there they're doing
versus against existing phones such as
the s3 the note to the DNA nexus for
things like that so you guys can see a
comparison but for phones that are yet
to come out like the HTC One you know
there's there's a big bit of a
difference between the two I mean the
display you're talking about minda both
HD displays but the samsung one is a
little bit bigger 4.99 and 4.7 that's
actually that's enough that you can
notice HTC one is a little bit slower
1.7 gigahertz they basically have the
same same amount of storage space 32 gig
or 64 gig now the s4 you can go 16 gigs
you can get one smaller and cheaper same
amount of RAM camera is a toss-up
obviously because they use different
things different marketing terms the
ultrapixel you know versus the
13-megapixel i'm sure i haven't seen any
renders yet well i'm sure they're the
guys that are making the videos right
now or taking pictures and doing tests
everything to see actually how the
13-megapixel camera pans out the ds4 a
little bigger battery then the note has
a 2300 I'm sorry then up to note the one
yeah HTC One has it 2300 milliamp hour
battery um so wireless charging we don't
know yet definitely the HTC one does not
have it the galaxy s4 was rumored to
come within different case to add
wireless charging that hasn't been
announced yet I don't know if that is
coming or not we're gonna have to wait a
little bit on that still I guess a
little new um now besides that the third
they're both fairly thin devices the
galaxy s4 is a little bit thinner by a
little over a millimeter they're
basically about the exact same width and
height though just a millimeter here and
there but it is a little tikes a little
thinner and it's a little bit lighter
coming in at 130 grams where the one is
143 grams so it's a little bit lighter
now that's cuz plastic is cheap I mean
like what plastic is lying exactly an
HTC One is a is made out of metal it's a
high quality device so so let's without
either of us in here holding a galaxy s4
holding an HTC One if you had to choose
between the two based on what we know
hardware-wise spec wise based on what we
know software wise and what initial
impressions have been from people that
have actually held the devices stock
wait no operations what the what did how
the device comes out of the box okay
which one would you prefer which one do
you want which one has you excited HTC
HTC why some premium device that I mean
from everything I've seen it looks like
it's going to be a very premium device
I've seen similarly constructed devices
from HTC and held them and they have
been amongst the highest quality devices
I I've held far better than an iphone
better than the
for which is also a very premium feeling
highs whereas the Samsung is plastic or
cheap plastic from Samsung like
seriously get off the plastic train it's
cheap it's it it just makes the device
feel cheap right like it just doesn't
even feel like it's in the same class
you've been hit all those facts are in
the same class it just doesn't feel like
a premium to ice now John you have a
note to right now you're currently on
the Samsung train so if you had to get a
new device would you go with the Samsung
train again or would you jump over to
the the one I can't say that I would
jump on the s4 and I look at the s4 now
and I'm not really jealous of it in any
form of facet but I bought my note for a
very specific purpose in that I was kind
of worried about the DNA as far as
developer support and I knew the note 2
would get it and Verizon just doesn't
have many attractive options the one
thing I would say to the community is
that after seeing all these specs in
Bullitt where and all these progressions
and nothing about TouchWiz is really
Giroud or changed this is something the
community has to address with Samsung
this is when plur would blur got out of
hand the community chastised motorola
you know extremely when LG got out of
hand when samsung get on the hand in the
past so if you want this to change by
the time that their next phone comes out
you need to be vocal about it and you
need to not reward samsung for putting
them out putting out his garbage yeah
that's hard as it is asleep and the
hardware is good but you can't you know
they're just they're software just isn't
good yeah the community has to get
active and tell Samsung look something's
got to give yeah because if they keep
selling millions and millions and
millions of devices they're gonna say
hey this is working this is working
let's add more stuff because that's what
sells it and you know and when somebody
said if I say I like my note 2 that
doesn't mean that I like every software
feature that they pack into it I like
the device that doesn't mean I love
touch with ya in touch with still looks
like it did in Gingerbread like it
seriously has not changed yeah that is
very true it just look identical to what
it looked like yeah there's nothing
that's changed there's more icons yeah
all right so vivid brightness for him
down your eyes so know how many how many
apps stock and icons it has that would
be interesting stock icons yeah i'm
gonna go with zero it's todo out of the
box how many are there like like how
many apps and icons oh I got you I don't
have a niche crab is installed on that
device when you track compared to like a
nexus phone or a you know like that'd be
interesting done nexus 10 you know how
big that rom is so waiting to welcome
Nexus no to wrong stock rom for a mines
verizon but still is about nine hundred
fifty megabytes versus a you know
compiled AOSP rom plus a package of
google apps being in the 300 or so range
so you're talking three times as much
software as comes on ace that's about
how this droid DNA as it comes with nine
hundred and some meg of Awesomeness
alright so so so Scott what am I here in
here you uh you on the Samsung ship or
the HTC ship oh I've never owned I've
never owned like a high quality metal
device so i don't know how those feel
but uh base metal based off specs i
would go with the s4 and wipe it but if
we're doing just out of the box without
wiping i would go HTC well i have the
droid DNA which I know was talking about
this earlier with Russell Holly from
geek calm and he kind of made fun of me
when I said that I already have the HTC
One I mean I I I don't I have the droid
DNA running a sense 5.0 wrong then it
comes exactly with the HTC One so and
the screens a little bit bigger and
there's a
plastic and it's not metal but for all
intensive purposes to me if you held the
two devices 10 feet away you'd be hey
look there's two devices that are
exactly the same and very end similar
hardware I'm you know internals cameras
or cameras going to be different
obviously you know there's no
ultrapixels in the end the DNA you know
but I like HTC devices I it's a
well-built phone I mean I hate this film
I hate it but it is a well-built foam so
my incredible I loved my incredible I
would love the HTC One I really would
but I don't I can't run a custom UI I'm
sorry I can't run skinned Android you
know custom ui's I sense TouchWiz I
can't do that so i would need something
that would be supported and i think that
the galaxy s4 would have better support
than HTC one just because HTC is hard
for developers to to get a 0 SS AOSP to
work on so i would choose the galaxy s4
for routing and Rahming customization
capabilities uh how about how about you
Dan I mean you're a colonel dev do you
oh you used to be another life do you
agree with that that HTC's will probably
be harder to get a custom rom on well
they are releasing an unlocked developer
edition that supposed to go on sale in
the US at the same time as the device
goes up for general availability so that
might help things I kinda doubt it I
mean really the issue isn't so much King
the device unlocked it's getting past
all of the ridiculous stuff that HTC
changes with no reason and I don't see
that changing so if you're going to root
an enrollment it's all about the advil
on some box I don't see you know I don't
I just don't see it getting the same
kind of support that the Samsung
pain is made because I think Samsung
makes very crappy devices and I think it
just makes very very high quality
devices but it's a real pain for a
developer for getting the custom robbing
and Colonel seen to deal with HTC
devices anymore they just keep making it
harder so does not so so I'm gonna go
with that and I'm gonna say if I Ward
get this device or if I were to get new
device in the next two months or
whenever it comes out I would probably
go for the s4 that's if you're into root
and rom and that then and that's just me
now the one looks like it's going to be
a gorgeous device you know it's you know
it's cut from metal it's not plastic and
I I don't know obviously we have to wait
two people to get the review and it's
actually android authority should have a
review unit coming home tonight I
believe they come they leave tonight
with them either way we're going to hang
we're going to have one soon so we'll be
able to get some hands-on Xin full
reviews here if you were also also gonna
give away oh yeah that's right yeah so
if you haven't entered into our
international giveaway just go to
android authority com it'll be the very
first post the top of the page it's a
featured post it'll say samsung galaxy
s4 international giveaway of awesome
there I don't think it actually says it
says that this is ! yeah so you go there
and you don't have you know you don't
have to like us tweet us circle is hula
hoop us you know whatever you're not to
do anything crazy all you gotta do is
leave a comment and in the contest if
you want to leave the comment a comment

Anderson post I don't know its crew
actually now does it doesn't do anything
so it does affect it weighs it so
anything else about the galaxy s2 you
guys are that are watching live right
now you have any questions that you want
us to answer there's no a lot of
comments agreeing with sandhya and so
forth but would you like us to you know
hone in on something that you
on our opinion on here before we wrap up
for the evening Andrew darling wants to
state that uh he wants us to touch on
the fact that Samsung decide to keep the
removable battery option uh and that is
awesome I do like that that's something
that you know that was a kind of a a
haha towards other manufacturers you
know that are yeah that are going the
different route try the other I think
they're trying to keep it you know
choice and they want to wipe all their
software and run a custom wrong then
they have choice to do that I think
Samsung's gonna run into some problems
with that because there's increasing
regulations coming up reach the world
that are making it less and less okay to
have removable batteries in mobile
devices so they're gonna have to start
probably changing their strategy on that
a little bit as those regulations take
hold no I did see a comment in question
about my cat she is a staple for the
show now like honestly if she isn't
laying on this chair she's probably dead
is your wife mella then then she always
got I used to block her out I used to
not let her come down here cuz she'd sit
here in the chair the whole time but
then I started realizing the internet
loves cats so I'm just gonna let her do
this okay let her come down here every
show and lay right there in that chair
for those of you listening there's a
chair and there's cat is always laying
on socializing uh her name is Sahara and
that's named after my dog River you know
since her did you know so we had to have
you know had to do that you know
different slippers in the Sahara you had
to be that guy didn't you hey that's
what I do dogs with my comments alright
so anything else dan did we have any
awesome patent news this week or any
carrier news we're talking about what
about that what about that t-mobile week
we had about the trade ins i think
that's that's pretty interesting so
t-mobile has a new trading plan they're
going to launch where if you have a
device that you you want to trade in
their eye she give you a credit for us
you you bring your own device into
tmobile store or you do a male in a
mailer and you can get a credit it
obviously depends on the age of the
vice what device it is but if you're
switching to t-mobile the uncarrier
they're now going to give you money for
giving them your old device which is
cool you know help bring the cost down
of of your monthly payments for the
first month or so quickly and another
comment from Andrew darling basically he
was commenting on the 128 gigabyte a
size now is there any limit to share NFC
files sighs you're not sharing the NFC
no no I I understand that but if you're
doing over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi direct is
there any limit don't believe so I think
you're only limited by the capacity oh
yeah so NFC or as a beam excused as a
front-end to Wi-Fi direct to create the
connection and once it's connected I
mean it's just a yes Wi-Fi connection I
I'd you know what I'm gonna say I don't
know if there's a limit I've never heard
of it I've also never tried to send a
six gig file so the only limit on it
would be an artificially imposed one
there's no theoretical at all yeah well
yeah it's just a tad hoc network that
you crave once it's created you can do
whatever you want with it send one
kilobyte orts and a gajillion megabytes
or terabytes or pewter bikes if you
wants here that's actually a weekend
project dan so everyone's getting
homework this week's I if you have two
devices uh whether that are these
homeworks for you yeah Andrew so a few
two devices tablet phones whatever I
want you to take your largest legally
obtained six gigabyte movie and transfer
but some are bad and transfer to where I
can't easily obtain something that's
gonna loose file format I just want to
see see how see if it's even let you do
it I've I've only transferred you know
pictures you know I've never transferred
anything besides there are a couple Meg
movie definitely interesting though if
you could hit a wall there yeah but I
mean who's gonna happen and the thing is
the file can't be bigger than 64 gigs
because if it is and it's gonna be on
two partitions and yeah yeah that no
obviously I mean the lives there are
reports they aren't transfer protocol
based yeah
alright so Scott want to wrap things up
