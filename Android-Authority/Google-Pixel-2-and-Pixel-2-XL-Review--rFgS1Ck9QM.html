and the pixel 2 follows up on the
original by kind of adding to the
formula on a phone that was supposed to
be the official home for Android and it
was Google's first foray into the
hardware game and there's something that
I really want to emphasize when it comes
to my review of this the pixel 2 XL and
the pixel 2 it's the fact that it's not
really about how many features you're
getting and the sheer number of things
that you can do with the phone it's more
about the experience and if you will the
texture I've drawn the design is the
first thing you're going to notice about
this device it is immensely better than
last year's pixel which had a very
slippery metal and that large glass
panel on the top that people weren't
really all that sure about this year the
glass panel is minimized it only takes
up maybe a fifth of the top of the
device and then below it is a metal body
that actually has been treated to have a
texture to it
it's not just smooth metal and it grips
very well in the hands making it a lot
less slippery than last year's pixel
which really helps in the handling
Department it's one of those tiny
changes that Google put into this phone
that make all the difference so we think
these phones look pretty damn good and
if you want to protect your investment
and keep the phone from scuffing from
general wear and tear then you might
want to invest in these minimal cases
they are incredibly thin add no bulk to
the device and if you look at this
particular case it's a way to bring back
the really blue color that we don't have
in this year's generation of phones
things kind of do change up when you get
to the front of the device the pixel 2
looks a lot like a smaller Nexus 6p in
that it is perfectly symmetrical and has
quite a bit of room at the forehead and
the chin above and below the screen for
both of these devices the forehead and
the chin how's the front facing speakers
which is a great addition that proves to
be really useful especially when gaming
but unfortunately with all of this
goodness so far there had to be a
sacrifice and the main sacrifice that a
lot of you out there will probably be
calling this phone out on is the lack of
a headphone jack losing the headphone
jack means that using one's favorite
headphones might be a little bit of a
chore this time around we do suggest
that you just keep the adapter connected
to your favorite pair so it's always
available but those few times when our
Bluetooth wireless headphones may have
run out of battery did proved to be a
little bit troublesome especially when
we didn't have our
favorite wired earphones on hand one
final thing to mention about the design
here the sides are pressure sensitive
that's kind of a fancy way for me saying
that you can squeeze the device the
squeeze feature is not entirely new and
on the pixels they only activate Google
assistance it might have been nice to
have a different function for here that
is user programmable but at least Google
assistant is incredibly useful and if
you are in Google assistance pretty
constantly this is the best way to
trigger it the smaller pixel 2 is
obviously the easier to handle device
but it does have a lower resolution at
Full HD which might be a bit of a
problem for those of you who are really
into virtual reality on the other hand
you do have the 18 by 9 aspect ratio
display of the pixel to XL which comes
in a quad HD resolution the main
addition to these displays other than
the 18 by 9 aspect ratio for the XL is
the addition of an always-on display but
there are a couple of issues when it
comes to mainly the saturation and also
a bit of the color reproduction on the
pixel to XL
even though these are OLED displays for
whatever reason the saturation on the
pixel to XL is a little bit dialed down
you're not going to be seeing the kind
of color reproduction that you might be
used to on samsung devices where it's
incredibly vivid instead you're gonna
get a much more accurate display which
is what Google is trying to remind
everybody they were trying to do with
this device but there is another problem
here with the viewing angles it's been a
long time since we've talked about
viewing angles as a problem on a device
but even when you move the device at a
somewhat acute angle it doesn't even
have to go that far you notice a cooling
effect on all of the colors here almost
like a blue tint now this is something
that might really bother some users out
there but giving them the benefit of the
doubt we don't think that really too
many people are going to be that
bothered by this issue playing games
watching videos and looking at the
screen dead on when looking at media or
anything that is colorful we really
didn't notice that much of a difference
when it came to the saturation the
experience was still enjoyable so keep
that in mind there might be some issues
with the display but it's not really
going to change your daily usage and
this might not come as much of a
surprise but performance has not been an
issue with the pixel 2 and the pixel 2
XL you have everything that you would
need inside of these devices including
the snapdragon 835 4 gigabytes of RAM
which is utilized beautifully by the
optimized version of
Android Oreo in here and you have
different storage options depending on
how much you pay for the device there's
no SD card slot in here but it does help
that google photos is included on here
and it allows you to upload original
resolution files whether they're photo
or video so you can save up space pretty
easily multitasking in particular gets
high marks not only because of the multi
window that we've enjoyed on this before
but with picture-in-picture which is now
a feature of android 8.0 not only are
you able to use maps in the corner of
your screen while you're doing other
things you can also do that with YouTube
which is what I've been doing the most
the smaller pixel too obviously has the
smaller battery but it does still get
through a full day's work without any
problems it just might have less screen
on time than the pixel to excel in my
case I've been getting pretty
consistently five hours of screen on
time on here with mildly heavy usage
like I said before I have YouTube videos
playing all the time and of course you
can use the included charger for power
delivery charging or you can use qc3 in
order to top-up the battery when you
need it the rest of the hardware is
pretty much what you would expect - the
headphone jack you have everything that
you might need here including NFC and
even IP certifications so that this
phone can take a tumble or a dip without
even breaking a sweat so as the story
goes texture continues to be the name of
the game for these pixels you're not
getting a huge amount of features in
these phones but all the stuff that you
do get is not only optimized they also
work incredibly well the performance is
where it should be even though you only
get four gigabytes of RAM and really the
optimized version of Android makes all
the difference in utilizing everything
the pixels can offer which brings us to
the cameras which is another really
optimized part of the pixels now you're
not going to get dual cameras on the
back of this device you're only getting
one lens however Google is really trying
to optimize it as much as possible so
that you can get the best quality photos
right now you're watching footage full
HD resolution footage from the front
facing camera which is itself a
wonderful performer right now I'm
actually using it just on my vlogging
rig and you can see that the quality is
actually pretty great one thing I should
mention though is that the audio you're
hearing right now is coming from an
external recorder and that's because the
audio from the phone sounds like this
it's not the best audio that we've heard
might be one of the main source pots
when it comes to recording video on
these devices because there are a couple
other things that have been added on
like OAS and also a portrait mode on the
front-facing camera audio is really just
a small blemish on what is overall a
pretty good package but using this
camera as a vlogging rake has been
pretty nice because the front-facing
camera allows for pretty high quality
video but of course you want to see what
the rear camera looks like and there you
go
4k video recording on the rear camera of
the pixel - it does a good job of
providing good quality video with a
little bit of blotchiness and grain
especially in low-light situations by
the main source pod like I said already
is the audio but if you want to talk
about detail you definitely want to talk
about the still images the camera
application works pretty much the same
way as it did in last year's pixel only
there is a replacement lens blur is now
portrait mode and yes this is a portrait
mode that only uses one lens and it does
not need to have a secondary zoom lens
and it works on both cameras in either
case it will take two pictures one with
the artificial bouquet effect and one
without it that way you can take your
pick
but the portrait mode does a really good
job of actually cutting out the
foreground subjects there were only a
few times that we saw the cut be
incorrect overall the portrait mode is
going to be one of those crowd-pleasing
features that selfie experts or rather
selfie enthusiasts are going to really
enjoy pictures in general have turned
out really great with wonderful detail
and good saturation that have been added
in due to the always-on HDR plus mode
there aren't really any manual controls
to speak of here but this might be the
best auto shooter that we have ever used
essentially what the HDR plus mode does
is it takes a bunch of photos at the
same time then uses all of that data in
order to create the best possible final
product this is really useful even in
low-light situations where the shutter
doesn't even stay open for very long the
shutter to file speed is still pretty
high in low-light situations and it's
just basically telling you just trust me
I'll get you the photo you want so if
you're a shutterbug and you're looking
at the pixel - as your potential next
device the rear camera got the
enhancements that it should get after
last year's pixel but it's really the
front facing camera that puts the icing
on the cake with that portrait mode that
you can use for all of your selfies and
finally let's talk about the software
which but there really isn't a whole lot
else that we can say other than this is
the way Android was meant to be all of
the different features that you get in
Android 8 are over all practical and are
things that we would use everyday
like picture-in-picture there are a
couple of other features that have been
added in like the always-on display
having a now playing feature that pulls
from a database of songs so that when it
can recognize that there is music
playing it will be able to tell you what
that song is so if now playing is
displaying a song down here and you get
into the phone it'll either give you a
card that provides you with the name of
the song if it's in the database or it
would just send you to a Google search
so you can find out for yourself and
speaking of Google searches well we have
google lens but it's not really all the
way here yet google lens still has yet
to make it to Google assistant but this
is the way it works in Google Photos any
photos that you already have in Google
photos can be scanned maybe a bit of OCR
text recognition and maybe a backwards
image search and it will try to tell you
what it is you're looking at it works
maybe half of the time and some of the
results were pretty impressive like when
it read the text on my shirt and then it
gave me a Google search leading me
straight to the restaurant that I was
reppin and as I've been alluding to this
entire review it's really about the user
experience of Android and the daily
usage of this operating system that
ultimately is its best when it's on a
pixel the pixel to launcher for example
is even cleaner than before and putting
the search bar on the bottom of it makes
it easy to access for all of those
people who do Google searches all the
time and then of course we have the
squeeze feature which is the best way of
getting to Google assistant from pretty
much any part of the phone even when the
screen is off so if you're looking at it
from just a pure speck and feature
standpoint then pixel to and the pixel
to excel are going to fall just below
all of the other flagships this year but
that's not necessarily a bad thing
because empirically it does lack a
little bit compared to a note 8 or a V
30 if you're coming from a previous
pixel then the story is nice and short
here the pixel twos look better
perform better shoot better and simply
do better than the previous generation
but especially if you're an Android
purist
and you prefer optimization over sheer
numbers of features well then the pixel
2 is the best way of enjoying Android
and it is definitely the way that
Android was meant to be as always thank
you guys very much for watching and I
hope you enjoyed this review of the
pixel 2 and the pixel 2 XL I kind of
just wanted to gush you a little bit
about how much I enjoy these devices
because honestly they are a lot of fun
and whether or not they are actually
better than other flagships kind of
depends on what your
EADS are but if you're just looking for
a smartphone that simply works and gives
you the best version of Android well you
don't really have to look any further
