of Android coming from the cult of the
iPhone one of the first few things that
you'd like to do before casting your
iPhone into the fiery flames is to
transfer your data especially your
contacts to your new phone it is very
easy to do
transferring contacts I mean
hello I'm mark welcome to Android
Authority in this video I'll show you
how to transfer your iPhone contacts to
your Android phone there are several
ways and they are very easy the most
obvious and simplest way is through the
iPhone contacts app just open a contact
page scroll down tap on share contact
and choose whether to send the contact
info by email or messaging this method
works quite well but what if we have
hundreds or maybe thousands of contacts
to transfer to Android you will need a
more robust method there are actually
several let's start off with Apple's own
device and media manager software I
choose obviously you'll need iTunes for
this so make sure that your computer has
the latest installed you'll also need a
Google account and the computer you're
using must be connected to the internet
first connect your iPhone to the
computer using apples proprietary USB
cable on the iTunes window you should
see your connected phone click on it to
view the device summary page click the
info tab at the top look for sync
contacts with and place a checkmark
beside it choose Google contacts from
the drop down menu if this is your first
time to specify a Google account you
will be asked to provide your Google ID
and password or if you've already set a
Google account before and you want to
configure it click this button once
everything is set click apply iTunes
will now sync your iPhone contacts to
your Google account the nice thing about
this method is that each time you plug
in your iPhone to your computer iTunes
will automatically sync and update your
contacts to your Google account let's
now check whether my contacts have been
stored in my Google account yup they're
all here the final step is to sync my
Google account contacts with my Android
phone to do that
I only need to set up and login to my
Google account on my Android phone and
after a little while all my contacts
will be synced another method for
transferring contacts from iPhone to
Android requires Apple's iCloud service
this one's an entirely web-based
operation no need for USB Kay
but you'll need a computer for this one
first launch your web browser on your
computer and log in to your iCloud
account click on contacts to view a list
of your contacts next select the
contacts that you wish to export you can
select just one contact several contacts
or all contacts at once then open the
settings menu and select export vCard
your computer will download a VCF file
save it to a convenient location this
file holds a copy of all your contacts
you can then import the VCF file into
your Google contacts using a browser or
you can copy the file to your phone's
internal storage and thereafter import
the file to your phone's people or
contacts app you can also transfer your
iPhone contacts to Android with the help
of apps such as the my contacts backup
app it is available in the App Store
just launch the app on your iPhone tap
the backup button to make a VCF backup
of your contacts now you'll need a way
to send this VCF file to your Android
phone for that just tap email to attach
the VCF file to an email message then
send it to your gmail address on your
Android phone download the email with
the attached VCF file download the file
and import its content to your phone
very easy huh another interesting app to
use as bump it lets you share contacts
and files by simply bumping two devices
together that must be installed in both
phones you also need an active internet
connection
launch bump on both phones grant
permissions when prompted on the sender
device the iPhone in this case swipe to
the right until you reach the contacts
section mark those contacts that you
want to share afterwards bump the two
phones together like this on the pop-up
dialog that appears on both phone
screens tap connect to let the two
devices communicate and their my iphone
contacts have been sent over to my
android although the iphone and android
seemed to be worlds apart they're not
separated from each other by an
impermeable membrane as I've just
demonstrated it's possible to swap or
share data such as contacts but
the two platforms I just showed you how
the transfer contacts from your iPhone
to your Android phone I hope you find
