to make audio the focus of an otherwise
mid-range smartphone this is Josh regard
from Android authority what's going on
everybody
and this is the Marshall London we start
off with the design which was fully
created by Marshall itself and takes on
quite a bit of the company's iconic
looks
Marshalls nice logo is down below at the
4.7 inch display just above one of the
two front facing speakers and a white
line outlines all the bits of the
Front's before moving on to the sides
this is where we feel the rubberized
material that men you may know from
Marshalls famous amps and speakers and
it provides a great grip and feel for
this phone on the right the power button
is a little higher up on the body with a
volume roller below it yes this is an
analogue style dial that can be used for
further functionality when pressed in
and up top is the main draw of the
Marshall 2 audio jacks that can be used
for both recording and listening with a
large circular Marshall button in the
middle used in order to trigger the
official music application and as we
move to the back the rubberized material
continues and also makes for removable
backing underneath that backing are the
micro SD and nano SIM card trace along
with a replaceable battery which
actually says on it long live rock and
roll all in all we enjoy how unique the
design of the Marshall London is the
Marshall has done a great job in
translating their iconic amp designs
into the smartphone world and with a 4.7
inch display handling is about as good
as it can get even if the screen is a
little smaller additions of the front
facing speakers add girth without making
the phone harder to use in one hand the
removable backing though is a little
thinner and flimsier than we would like
as it might be easily broken and it's
latches could crack which would then
make it unusable but small touches like
the volume dial make it clear that
Marshall wanted you to know that they
made this phone and it truly shows a 4.7
inch IPS display comes in at 720p
resolution for the Marshall London and
it is the first sign of the phone's
decidedly mid-range specifications that
said it isn't a bad display by any means
but it is important to know that it's
not meant to be a flagship competitor
especially when at its highest
brightness the display shows a
noticeable warm hue over everything
making the white areas look a little
more taupe the brightness makes the
screen more readable in broad daylight
but it actually isn't as bright as other
IPS displays that we've seen and with
the lower resolution
in some places like text are definitely
lower here compared to any 1080p
displays that said we don't think that
720 is at all terrible for typical daily
usage is just considered the lowest tier
display experience now this mid to low
range trend continues in a performance
aspect as we have the Snapdragon 410 at
the helm backed by the audrina 306 and
two gigabytes of RAM it should already
be expected that this processing package
will not bring the snappiest or even the
smoothest performance and this has
definitely been the case with us even
going through the general UI stutters
and small bits of lag or common we do
think that with the lower specifications
all around though the Snapdragon 410 is
able to perform as well as it possibly
can without being stretched by things
like a full HD display but higher demand
tasks like games brought expected issues
with long load times and periodic
crashes for typical tasks we were able
to get work and some play done but we
needed to get used to the time at might
end up taking to just open the app or
even just do the job that it needs to do
a mostly stock like Android gets some of
the credit for the bit of speed that we
do feel here as Marshall doesn't try too
hard to make Android overtly different
that it slows it down too much but even
then you should just know that you're
getting some mid to low tier performance
out of the Marshall London and in
Hardware the main component is the audio
but we'll get to that in a little bit we
start off with the removable back and
what is underneath it a micro SD card
slot mainly this means that the 16
gigabytes of on-board storage can be
bolstered and thus all of your high
quality audio files will have a place to
stay when the phone is too full the
battery is a twenty five hundred million
power unit which is a good capacity when
you consider the lower overall
specifications and it actually works
quite well one of the best days that we
had with the Marshall London though it
was a little bit rare was an almost four
hour screen on time that was used over
the course of a 14 hour day couple that
with the fact that the battery is
replaceable and you can find that this
phone can go the distance NFC is missing
from the connection suite but there is
also one other thing to remember about
this phone it is currently not made for
the Americas and must be imported and
that means that mobile data connections
will be on HSPA+ for GSM networks here
in the United States so if you're going
to buy this phone abroad just know that
LTE connectivity won't be possible when
you make it back home which brings us to
audio starting off with the front-facing
speakers which work really well marshall
manages to not only make a stereo setup
but they also gave the audio a good
amount of body and thus we didn't feel
the need to get the headphones out for
gaming or even when sharing videos on
YouTube with friends which is always
nice
and finally we go to the headphone jacks
up top yes this phone allows for full-on
sharing of audio and music with a friend
using the built-in cirrus logic sound
card that provides full connectivity to
both jacks if you do indeed have someone
to share your music with this ensures
that both people will get the highest
quality possible-- including independent
volume controls one quick thing though I
am no musician which means that the
recording aspect of this phone wasn't
something that would be used by someone
like me the Marshall app does afford
users control over how the audio sounds
whether in the speakers or in the
headphones and it does a great job the
settings in the equalizer pretty
dramatically changed what is already a
very warm sounding sound stage that is
evened out at first but then is easily
manipulated if you want more low-end
bass for hip-hop for example or
higher-end peaks for things like dialog
so in all respects the audio experience
in the marshall is great and robust
definitely in line with the history of
the company itself it will be even
better if you put some lossless audio on
here like flag files to fully take
advantage of the audio card built into
the phone but even then you will have a
great time enjoying music more so if you
have someone to share them with the
camera of the Marshall London is an 8
megapixel shooter with a 2 megapixel
front-facing companion and it falls in
line with all of the lower
specifications that we found outside of
the audio experience the app uses the
general google camera and that means
Lens Blur photosphere and HDR shooting
are all available but it doesn't add
toward us otherwise a lackluster
picture-taking experience shooting what
the camera does take a bit of time which
shots sometimes taking a solid second to
finish capturing especially if you have
HDR on and it shows in the actual
pictures which are all fairly washed out
without capturing enough detail to make
the pictures even look sharp color
reproduction is actually pretty good but
that's about it because there is a bit
of punch added into the colors but
overall we didn't find too many great
photos unless we were in very highly lit
situations if you are a social media
picture taker this might be best
considered as a bare minimum camera
experience to capture memories it can
get the job done but it's certainly no
overachiever and finally in software we
have Marshall at the helm of what is
mostly a stock version of Android
Marshall focused on making specific
applications that add into the
experience rather than changing the core
there are a couple little additions like
the power up and down animations and a
very nice guitar rift that is used for
notifications lollipop then brings the
tip
homescreens app drawer and notification
drop-down with the quick settings panel
marshals applications include the
dedicated audio app which we already
mentioned is where the equalizer can be
changed for a better audio experience
but it is also able to tap into various
music apps like Spotify and Google Play
music making itself the way to control
these applications in the beginning we
actually had issues with this app
working properly but after an
application update from the Play Store
it now works pretty flawlessly and even
a loop stack is available for anyone who
wants to make their own music load music
and sound effects into the stack and a
bit of tinkering can make a pretty nice
beats but like I said I'm no musician
from more robust experience in creating
beats there is actually a full-on DJ
application included but finally
Marshall even put in a quirky little
video game called rockabilly Bros where
you manage a band and the venue that
they play at all in all we really liked
that marshal kept Android about a stalk
as they could make it with additions in
the form of applications that are then
updated from the Play Store it not only
keeps the Android iteration as smooth as
it can be given the spec circumstances
but the added applications provide
enough layers to the experience that are
quintessentially Marshalls style the
Marshall London is available in the UK
and further parts of Europe for prices
that translate to roughly 499 dollars or
even more which is actually the
projected price for the phone when it
becomes available in the United States
currently there is only an email alert
in place in which Marshall will tell you
when the London is finally coming
stateside what happens when an audio
company decides to dive into the world
of smartphones well since the Android
world is so saturated in the cost of
making a mid-range smartphone might not
actually be that high it doesn't
surprise us that companies are able to
specialize for Marshall Audio is their
obvious focus and it shows in the London
sharing the music experience with a
friend is one thing but having even
further control over the audio
experience through equalizers and even
the recording and creation apps makes
the London a benchmark for phones that
are made for audio files but regular
Android users are in a different space
for a phone that is basically a niche
product they had to cut corners and
basically every other aspect and that
means that general Android users might
not find the London as a worthy daily
companion and that's the main problem
here Marshall took a generic otherwise
Android phone and put their stamp on the
design and then put their audio prowess
to work but that just won't be enough to
put this phone in the hands of
more than a select group of users
especially when considering the price
don't get us wrong we absolutely love
what Marshall has done here but
hopefully a follow up will improve the
aspects that truly matter to the Android
faithful on top of where they've already
succeeded greatly as always thank you
guys very much for watching I hope you
enjoyed this review of the Marshall
London I know a lot of you guys were
requesting it after my unboxing and we
got really busy but before I went on my
extended break I wanted to make sure to
get this for review out to you as not
really much of an audio file I can still
enjoy just how great the quality is from
the audio in this phone but for general
Android users it just might not be a
very good companion for daily usage that
said you can keep it tuned here for this
and even more from my colleagues in
Android over on the side and you can
install the Android authority app so
that you can get all of our content and
when you're done with all of that stick
around to Android authority comm because
we are your source for all things
