authority yet again and I wanted to show
you all one of my favorite Twitter apps
probably my favorite the one I'm using
regularly now it's called tweet lanes by
Chris Lacey some of you've probably
heard of him this launcher excuse me I
launcher a twitter app actually came out
a little while ago but i just started
using it I was never really a big
Twitter user and once I got back into
writing I figured well I should get back
in again in case somebody tweets me
something really important you'll see
right here it's got just the coolest
icon this very happy looking bluebird
he's on what appeared to be three orange
lines but when you open it up you'll
really see why I have fallen in love
with it right off the bat it is you know
the Ice Cream Sandwich jelly bean
Android design guidelines top to bottom
we've got all of the holo theme swiping
that you need and it's really really
really a buttery smooth some might say
now he also incorporated a feature
called vol scroll or vole scroll volume
scroll I said it's great for bigger
screens that you can use the volume keys
to actually scroll up and down one tweet
now I'm still an old-school touch guys
so I go up and down but you'll see that
it's very very quick up here you can tap
this I've got my twitter account added
at Josh munos you should certainly add
me I'm trying to become a more active
user you can add an account so you can
support multiple accounts which is very
very cool swipe over and you can see
your profile if you choose to enable
that my location my link all of that
stuff hopping into the settings menu
this is where it really really gets
great I also recommend if you use it now
do free for life he says Chris lacy the
developer says as a development
continues some premium features are
going to be added in but if you get in
early enough those premium features will
be free to you if you simply tap free
for life and send out a tweet that you
know promotes and talks about it anyways
hopping back into the settings menu we
can do holo light or holo dark themes
which is very very cool now this is one
of my favorite favorite parts of tweet
lands the customized lanes
Shin every swipeable you know section in
this app is called Elaine so you'll see
that the ones that I have enabled their
my profile mentions direct messages and
favorites but you can really enable any
combination of these your tweets tweets
that have been retweeted you can't ever
disable the timeline duh and following
and followers so let's just do my tweets
and retweets of me which are probably
not many because I'm not super active
yet as I've mentioned before but all of
a sudden here my tweets just my tweets
and a couple of them talking about tweet
lane you just saw and then retweets of
me oh really liking tweet lanes that was
retweeted that's great and so those are
in front of the timeline now one thing I
would like to see is being able to
rearrange the order that the lanes rain
but I would imagine that this is a
pretty logical order your profile your
tweets retweets of you and then you're
at the actual timeline which is where
things get great also following the
great holo design guidelines is if you
tap the top of the line you hop all the
way back up to the top which is just
great so let's turn off these ones that
I never ever use done I'll font size
very standard stuff here profile image
size medium for me tweet source I've
disabled but you can display the name of
the application just like when you're
looking at twitter com it'll tell you
what the person used to tweet I have
enabled vol scroll which i debuted or I
demonstrated earlier quote format you
can do standard quote retweet with a
comment or via at that person's Twitter
handle you can download images let me
scroll down and see if I can find an
example of this so blaze this guy right
here I might grow up someday but not
today and he's used instagram to upload
a photo so it actually shows a small
preview and then when you tap it it
makes the image preview larger which is
a really really cool feature and i
haven't even gotten to the coolest
feature yet which is what I've been
saving for the end you can empty the
image cache right there filter feed so
you can hide replies or hide retweets I
choose to do neither but at the bottom
this is where tweet lanes really get
special there's not a new tweet box now
obviously I can do a new tweet from this
ball
exit says what's happening but it's
actually a context-sensitive tweet box
so and that if I long press on this guy
for example I get a new context
sensitive menu I can read we do I can
favorite it I can share it through some
form or fashion but the
context-sensitive box actually lets me
reply to him just by long pressing on
his handle now if you want to send a
certain tweet or apply to more than one
user you can actually long press more
than one at a time let's make sure this
works because I know I've done it before
so we can you add I GN let's do come on
at blaze and write their reply to at IGN
and at blaze which is very very cool and
really really makes this in my opinion
one of the best twitter clients on
android if not the best the one thing
that i do have to knock it for is that
there aren't notifications built in yet
but as chris lacey has been working on a
new kind of launcher called action
launcher i believe he hasn't been
developing actively on this and he says
that as soon as action launcher comes
out into a public beta we will see
notifications be coded into tweet lanes
so very very cool twitter app if you're
looking for something new and fresh and
really want something that will use the
design guidelines that android has set
forth it is free it is called tweet
lanes and you can find it in the google
play store</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
