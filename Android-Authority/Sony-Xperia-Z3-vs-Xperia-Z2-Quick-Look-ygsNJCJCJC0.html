Berlin 2014 I wanted to bring you one
that you guys were requesting and to
look at the Xperia z3 versus the Xperia
z2 now we will obviously start with
design but that is where the z3 has its
main upgrades over the Xperia z2 as the
list is a little bit short when it comes
to talking about what has really changed
from one to the other but the z3 as
design does bring a much rounder look
much softer on the sides and in the
frame mostly and that does give it less
rigidity as was found in the Xperia z2
though it wasn't uncomfortable by any
means it just is even better now on the
z3 you do get still the ports on the
sides and after that the design mostly
stays about the same we will have a
better look at the front facing speakers
here as they are a little bit smaller
they're not all the way flush into the
very lines of the phone and they should
still provide a pretty good sound
performance but from there it is a
little bit lighter does e3 is 152 grams
it's something that you will feel when
you compare but for the most part the
feel and the weight still still feels
pretty much the same the z3 underneath
the surface has that 1920 by 1080 P
resolution screen at 5.2 inches which is
largely the same as before and still
brings the same great performance with
the triluminos and x-reality engine but
also the viewing angles are also about
the same which they have already been
improved in the z2 and continue to be
just as good in the z3 the Snapdragon
801 now at 2.5 gigahertz is what you get
here along with 16 or 32 gigabytes of
storage and three gigabytes of RAM so
you will have pretty much the same
performance package but we already knew
it was working really well in the Xperia
UI which is still pretty simplistic and
minimalistic which is what we love about
it and it still maintains a very good
look and performance even with additions
like these small apps and all of these
Sony additions and the applications
which mainly include the PlayStation
connectivity this year or in this
release rather in which you can connect
to your PlayStation 4 and be able to
play your games remotely via these
phones and the tablet that was also
released after that the camera is the
twenty point seven megapixel camera that
you do already probably loved from the
original z2 and it brings all the same
power with a few extra modes built in
and finally in the battery
do get a bump up to a 30 100 million
power units but Sony has really been
Tooting that the battery performance on
here is even better than before and you
should be able to get 2 days on average
out of this phone and we probably want
to be putting it past them because there
are already some great power saving
features that have been a trope of the
Xperia line for quite a while so that's
just this closer look at the Sony Xperia
z3 one compared to the z2 yes we do have
a 6-month release cycle but that doesn't
mean that there aren't some enhancements
here if you already loved the z2
experience then we wouldn't blame you
either way if you decided to not go to
the next one or if you decided to go to
the z3 because you want that updated
look and feel so keep it tuned here at
Android 30 for our future review of the
Xperia z3 and remember that we are your
