and I finally got my theis M so I have
heard that apparently you can just go
straight to China with Google Phi and
just get around the Great Firewall so
that's what I'm going to test here I'm
gonna make the see what the speeds are
like in China see if I can access sites
that you normally can't access on just
regular Chinese internet so let's go yes
I also just picked this up on the way
because my computer ran out of storage
so it's a portable SSD so gonna use that
yeah
okay so finally got to Shenzhen it's
been like 19 hours or something I'm very
tired but as you can see on my phone I'm
gonna throw a little pop-up up here it
just says welcome to China as soon as
you walk into China when we own over
Russia is that Vulcan to Russia so even
though if my cellular data off Google
was still kind of able to triangulate
where we were kind of welcomes you to
every country that you pass through an
airspace that's pretty cool so far I've
been able to use the internet with no
problems you can access any website even
once that are blocked by Chinese IP is
like Facebook so I'm gonna talk to Josh
more about this in a bit when I see him
tomorrow so I will talk to you guys then
oh all right
you thought me we I found Josh yeah so
yeah we are gonna talk about project I
in China cuz we're in Shenzhen right now
we wanted to show you the backdrop but
it would blow out the cameras and we
wanted to also film downstairs but they
kind of gave us a little bit of crap for
it but it's okay we're in China and I
was in Shanghai and I came down here to
Shenzhen where David is working on some
Oppo content so yeah obviously for us
being here in China we had to have some
sort of SIM card my original plan was to
come here and get a card here that had
the highest and the most high speeds and
the most data but I think it was you
actually that said you were gonna use
project Phi and you got your card like
literally a day or two before he got
here yeah so Josh was spending some time
in San Francisco with me and I mentioned
that I was getting my Phi sim and then
we started talking about like oh does it
get good speeds and yeah I mean in China
you get LTE like Google has some sort of
weird relationships I did not believe
that when you said because I used
t-mobile for the longest time and even
though it would work in other places you
have to pay for for faster speeds right
so when you said that it would still use
full speeds on there I did some research
I ended up on like Reddit in a few
places and yeah they corroborated what
David said so I'm not only using Phi I'm
using it on the phone that I actually
covered in Shanghai the xiaomi c ami me
makes 2s yeah and yeah as long you can
use this so it's it's so useful it says
so
good look we use Google Drive we use all
these Google services and if you just
use the the Internet at the hotel then
you can't access those so you need a VPN
or you can tether from Project fight and
since they have the bill protection now
and you get unlimited data over six gigs
I haven't really worried about any of
this I just been tethering from my phone
like six or seven I'm six it's at six
okay so the maximum you can pay every
month is $80 okay well for just for
context I I'm connected to it right now
I do have a little bit of a story about
getting it to work with this phone but
you get the project fly app here and of
course it'll tell you how much you've
used now amateur those are amateur
numbers I know you were just raised okay
so I'm up to about two gigs for the
amount of time that I've been here over
the last couple of last number of days
but I've been using this card for the
last like two weeks lucky numbers oh my
goodness
rookie numbers 0.7 there really were
behind it so you up to my ignite bytes
so I was watching a lot of YouTube
that's the thing so obviously you would
want to sort of cater your usage to make
sure you're not paying let us say up the
wazoo
yes but there is bill protection and
it's only $10 more than the unlimited
plan I was already paying for on
t-mobile but then again it doesn't give
you full speeds abroad this does
generally and and in many places and you
know what I would be very I would be I'm
very impressed I would be very impressed
if because Phi is at full speed in China
that means it should be full speed
everywhere right pretty much yeah my god
that's amazing
they just keep upping the number of
countries that they're in I wish I've
had that I've come to China so many
times at one time with Android Authority
and I wish I wish I had this kind of
connectivity here because since as you
said Phi has some sort of deal with
Chinese telex some sort of Chinese
telecom because Google wants to be able
to say we you can go to any country and
it works the same way in every country
and that's it they don't want to be like
oh but in China you can't use any Google
services because that would be very bad
for their branding yeah so what I'm
assuming and I actually reached out to
Google on this I'm waiting first once
right now but I'm assuming they they
have some sort of deal with a local
telecom that like allows them to get
over the Great Firewall
so you're pretty much stable just do
whatever you would do anywhere yeah and
just popping into sim like okay so we're
both using pixels but I'm using this
right now
so I do have my pixel and using the ECM
on there it's really easy the pixel is
probably the most well equipped phone
for this kind of international data
usage because it already has all of the
information that it needs and it can
pull it really easily yeah and of course
you could use the ESM which is kind of
nice right so if you don't know Danny
sim is it's a newer thing that Google
has in the pixel twos that any phone
yeah the only phones that have them
right now but basically it's project
files like embedded in the phone so like
you don't have to get a sim I did
because I like we switch phones a lot
and I if I figured if I'm doing any Oppo
content with an opah phone I want to be
able to just throw it in there yeah
exactly so that was exactly what
happened like you have to I believe you
have to register the sim using a pixel
or you can any project file like
registered device so like there's the
Moto X for there's the there's like a
third I can't remember the other phone
yeah I believe slightly older Nexus
devices our Nexus devices work - yeah or
the the most recent Nexus device yes so
yeah once I got the sim
registered it just popped it into here
and actually okay I had a little bit of
trouble at first because the for
whatever reason it worked once I landed
in Shanghai but then over time it
started to like lose connectivity and
then at some point it just stopped like
it only gave me the emergency calls only
notification or whatever you call that
and I did some research I was getting
really frustrated for about a day
because I was like I brought project
fire here to be able to do this and
finally I realized oh maybe it doesn't
have the information I have to manually
put the access point name I don't know
if maybe I'll put it in the description
below or something like that but if you
if you are traveling abroad and you
don't have the APN you have to go into
your settings to the mobile networks and
do it all manually so it's actually
really easy there's really there's only
a few like lines you have to change on
the APN and then you just put it in and
then it should work after that okay once
I did that finally it was okay so it's
not your mileage might vary there might
be a little bit of a beginning learning
curve or you might have to put some
settings in yourself but once you have
it ready it's yeah great so like it
really depends on your
usage right if you're in the US and you
don't go to other countries very often
t-mobile's unlimited plan might be
better because they it's ten or cheaper
and then they throttle at 22 gigs
whereas five it's unlimited but it
throttles to 128 kilobytes per second at
15 gigs
yeah usage but it's just a lot though 15
is a lot I mean I am at 9 already but
that's because I've been you know
tethered like tethering to my computer
and everything but if you're in the US
you don't travel very often
timo is probably a better option but
like just for us cuz we go we just got
back from MWC you know we were all over
Europe I went to four places in Europe
now we're in China it's just like to not
have to think about it and like I said
before like you fly into another country
and it just says welcome to this country
like ah it's that easy right if you keep
if you keep domestic and you just want
to set it and forget it type of SIM card
or phone service than any of the
unlimited plans back home would be great
but I would argue and maybe this is
something we can talk about in a future
thing and you can also let us know in
the comments down below if you think
this is a good idea I'm actually
planning now to cut my t-mobile because
when I'm at home and I'm in Wi-Fi and
stuff like that maybe I should just
cater my usage so that I can have the
lowest possible bill right so you can't
like if you know you're not gonna travel
internationally that month and you're
not gonna use that much data you can
just if I acted actually actively tries
to find Wi-Fi networks and I think
that's why it's called fie right like
it's aggressively trying to find a Wi-Fi
mm-hmm and so you can really you could
have an incredibly cheap if you use less
than a gig then your bill is gonna be
like $25 twenty-five or thirty dollars
or something like that and I think
that's exactly what I'm going to do
because as long as I'm making I'm making
it might be a little bit painstaking but
I'm as long as I'm making the effort to
download offline and to do all that
stuff then there you go or just be on
Wi-Fi even also if you have a phone that
has a lot of bands like the pixel
because the pixel also works on Verizon
and those kind of networks you can turn
roaming on and roaming is actually free
so if I will actively switch between
whatever networks are the least
congested at the time so in uses
t-mobile as a baseline but then it'll be
it'll jump to sprint and if you turn on
roaming which you have to do in the
settings so not a lot of people know
about it but it's free then it'll
actually roam on Verizon if you don't
have good t-mobile that's really cool
which is amazing because Verizon has a
great coverage and they're fast yeah yes
so so that's I think that's the main
takeaway here is like we we we got
project five Sims to experiment with
them in an international sense yeah and
China is one of the hardest places to
actually access everything you want to
do if you are from outside of China and
sure enough bringing this here it was
like a plug-and-play situation and it
was also easy immediate access to all
Google services and all that so I guess
the takeaway here and you can let us
know what you think in the comments
below and we'll get into some
conversations about you guys what
service do you use and if you're a
project 5 member what if your experience
has been I think the takeaway here is we
use it abroad and it makes us want to
use it at home yeah yeah yeah Wi-Fi most
the time anyway um so it's yeah actually
view in a work environment you're on
Wi-Fi anyway and then like I said just
download offline and it'll it'll cut a
lot of the data that you might end up
using on any given point anyway so yeah
I think there should pretty much do it
there are reactions a project fire broad
Assoc in the Chinese content yes
specifically in China and it's great if
you're gonna come to China if you do a
lot of business and China project 5
might be the best deal you you can like
you can pause your service too so even
if you just know you're gonna come to
China for like a little bit you can
active I to activate a project 5 sim go
to China with your temporary number or
whatever and then you can pause your
service for up to 3 months or you can
just deactivate it and that number just
disappears but it's like whatever and
just exactly activate it at any time
with a different number so the
possibilities are kind of endless there
so yeah I mean this might sound like a
bit of an edge tech not net does not is
not a net for project fight this is
literally how we feel about this service
that I honestly feel like I wish I had
after coming to check cuz I come to
China at least three four times a year
for Hendra thority and I wish I had it
every single one of those times yeah so
yeah yeah I said before let's no
thoughts in the comment section below
and make sure you stay tuned for other
stuff alright so thank you so much for
watching we had our discussion about
project 5 and also don't forget to watch
these Jean
me mix 2's hands-on as well as any
Content that David is doing currently
right now here in China for Oppo and
whatever devices they have yeah that's
coming in too
there's also a couple of things that you
can watch across our different network
so make sure you follow all of those
follow us on social media and yeah that
should pretty much do it so remember
that Andhra Authority is of course your
source for all things project and I
every time sorry every time
