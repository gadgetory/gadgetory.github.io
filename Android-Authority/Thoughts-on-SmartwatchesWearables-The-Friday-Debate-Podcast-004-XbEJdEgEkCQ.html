Friday debate podcast episode number
four yes we are getting we're moving up
in the world a little bit we are now in
our fourth episode as I have trouble
speaking I'm gonna apologize right off
the bat I am of course Joshua Vergara
from android authority what's going on
everybody I'm a little bit under the
weather so hopefully our prestigious
guests are going to be able to pick up
the slack where I may be coughing in the
background I'm joined by two of our
three normal guests and we have one new
guest for today we have Joseph Indy and
jonathan pryce how's it going guys hey
internet even well thank you well they
are both super healthy at the moment so
like I said they're probably going to
talk more than me in this particular
podcast but that's perfectly fine
because I want to give a quick shout-out
to andrew grush our lovely crushy is out
for this week let's just say he ran into
a little bit of trouble and I really
wish he could have been on this podcast
along with the four of us because it
would have been great to hear andrew
grush on meds it was on the podcast he's
a he's got a little bit of a dental
thing going on so best of luck to you
grouchy recover very soon and enjoy the
meds but our fourth today is our fellow
youtuber lon when and I want to go ahead
and hand it over to lon real quick you
know for our viewers on YouTube you may
be watching our podcast video on YouTube
for the benefit of those of you who
aren't on podcast streams just yet but
remember that the android authority
friday debate podcast can be found on
all of the different podcast networks
itunes podcast stitcher we're very close
to soundcloud like I keep saying I
promise that's coming very soon but you
can find it all there but nonetheless
let's hand it over to lon lon won't you
go ahead and introduce yourself to our
podcast listeners and tell us what you
do here at Android authority hey what's
up guys so you some of you guys might
already know me because I I'm part of
the YouTube team and I review phones and
tablets and wearables all that good
stuff so if you guys follow us on the
channel then you've probably seen
lot of my work and you'll probably see
some articles that are right for like
cases and accessories on the site as
well too so and i'm here on the friday
debate this is my second time but it's
good to be here so yeah for for anyone
that may not have followed us since the
beginning here at the friday to pay
podcast lon was on our pilot episode
that we recorded live at CES 2015
speaking of which i do want to say that
nwc is only a couple of weeks away and
we have the distinct pleasure obviously
of being there i will not be there alone
as the sole youtuber this time around
lon will be coming as well so you can
expect a live episode from us we're
probably going to have Darcy la cuvee on
that particular episode as well and
maybe a couple of special guests so it
might be it might be an episode that
gets a little nuts because we have a lot
of people all in one room talking at one
microphone most likely so nonetheless I
want to welcome everybody once again to
the fourth episode of the Friday debate
podcast and this week we're talking
about wearables which is why I think
it's great that we have lawn on the
episode because this is more of a device
centric podcast this time around I'm
going to go ahead and read off our topic
for this week of course created by
Grusha the architect of the Friday
debate every single week on Android or
decom for years now companies have been
claiming that wearables will be the next
big thing not to quote Samsung its 2015
and still wearable devices are niche at
best with apple HTC and likely many
other players entering into the game
this year what will it take for
smartwatches to go mainstream what
features would make you buy one or do
you think that they will always remain
niche now to begin our discussion here
on wearables I am going to hand it over
to lon once again since you are our
guest for this week and I want to ask
you what are your thoughts on wearable
technology um like right now I think
it's kind of I don't know like I don't
think it's really taken off the way that
I think a lot of these OEMs have sort of
wanted to take off and I feel like it's
still like very like the only people i
really want to wear
more like the my people like us like the
techie guys and I don't know I think
it's just it's not it's not having
that's that appeal that that they're
sort of anticipating and I think some of
it has to do with maybe just the
functionality and I don't know because
like for even for me like I don't feel
that compelled to always wear like my
motor 360 all the time because I don't
feel like it really changes my life
drastically and I think for people to
want to buy into these things there has
to be like a big incentive for for them
to use it but that will actually change
the way they use their phones or really
meant the way they use their phones and
I don't really think it's doing that
right now and for me like I would like
to it's probably never going to happen
but I'd like to be able to text from my
phone or text before my SmartWatch
actually be able to like physically
input like messages and not always speak
it out loud but that's probably never
gonna happen but I think if that did
happen i think that would actually sort
of help that would actually make more
people want to adopt one because right
now everything's just kind of like I
don't know it's not it's it's like it's
nice to have but you don't necessarily
have to have it is it's cool to be able
to check the weather on my wrist and
stuff like that but it's almost it's not
that much more difficult for me to pull
my phone in my pocket and just unlock
and look at a widget or something so I
don't know it's just I think that's wise
really hasn't really taken off yet it
just hasn't it's not as compelling as
they're hoping it to be okay how about
you guys Joe and John let's start off
with Joe okay um I think uh I think lon
touched on it the biggest reason when he
said that you know it's there's not
really a use for it like when you look
at other technology that like literally
everybody uses you look at computers and
you look at smartphones they fill a very
huge void that was you know unfilled
before like you know before smart phones
you know the best we could do was play
snake on a nokia phone and like talk and
text with the t9 keyboard those seats
were trash and everybody knows it well
t9 was amazing back in the day
say like I do I love it t nine really
yeah I couldn't i get i'm an idiot so I
could never get figure out exactly how
it worked and it was like by the time i
got a phone that was able to use it it
was like right around the corner was the
QWERTY keyboards so there was like a
good like three or four month window
there where I was trying to use t9 I was
like screw this i'm going qwerty never
went bad love t nine man cuz like that
was like the only time where i was able
to actually text and not look at my
phone yeah exactly you can't do that
nowadays it's hard to like text and not
be able to and not look at your phone
but t9 I was able to do that on the fly
well I'm also one of the greatest things
about t9 was when you could text faster
using t9 stack 89 ABS other other other
youtuber Kevin another got me to review
it for the for a nap once so I do use t9
today but I could not use it back then
and I hated it as a keyboard thing but
anyways back to what I said I didn't
expect someone to jump on me for the t9
things am but yeah no I mean like you
before there were smartphones there was
a huge need for Steven if people didn't
really know it there was a huge need for
smartphones and that's filled such a
huge gap people use smartphones every
day for all kinds of stuff you know the
social media and the phone calls and
texts in the games and a whole bunch of
stuff that cellphones couldn't do before
but it's still useful enough to carry
around with you all the time and you
know the same thing with computers and
Latino computers and laptops didn't
exist we would not be here we would not
be doing what we do today you know it's
huge impact for a lot of people and
smartwatches just don't have that you
know there isn't that thing that that
boy that they feel that everybody needs
even if they don't realize I need it
just yet so I think that's why that that
you know they haven't caught on too much
it's you know there's no reason to own
one other than to say that you have one
and as like an accessory I guess mm okay
well I'm expecting a very passionate
discussion among all of us people on
this particular topic cuz we've evolved
in we've all touched wearables or worn
wearables let's put it that way and we
all have you know our own opinions on it
I want us to get feisty right now to
talk about some wearables I'm gonna
disappoint you and completely agree with
Joe
on now it's hard to heart to outdo what
joe just said let's be honest that this
is me should really is now I back up
here I struggle with using the word
wearable when all we're talking about as
smart watches when I think wearable I'm
I'm thinking beyond the SmartWatch now
here's my biggest reason I have a really
nice watch already for starters but I
can't wear it day to day when I'm
sitting down at the computer that watch
it rubs on the desk it rubs on the
laptop I cannot use it and work at the
same time therefore a SmartWatch same
problem it just doesn't fit my needs so
what is a wearable to me it's it's
something else is a google glass well
I'm already wearing classes and I avoid
them whenever I can so I'd have to get
two pairs of google glass or or you know
that the transitional ones so that I can
wear my glasses or just my contacts and
is the things are getting difficult here
I for me I think actually one of the
better wearables out there is the
motorola moto hint just that earbud it
talks to you but it doesn't do anything
so for me wearables they're just like
Joe is saying they're they're very much
in each product they serve so little
that they really can't go mainstream
we've already got the computers we've
already got the cell phones we're
accomplishing everything we need these
guys it just for convenience now that
said I very much think of the business
place or students in school you're not
allowed to bring your cell phone out of
your pocket having those notifications
pop up on your wrist that's really cool
I definitely buy into that yeah you know
what is a good point um I I just imagine
what it would have been like back when I
was in college if I had let's say the
pebble I have on my wrist right now like
what it would be like if I was in class
you know maybe I might've been the only
person wearing and I would have made it
even cooler or nerdy i guess but i
believe the word you're looking for is
nerdy their jobs yeah nerdy exactly but
it would make be different in class you
know that my phone goes off and I'm just
like oh I don't even have to touch it
and people who what's that because I
when when uh smartwatches refers sort of
becoming a thing the pebble was
obviously one of the first ones to
pioneer the whole thing it uh you know a
lot of people it made people turn their
heads that's why I got little glimpses
of back in my days in san diego at
college like you know what do that been
like but anyway I digress I love the
point you brought up feisty about how
it's really semantics right like right
now we're seeing today we saw quite a
few articles come out about how Android
wear in particular has moved not really
a whole lot of units it's not
necessarily being adopted quite as fast
as say a smartphone has but when we talk
about smart watches that might be true
but honestly for me I I kind of live on
the other side of this topic in the
sense that i actually think wearables
have completely exploded because you got
to think about wearables in general
smartwatches yes might be a niche
product but I look at you know fitness
trackers and how everyone's wearing them
and whether or not they're actually
really beneficial for half the people
who are wearing them well that's a
different topic but it um I actually
think wearables are are the future they
are the next big thing whether or not
it's going to be smart watches in
general in particular I mean that may be
that that we still needs to be seen but
I think wearables are definitely
becoming a very mainstream thing you
just have to look at which portions of
the spectrum to look at as far as smart
watches go I mean I don't know I I
thought Android wear was a was a pretty
nice implementation to begin with I have
gone back to my pebble though because
well I mean I'm going to get into this
question next for me it's battery life
that really gets it gets me going on
Android where's that I wish I could keep
my watch on for much longer periods of
time and my pebble is the only thing
that allows me to do that especially for
certain functions that I need but before
I get into asking you guys what your
issues are with let's say smart watches
or Android wear in particular what what
smart watches are you guys rocking
anyway I know lon you said the Moto 360
um I on one side guys before we go any
further just a little quick fun fact for
those who are wondering android wear
moves 700,000 units in six months right
that was the new story yes it was I did
a little Google search
well you were rambling on there and
according to Peter Chao on october
twenty fifth two thousand eight the HTC
g1 sold about 600,000 units in its first
in his first year so to give everybody I
mean 700,000 in the first six months is
actually fairly decent for a brand new
platform considering that Android itself
actually didn't do that good fair enough
I did notice that you know everyone was
covering that particular article and
there was a mixture of positive reaction
and negative reaction I guess it depends
on how you look at it some people were
like oh they put out over 750,000 and
then other people were like but it
wasn't a million you know so i guess i'm
at cedia you see the wall street journal
article that everyone's all pissed off
about no i didn't get that one they
compared Android wear two iphones to
iphone sales Wow as if that were
something that could possibly be
compared I thought that was kind of
humorous a good job wall street journal
because that's what everybody thinks of
when I think android wear how many
iPhones were sold I well um back back to
the topic at hand um lon was talking
about the Moto 360 like that's the one
that you're rocking right yeah the moat
if if I do wear a SmartWatch the motor
360 is the one that I typically wear
because that's that's the one that
actually owns so but you know honestly
they're all really kind of the same so
it's like you wear one android wear
watch you kind of warm also they're
really not too different but I mean I
kind of agree with uh with you Josh on
what you said about wearables in general
they do I mean I do agree with the the
fitness like the fitness bands like I do
see a lot of people wearing fitness
bands so I agree in that in that regard
that they have taken it off but as far
as just like actual smartwatches I feel
like it's still very still very nice
because I don't see very many people
wearing them like right now I mean that
could change in the future obviously but
as of right now I think it's kind of
just the tech nerds that want to wear
and I think a lot of that has to do with
the fact that one there like a lot of
the watches are very they're very
masculine there
not like unisex so I think they were
like sort of like I like a more unisex
type watch I think the adoption rate
would probably a lot higher and then
they're not like the most fashionable
watches on the market like even like the
360 on the G watch are even though they
look really nice they still don't really
look as nice as something that is like a
normal watch like a Michael Kors or
something like that or a Nixon so all
right how about you over there Joe what
are you rocking on your wrist or what is
sitting on your table just wishing it
could be on your wrist um I have the the
LG G watch um and whether or not I where
it is based on and what I'm doing like
I'm just sitting here at the desk you
know writing or doing videos I'm not
wearing it because my cell phone is like
right there I can just pick it up but i
actually do wear it when I go out and
about doing things um like when I'm I
get a red light when I'm driving it's
easier to look you know the glance at my
wrist to see who sent me a message and
it is to pull my phone out of my pocket
look at it you know risk missing the
green light and having people honk at me
and stuff like that um but I mean most
of the time I'm actually I'm not wearing
it it's it's really only when I go out
and about and in situations we're taking
my phone out of my pocket is a bigger
inconvenience than it is to just look at
my wrist to see what's going on ok and
feisty who had a lot to say about
wearables do you which ones do you have
or which one are you using at this
moment the nothing i've had the LG G
watch it it's been a short time on my
wrist but at this moment there are no
wearables in the house ok so in the in
the limited amount of time that you have
the LG G watch feisty it really didn't
really commit didn't convince you about
about this ecosystem that we're seeing
hopefully growing the ecosystem yes i
love the ecosystem it's exactly what I
want and I want it embedded everywhere
want it in the steering wheel in my car
I wanted copia in the sleeve of my
jacket that sort of stuff but the wrist
watch again I just it does not fit my
life ok let's explore that we're
quick then let's stick with you if I see
you right now since I have you right now
so what is it about the wrist watch the
the wrist for the wrist watch form
factor the SmartWatch that doesn't
convince you that it's something that
you would want to have in your
repertoire it really comes down to the
functionality for me when I'm in a
position where I'm wearing the short
sleeves I'm usually just sitting in the
office you're you know plunkett away on
the laptop again it rubs on the desk it
rubs on the laptop it wrecks things Rex
the watch and it's uncomfortable can't
wear it the rest of the time of dressing
up nice it's going under my you know
shirt jacket and it's under the
cufflinks and again it's a piece of
jewelry at that point but it serves zero
function other than aesthetics so for me
the big thing you know moving in what's
the ideal wearable in this case it again
come down to the functionality you
munchin battery life and I think we're
in this situation right now where
there's no one watch or even fitness
tracker that offers everything that
somebody wants I'd like a watch that has
theoretically a watch it like a wearable
that has its own data connection it's
got GPS at a heart rate sensor and you
know / do some nice sleep monitoring so
the Samsung does busy maybe yeah the
gear s yes but I'd also like Android
wear yeah okay so like you said you
opened up asking about the ecosystem yes
absolutely love the ecosystem just
wristwatch can't do it yeah it does feel
like Android wear is sort of the jumping
off point to what so many other form
factors could be I mean obviously we're
looking at android auto it takes a few
cues from Android wear so yeah the
ecosystem probably will move forward
where the actual form factor of the
wristwatch kind of doesn't Joe what are
some of the problems that you see with
the the SmartWatch game let's say you
know you have the g watch I almost at
heart the LG G wife for example um
that's a really difficult question
because I don't know exactly where these
things are are going and that might
be the problem at least to me because I
don't know what the purpose of these are
going to eventually become uh I'm sorry
I'm trying to like think of like a
better way to phrase that I really can't
but you like it like I said earlier you
know with smartphones and like last you
know all these other technologies its
mainstream we know what it's for and we
know why it's here but you know like
with the watch I don't know why I have
this thing on my wrist right now or well
it's on my table right now but I don't
know why I have it and I would really
like to have a reason to own it so I
think that's its biggest weakness right
now is just you know not enough reasons
to have one okay let's jump over to lon
uh yeah kind of have to just piggyback
off what a feisty said like it's that I
think one of the biggest problems is
that they don't operate they don't
function without your phone and I think
that's the reason I think it's kind of
one of the biggest drawbacks is that you
can't it doesn't it's almost it's just a
watch at that point if you don't have
your phone with you and I know like with
the update and then some the Sony
SmartWatch 3 having gps it can function
somewhat without your phone like you can
go running and then when you come back
to your phone it'll sink the data up but
you can't you know make phone calls you
can't answer you know text messages or
anything without the phone and I think
that's sort of like you know it's not
really it's not really saving you too
many steps I mean it's not really any
more difficult to just pull your phone
out of your pocket and just answer that
text on your phone I mean yeah you can
kind of you can just look at it and see
if it's a prior if it's important and
decide whether you want to answer or not
but i don't know i just don't really see
that it's saving you all that much time
to just take your phone out of your
pocket look at it and decide whether you
want to answer it or not so i think
that's one of the biggest problems well
you're bringing a bug you bring up a
particular point that it's you said the
phrase it's just a watch at that point
and what if what if you looked at it
from that scope what if you looked at it
as I want a new watch maybe I would go
for this electronic watch that has a
little bit more to it than a regular
wristwatch that will just tick is it
wrong
to think that smartwatches could just be
a fashion item like feisty said or that
maybe the functionality will will will
not quite evolved maybe we'll just be a
fashion statement is it wrong to think
that that could be where this goes I
don't think I don't think that's
necessarily like the wrong way to to
look at it but I don't know I just feel
like if you're going to buy a SmartWatch
you kind of want to use it for the smart
functionalities and not just as a watch
and if you want to use as a watch you
want the battery life to be you know
reasonable not just like a couple days
if you're just going to use as a watch
so I don't know I guess that's my way of
looking at it okay but before before
smartwatches became a thing I have this
questions for all you guys did you guys
have a collection of watches or did you
have like you know a favorite watch that
you are before this whole SmartWatch
revolution sort of took off when I took
off but came about I'll go first cuz my
answer is quick I have never wondered
watch in my lifetime so what Android
wear why though that's that that's the
part that I want to see because maybe
maybe we're exploring you know maybe
it's not just smart watches or Android
wear that's the problem maybe maybe what
they're doing is they're trying to jump
into and jump into a system that not
everyone has adopted in the first place
and you might be an example what why
don't I come you never really were a
watch person um uh it's just I don't
know that's a difficult question to
answer it's just something I wasn't into
you like why don't you wear bracelets
why don't you wear jewelry you know how
come you don't wear Crocs you know it's
just it just wasn't my bag no it's just
something that I was ever into and you
know I mean I got the the G watch
because I'm a tech nerd and I work for a
tech blog and you know it was uh said to
me at one point that it'd behoove me to
pick one up so I you know I mean it's it
I don't know I just is something I was
never really into before and it's not
really i'm into now like i don't really
you know look at this thing like man my
left wrist looks way more badass than my
right with this awesome things like it
frankly it reminds me of those casio
calculator watches from like the 80s and
90s you guys remember those yeah yeah
yeah yeah that's kind of what it reminds
me of like it's and I think it's the
same kind of people who wear both kinds
of watches you know nerds yeah i mean i
don't see like i don't see you know the
you know the cheerleader homecoming
queen like rocking and a moto 360
oh my god i went homecoming queen i'm
gonna totally blog this on google+ on my
watch like that's not gonna happen like
if you could blog on your watch like we
were done like that's all we need like
honestly like you brought that up and I
thought about I was like holy that
would be really cool we would have no
like videos at mwc you would see all you
see you guys walking around behind a
bunch of other people's videos just
talking to your wrist you never know
maybe five years we're gonna see that
happen man that'd be great in home
automation while we're at it I would
love home automation on Android wear oh
yeah that would be really good so talk
to my watch sip thermostat so not so not
really much of a watch person see this
is something that I said one time like
me like like right when Android wear was
kind of starting to become a thing there
aren't that many people who wear watches
in general I think what I think it's not
I think it's fair to say that we're kind
of 50-50 split when I cut it like at
least in the West that you know you can
walk around and you're not going to see
every single person wearing a watch so
maybe this isn't the form factor that
the SmartWatch revolution needs to sort
of focus on maybe how about you feisty
were there any watches that you had you
have do you have a watch collection at
all I imagine you have you have a very
stylish profile picture here on skype so
I feel like you have one of those wooden
boxes with like a valve in the middle
always watches in it she's got the watch
pillows inside yeah exactly I'm not
gonna say I dressed up for that picture
uh I used to have a lot of watches now
that was before before I took my first
office job I was out there as you know
outdoor jobs my hands were dirty it was
during those times where a wash was
invaluable I couldn't take my phone out
of my pocket indeed this goes back to a
time when I didn't have a phone in my
pocket it just
wasn't feasible oh and during that time
I mean your hands are dirty you can't
reach in your pocket you don't even want
to walk touch the watch because you're
covered in oil you're covered in food
whatever the case may be and I'm sure
there's a lot of people out there right
now that are in this boat also so just
to be able to glance at the watch yes to
answer your question I had a number of
them I took the office job I keep you
know I kept one very nice watch and
everything else was either given away or
was worn out anyways and hit the trash
can I mean I've got recycled okay every
every single person who wears watches
they're either a metal band or a leather
band and I'm gonna take a bet and say
that you're a leather band kind of guy
you would lose I'm sorry metal band are
you serious metal band really it'll band
feisty is like hemp so one Josh wearing
a hemp watch or a hemp watch band before
anybody else in this pot okay before we
even get into any of that right now with
your qwerty with your hardware qwerty
keyboard in your hemp wristwatch hahaha
gotta go back in time right now I I want
to rock those those those silicon but
clear clear silicone bands man those are
gross don't they make like kids sandals
made out of that yeah exactly oh man
when I was a kid I had a watch that had
a clear band and I thought it was the
coolest thing but for me um ok so i
guess this would allow me to answer the
question two is I I do look at watches
as a fashion statement if you look at
earlier videos of android authority that
I was doing um he would notice that I
had a lot of stuff on my wrists I had a
watch on my left hand and then on my
right hand I would have a bunch of like
bracelets and trinkets from people that
mattered to me you know I I used to say
I only wear things that really mean
something to me so I would have like
beads I would have liked this necklace
from Ghana that my best friend got me
and I just wrap it around my wrist I
since then have stopped wearing that
stuff add much to the chagrin of my best
friend but our our big boss Darcy was
super happy about that because you said
it distracted from the phone
but anyway um but in any case oh yeah I
do look at them as a fashion statement
and as far as the question goes of what
kind of band i would use as long as it
matches my shoes and my belt let's put
it that way I have I mean that I mean
that that category of fashion sense I
should say but yeah I do look at the
Miss fashion statements and I and
whether or not they're smart or not it
doesn't matter as long as they look good
and if they happen to be smart I want
the function to to to add to what i need
to do but we have we have lon left did
you have a watch collection before
smartwatches became a thing yeah I was
actually kind of big into watches for a
little bit but my watch collection
consists mostly of like g shocks and
stuff so but I was pretty big nough g
shocks for a while and but i'm kind of
the same way as you are like I just kind
of warm I didn't really wear them to
tell time I just warm because I like the
way they they looked so they're just a a
part of my wardrobe I just warm as like
a fashion statement and not really not
really anything else but yeah my
collection is pretty small I kind of
like kind of got out of collecting
watches because I don't know it was just
I guess it was just a phase of mine I
guess but so my collection is pretty
small ok so you know with this with this
whole idea in mind we all have differing
opinions on even just the watch the idea
of the watch in general the the question
I wanted to post everybody with that in
mind that you know we've all had varying
degrees of liking watches and Joe's case
you never really did like learning them
never really has four lon and I wear
fashion statements and for Jonathan the
same but then you know he moved on to a
different part of his life so you didn't
need it as much I guess do you think
that the smart device the wearable needs
to move beyond the watch and go
somewhere else and if so what kind of
device do you think that would look like
have you ever seen the television show
continuum is a newer show it's a little
bit crazy the main character is a cop
that was sent back from the future and
you know she's got basically the entire
phone and every
a full computer system and right in her
head this is going a little bit extreme
here but its built-in it's a biometric
thing it's you she doesn't have to think
about it she doesn't have to charge it
she just you know wakes up in the
morning and watches the video in her
head so to speak and maybe that's
extreme and and certainly going into you
physically embedding technology gets it
gets scary however the idea of having
limitless power for starters and having
it always available is that's kind of
exciting to me I think I would pursue
something like this limitless power
that's an awesome phrase to use for that
how about Joe like dessert is there a
wearable that you would actually wear um
that's a good question I always wanted
to try google glass I think that's kind
of like a fun concept but I mean much
like the you know much like Android
whether you can't really do much with it
just yet but um I always thought that
the next thing was going to come from
something that was directly in front of
your face because you literally cannot
use any less effort to check something
then when something is already there in
front of your face all the time um so I
mean I always wanted something like a
you know a HUD you know just like a
heads-up display that you're knocking
like access and you used without
actually having to do anything so you
want life to look like a video game
because I way damn damn trade who
wouldn't man that's all so you have all
the information right there you got like
all your vital stats and you know your
inventory because I have like what's in
your wallet over there also you know who
wouldn't want a heads-up display I think
that's really awesome that's what I want
did you guys ever play Metroid Prime you
know how I i stopped at super i stopped
at super metroid okay metroid prime was
like the first first person shooter
version of metroid and it and when you
were talking about like heads-up
displays I thought of that because when
she puts on the helmet like the heads-up
display it was one of the first ones
like to look like it actually moved with
the person rather than just a static
thing um but yeah okay so something a
little bit more closer to the face I
suppose how about how about you lon you
know coming from somebody who
was a watch enthusiasts are you happy
with the watch form factor or is there a
is the reform factor that you think the
smart device needs to move into in order
to become relevant yeah I have to have
to agree with Joe like I would want
something like I would want like a
contact lens that like I could put into
my eye and I could like see everything
like information like whether I could
lock on it somebody and like identify
them it's either weight height and name
and all that stuff like lock onto
somebody I'd really be cool or something
that makes me probably like a heads up
display like Iron Man or something like
just in my eye because I mean if it's in
my high I regret contacts anyway so if I
like a smart contact I think that'd be
pretty sweet to just be able to see
information and not have to do anything
because I mean with a SmartWatch you
still have to check it and if it's
already like in my I can just I ricci it
how would you control something like
that though that's that's what I'm
wondering it's just biometrically like
how I can continuum like is it leave it
to feisty for me to say what kind of
wearable DeWine he goes implant I wanted
inside of me um the I salt I can't
remember where I saw this at but a
really fun concept for controlling that
kind of stuff like like something like a
wristband not like a watch but like a
little band and you could like like tap
your palm with your fingers or something
and like swype things and move them away
I thought that was a pretty cool concept
but I i wish i can remember i saw that
from but that i would be my idea of how
to control it well we can't have we
can't have an episode of the friday tube
a podcast without this brush II told me
to make sure to add this in he would I
think he would want a wearable with a
Taser on it and so I think it just needs
to have a Taser I think he's good so
he's wrong it'd be like it'd be like
Cyclops the next men yeah press the
button it shoots things but is it taser
he's got to get like super close to the
this guy bash his head on them yeah
exactly
so if if Android wear is supposedly not
really on its way up so far one thing
that we're seeing and we're definitely
going to get confirmation of this in mwc
at least lon and I are going to we all
are really but lon and I might be able
to actually see these things in the
flesh HTC obviously Apple is going to
have its own wearable that is based upon
their own operating system but it also
looks like these manufacturers who are
in the Android cut are deciding not to
go android wear now do you guys think
that that's actually a good move do you
think that moving into a different
operating system at least for someone
like HTC or LG with their webos wearable
is that enough to to sort of change it
up is it is it too little too late
already have we proven that the wearable
is not something or the why the
SmartWatch is not something that's going
to catch on even if they change it to
say Tizen or webos what do you guys
think about what are you could you guys
think about the operating system the
very core of a SmartWatch being changed
anybody else want to go first because I
don't know you mean just as far as like
you mean just as far as like Android o
m0 like yeah yeah I mean obviously we
might get into the Apple watch for a
little bit but you know obviously being
an Android podcast it's going to be
interesting seeing how some of these
manufacturers are actually going away
from Android and it begs the question is
that is that going to be effective I
don't I don't think it's necessarily a
bad move because as I think as long as
they make the watch compatible like a
cross you know multiple multitude of
Android devices and not just their own
specifically then I don't think it's a
too bad of a move especially since
android where I mean it hasn't exactly i
wouldn't say it's exactly exploded onto
the scene so at this point in time right
now I don't think it's I think it's okay
for them to try a different operating
system and just sort of see how it goes
okay I I remember missing with a Tizen
device with the
Oh Samsung gear it was a I don't know
Android we're definitely seemed like
that leap forward that that SmartWatch
is needed for sure but it's it remains
to be seen whether or not Tizen will
grow into what Android wear has already
become it's just interesting let's uh
Joe did you have any thoughts on it I
know I kind of blessed that on to you
guys I've nowhere yeah I I needed a
minute to think about it cuz sometimes
you know I have like an immediate answer
but every now and again I need a couple
of minutes to uh to articulate it the
way I look at you know like HTC by the
way lon according to one of our talented
writers Rob triggs the HTC SmartWatch
will play nice with all phones running
android 4.4 and later and apple products
running iOS 7 and later so yes that is
it's not going to be HTC only yeah um
that's a good move but the way I look at
you know like um HTC branching off
samsung branching off and even like the
pebble smartwatch to a degree is the
same way i look at om skins on my I
guess not really skins but you know om
skins on Android in that you know it
allows you know it allows the you know
the OEMs to branch out a little bit and
try some new things and you know I mean
you better believe that you know if HTC
smart watches some has something really
really cool or really special about it
eventually a similar thing will be
integrated into android wear I mean
that's how Android has been growing for
years now is you know that you know
other hackers or mod rommerz rom modders
something or you know oam scans in
southern you know they push the
boundaries in one direction and then at
some point Google's like hey you know
what that's not a bad feature will
incorporate that like a one really good
example is the drop-down notifications
or the I'm sorry the the quick settings
which started out in a samsung OEM skin
and before that a rom that you can find
on next day somewhere so you know I
think it's gonna be the same kind of
thing with wearables where you know I
think it's great that they're branching
out more to try new things and to try to
implement more features because i think
you know ultimately competition for
those features will eventually be
integrated back into android wear the
US making the platform stronger so
really I mean it's a win-win for
everybody there's some extras choices
out there for everyone if they want to
go those routes or they can just wait
for Android wear to evolve to kind of
swallow up the competition like android
does so I mean I'm cool with it either
way okay feisty we lost you there for a
second but just to bring you back into
it we were talking about whether these
OEMs who for the most part our part of
androids camp the creating wearables or
smart watches that are using different
operating systems now obviously their
compatibility with smartphones might be
might vary from time to time but it
looks like at least one joe said HTC
will play with everything with everybody
really um but is it a good move to go
away from what is you know this large
ecosystem that you said you're actually
happy to have and create smart watches
with say Tizen web OS which I remember a
couple the other ones obviously the
Apple watch is going to be something we
touch upon a little bit how do you feel
about these OEMs going outside of the
Android wear route I've really truly
mixed feelings on this I hope I don't
duplicate anything lon had said I think
it's great that they're reaching out you
know doing their own thing creating
their own s.o.s their own ecosystem and
and like Joe was saying it in the end
it's all going to come around together
and and if somebody's going to step up
and take all of the feature all of the
best features of all of these OSS and
and you know really bring it together
but I think right now it's that you know
it's that separation that's so in a way
of holding wearables back we're saying
that wearables are and you know for the
niche you know they just not too many
people can use them because they're not
you know solid enough for mainstream and
with everybody go on their own route I
just I keep seeing these different you
know these separate roads and
lost my train of thought here let's go
back to laptops again not laptops are
just computers in general right for the
longest time Microsoft you know that
came and they ultimately they swept the
market and everybody ran Microsoft and
that computers became their own and now
they've split off and you know the you
bunt to the Linux community is growing
the the mac OSX community it's growing
these these other systems are coming
around to fill in the gaps at and as in
you know niche extras but we had one
coherent I just called Microsoft Windows
coherent anyways we had one coherence or
everything right so right now we don't
have that one standard of an OS I might
like personally you know Android wear
but is it the answer I don't think so i
think if it was HTC wouldn't be thinking
of their own samsung may still be trying
to push ties in their their own way to
go but again if there was that dominant
OS that really served the people the way
we needed it there would be no room for
these outcrops no need for them at this
time not until wearables are more
mainstream so do you think it's a bad
sign that they're they're sort of
branching off and trying to make their
own operating systems for these smart
watches is that bad sign for Android
where i should say no i don't think so
and you have our loyalists let's look at
android specifically i don't see
cyanogenmod taking over android you know
despite their claims and yes they have
more users now but CM and even with cm12
coming out it's a lot of people excited
but it's not going to take over
mainstream android still going to exist
and i think that's going to be the same
with android wear no matter how much
competition comes along even with apple
i think android wear will remain because
it ties to the google system
you know Google now specifically is a
very powerful we don't know it in our
day-to-day lives sometimes but but
Google now kind of pulls it all together
ok we have mentioned Apple a few times
now and I want to open the floor for our
last let's say 10 to 15 minutes here on
the podcast while we will talk about our
thoughts on the Apple watch obviously
none of us have actually seen it in the
flesh or even worn it yes that's months
and months maybe even a year off still
how do you guys feel about the Apple
watch because I've heard from a lot of
people this is exactly what we should
have had in a SmartWatch in the
beginning which i think is a ridiculous
claim but if if it's not all this
cracked up to be what is it that a
SmartWatch can have that would actually
make you want to buy it let's start off
with lon do you have one for us um what
do you think what do you think of the
Apple watch yeah let's start with that
when I first it of aesthetically I don't
like the way that it looks because I
prefer you know just I want a watch
that's round like you know a normal
watch would be so aesthetically I don't
think it's that great looking but I do
think that Apple is getting a lot of
things right as far as making making it
appeal to the masses and and both male
and female because they have the small
one and the larger one and you don't
really get that with Android wear like
so they're certain they've gotten that
aspect right where they're appealing to
you know either sex and also the way
that they are handling the the band
support and how easy how easy it is to
swap out the bands because a lot of
these other Android wear watches you
know it's you have to use the tool and
to get the little spring out but with
the apple the Apple watch you can just
slide them out slide out the bands and
there's going to be like since its Apple
you know there's going to be like a ton
of them to pick from so I think they
have like the customization down to
which people are going to like a lot I
mean the price is probably going to you
know be through the roof though so I
don't know it's I think that
the prices are probably going to kind of
lose out on maybe but I guess it depends
really on how they're going to handle it
but I don't know so I think they're
doing some things right and then they're
doing some things are a little bit
questionable so it's kind of hard to say
right now but since it's not physically
out but that's sort of how I feel about
it right now hmm okay I could hear some
pitchforks being drawn up earlier when
you are saying that they were doing some
stuff right so is that is that what it
would be safe to say that that's
something what you are mentioning about
the Apple watch that it's highly
customizable in an easy way would it be
safe to say that that's something you
would want out of a you know your dream
wearable what would your dream wearable
look like that uh as you mean like as
like a as a watch form factor yeah let's
talk about a SmartWatch since that's our
focus um I don't know I think I'd want
to look like I'd want to look like a
really luxurious watch like like a Nixon
or something uh like so I would want to
be all metal but then I want to be able
to easily like swap out the bands and
stuff and maybe like put in anything on
my own so I don't wanna have to deal
with to know those little spring
whatever they're called but just I want
to watch it is highly customizable and
one that actually will do things that I
want to do like I would like to like I
mentioned earlier I want to be able to
text for my watch and not have to talk
into it in order to send out a message I
want to actually be able to physically
type on it but I don't know I just want
something that looks nice sometimes
looks nicer than the ones we have right
now okay yeah I I'll just answer real
quickly on the Apple watch part I
actually think it looks ridiculous I
really do not i am not a fan of the way
it looks at all the huge dial on the
side it's going to be just the bubbly
iOS icons all over the place it's why I
gonna make some ridiculous noises and
yeah I've been hearing from certain
people like I watch a lot of youtubers
and they won the Apple watch was
announced they said you know this is
exactly what all these smart watches
were supposed to be apples going to get
a ride
kept looking at it like I don't think
they are like let this doesn't look good
at all to be um obviously functionality
is something we're gonna figure out
later on but let's pop over to Joe if
you had any thoughts about the Apple
watch you can go ahead and sound them
off but what does but also after that
what is what does a dream wearable look
like for you what would make you a watch
guy thank you for asking both questions
at once because i have almost nothing to
say about the Apple watch the only thing
I will say is it um in general like the
you know the mass media at least in the
United States I can't speak for the rest
of the world I don't know their habits
but in the United States you know if
somebody at apple headquarters farts
you're going to see 90 headlines about
it so I think in terms of like exposure
to the mainstream I think apple the
Apple watch is going to do a lot more
than Android wear has in making people
aware that wearable technology exists in
a consumer you know format and that's
really all I can say about it cuz I
haven't seen it I think I mean I think
it's hideous also but I actually do like
the dial on the side at least if I can
use that to control apps and stuff I
guess so but only if it's functional
like if it's just kind of like there and
you're like oh yeah spin for screen
brightness I hate it um but uh then you
ever see you you would have those people
who are so into the apple watch going
look at the screen go up and down like
Christmas I remember when the ipad came
out with that smart cover and it would
snap onto the sign it was like hear the
snap off it drove me nuts i will when
the Nintendo 3ds came out I I went
through all that with my friends you
like oh look at the 3d slider turn it on
and off you know and like oh my head
goes from hurting to not hurting this is
great what a great game system you have
there that's what i though but for me
like to forbid for me to be of 24 7
SmartWatch where um I would want it's
it's all software for me at this point I
mean like I don't really you know I
don't think I'm ever gonna wear watch as
a fashion statement I just you know it's
never been something that I've ever done
I don't think it's cuz I never do but i
will put anything you know on my wrist
if it helps me throughout
the day earlier I mentioned home
automation you know being able to you
know integrate this with nest my biggest
beef with Android wear is the navigation
like getting to my applications using my
applications you know it's takes a home
to this here one tap to tap three tap
because the first tap didn't register um
and then swipe down swipe down so I Paul
the way the bottom start and now I met
my apps and then I can open an app and
actually do something I mean that took
like you know 56 seconds and that's just
ridiculous for something that should be
a lot faster than that so I mean the
only thing I really want in in this in
the wearable platform is something
that's easier to use something that's
less clunky and a little bit more
ergonomic and then something that also
does things other than let me check my
notifications or look at the weather
real quick okay yeah you're absolutely
right about the navigation part because
if you were in a car right now speeding
up to a red light you'd probably be dead
right now after all that yeah exactly it
and oh I mean I'd probably be dead
anyway because I had to take both my
hands off the wheel to use the damn
thing that me mr. like I can like rotate
my wrist 180 degrees and then an extra
90 degrees to tap it with the same hand
oh my goodness how creepy would that
look what head turning you're like the
same wrist that the watch is on like
turning your hand 180 degrees to tap it
with the same hand that the Moga of the
wrist oh goodness we get implants from
feisty and now we have like quadruple or
what infinite jointed risks or something
oh if I saw one person do that I'd
probably enter my house and never leave
again yeah no that's it it was Cylons
are taking over we're done silence your
that me more they have he has he's in
bed and he has the the blanket up to his
face like I'm not leaving nope and for
our final word let's jump over to feisty
if you have thoughts on the Apple watch
because we mentioned it so much I want
to make sure we at least say a couple
things about it go for it but also what
would a dream wearable look like for you
certainly the Apple watch I remember
seeing the first renders of it and that
you know that OS
just those little bubbles all over the
place I could not help but laugh I
honestly laughed at it thank you that's
exactly my reaction if they had called
it bubble wrap OS and if the bubbles
popped when you tap them without having
this conversation right now would be the
greatest thing of all time did you guys
play that game back in the day the
bubble wrap game on on Android oh yeah
oh my god yes yeah yeah yeah I go if I
see uh you know for all the hate we give
to this watch it's going to sell just
the my opinion the nature of the Apple
you know just that the fans that are out
there this device is gonna sell it's
going to take credit for bringing
watches into the mainstream I hate that
but I think that's what's gonna happen
yeah I do agree it will sell but I don't
think it's going to be on the scale of
like how like the iPhone exploded when
it came out in 2007 I'll think it's
gonna be like on that type of scale but
I do believe it will sell absolutely so
go to my ideal wearable exactly what the
other guys said hear it it needs to
serve all of the purposes so instead of
being a notification tool it needs to be
a full OS needs to be your SmartWatch so
to speak on your wrist but for me it
needs to operate via voice and by touch
with the same skill set with the same
abilities and then as well it needs to
give audio feedback as well as a visual
feedback that's easy to work with
without obstructing the rest of your
daily life you know obviously that's the
definition of the perfect wearable I
guess what I'm saying is for me the
wristwatch certainly can't do it and
can't do it alone it would be a part of
you know if I had the again I guess what
I'm saying is is smart watch on the arm
the moto hint kind of thing earbud in
the ear and then a google glass on the
face yes google glasses some audio but
the cuckoo I someone a little bit more
no but I don't like I think if I wanted
google glass I'd have it by now it's
just it's too obstructive it doesn't
give enough visual feedback you know for
its form factor hmm there's too much
restriction on it as well I mean I don't
want to be held by the FBI I know
Limited case here but held by the FBI
because I wore my classes to the movie
theater yeah yeah and that's going to be
that's a whole different topic is the
the whole idea of creating this new
culture that has to meld in with the
mainstream like when you were talking
about the hint and then putting the
swirl watch on and then the google glass
in the face um i get this image if you
remember the old batman movies i just
imagine feisty like putting on all of
the things one by one oh yes my
SmartWatch is a project RL watch I can
swap it out and put crushes taser on it
and my io output so I can attach to the
stereo which brings up a great point all
of my weary ol my wearables my ideal
solution is completely wireless I can't
afford to have wires all over the place
mmm and then of course power becomes an
issue but yeah always that always has
been okay great well i mean if i had to
put out my ideas on what a dream
wearable would be you guys yeah i mean
feisty in particular reach for the stars
there i didn't even think about all that
i was just thinking of what we have
right now what kind of style I would
want I would want the best of both
worlds i still want the chronograph in
terms of i want the real ticking turning
gears but then if you have the watch
face behind the arms that are doing the
hour in the minute in the second if you
were to hit a button to look at the
actual interface of the OS those those
hands would go translucent and it would
just become a screen that's what i
thought at least um the only haven't
seen the kairos SmartWatch i have not
quite where i was thinking but it is
somewhere in that in that vicinity the
Martian SmartWatch also had a little bit
of that but it's just got that tiny LED
screen on the bottom
yeah but yeah I mean that was the one
that I thought of but the last one that
I was thinking of was I said this I
remember back at Aoife I want to slap
and I want to slap then watch that has a
screen I waiting for it and the waiting
for this whole podcast for you to say so
I want this extremely hipster thing
every episode like clockwork man I know
I always got to end it on that like to
be amazing and then you just like it
don't be like a tall screen on it and
you will just see you would turn on you
would just put it right onto your wrist
I think that'd be amazing it easy and it
blends in because it's not like you know
trying too hard to be a certain way okay
fine I'm not I'm not gonna get too much
farther into this for bless Joe makes
fun of me all right well we have talked
