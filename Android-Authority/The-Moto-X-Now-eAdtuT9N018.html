backing of google dropped a bit of a
bombshell on the android space a phone
that was smaller than the common 5-inch
screen device and offered a few really
practical and very useful new features
and on top of all of that complete
customization and even more on top of
that it was all made in the USA now if
one thing was becoming certain it was
that Motorola was making a comeback and
their trajectory looked really good
especially with this flagship leading
the movement but that was them and it's
Josh regard from Android thorny what's
going on everybody and this is the Moto
X now now we will get into the news that
happened earlier this week but first
this is a video that is supposed to
focus on the device and that is exactly
what I'm going to do for now now to say
that I was excited about the Moto X when
it first came out and everything that it
offered is really an understatement
after all this Moto X right here is the
first film that actually made me happy
to sign a two-year contract because I
was going to get what was to become one
of my favorite phones of the year now
coming back to the wood backing that was
supposed to come when the Moto X was
first released that's just another
example or one of the examples rather of
Motorola's troubles ever since this
phone came out only recently did the
wood backs finally come into the fray
and at first they came in at $100 as a
premium price point luckily those have
gone down but by now I'm actually just
really happy with this one and while I
might customize a Moto X in the future
it's not something that I'm looking to
do for a while taking a look at this
device it is still really holding up and
even if I throw it around a little bit
all I get is very minimal wear and tear
for the most part I've had no problems
whatsoever the Moto X did make the case
that phones didn't have to be big or
even super powerful to be enjoyable and
in terms of the size you do have a very
very easy phone to handle in basically
one hand which is something that most
other phones can't save and that curve
on the back definitely helps as well the
720p smaller screen actually never gave
me any display Envy and I'm still able
to enjoy whatever I'm doing
no matter what it is as far as
performance goes it remains about as
good as it was when I first got this
phone and I love that the Moto X
continues to prove that super new
processors are not necessarily required
for a good experience now how about the
main features of the Moto X I have
brought to the Android space well I do
use them still all the time especially
the voice commands by saying ok Google
now this is still really one of my
favorite options out there for
hands-free multitasking and it just
works really well and is one of the best
parts about the phone now as you can see
right there we also have active display
and that active display still stands
alone in the Android space as one of the
best ways of getting your notifications
that is already built into the phone but
as much as I do love the active display
I have to admit I don't use it quite as
much but that is for one very particular
and specific reason which brings me to
one of the reasons why I still really
love my Moto X now with Motorola having
the backing of Google when this phone
first came out it definitely was a nexus
like experience that wasn't completely
stock but definitely looks like it and
had only a few features that Motorola
baked in themselves I've used a v8 on
here everything home launcher I've done
a lot to change the experience on this
phone but the underlying features that
really make the Moto X differentiate
itself from the rest of the pack were
still there and that's something that I
think the Moto X provides any Android
user the full customization that Android
gives you without the need for really
losing some of the features that make it
what it is but then what made the Moto X
so appealing was just how much it was
being supported by Google for example
KitKat didn't take very long to come to
the phone at all and it only made the
experience better by keeping the phone
as current as possible but then that's
what makes this week's piece of news
incredibly important and to be honest
very unsettling because Google in an
incredible move sold Motorola to Lenovo
for 2.9 1 billion dollars and
essentially what this means is that
lenovo has motorola and Woggle kept many
parts of Motorola
for the most part it's up to Lenovo now
to see what to do with the future of
Motorola
far as the reasons why something like
this happened well there's a lot of
speculation motorola to be fair have
been a tough cookie to crack financially
despite good intentions and good if not
initially rocky implementation and a
rekindled respect among the industry and
consumers alike the return on glucose
investment just didn't really come fast
enough now one can argue that Google got
a lot of patents from Motorola and
that's probably the value that they
really put into this acquisition but
ultimately selling the company for such
a low price to Lenovo is really a big
benefit to Lenovo so now one of the
world's top leaders in computing now has
one of the most recognizable names in
mobile now what would that mean for
those of you who own moto x's or have
been following Motorola for the last
number of months and we're really
excited about where it was going to go
well that's the part that's what
suddenly it's because we don't really
know the skeptics will point to the fact
that Lenovo has its own mobile division
and its own sort of image of what a
mobile platform should look like and
that might be the main detractor for
them essentially that means goodbye
stock like Android experience
goodbye timely updates and essentially
goodbye motorola as we know it today but
those who know Lenovo's track record of
revitalizing old names in tech like the
IBM ThinkPad may find some positive
vibes me I'm kind of in the middle
because while I do like what Lenovo does
I'm a fan of theirs and I'm kind of
excited to see where they will go with
Motorola one of the biggest hopes that I
have for them is that Lenovo will let
Motorola still be essentially what we
know Motorola to be and just cultivate
it from a behind-the-scenes perspective
I do have to say that that positivity is
greatly outweighed by the fact that
losing Google as a parent company is a
huge - in the end I can only hope that
the foundation set in place by Motorola
when they were with Google will be
appealing enough for Lenovo to continue
to cultivate for anybody that asks me
what kind of Android device should I get
the Moto X still remains and near the
top primarily because it is a great
entry point into the Android space that
is
very appreciated by even Android
veterans we don't know what the new
Lenovo driven Motorola devices will look
like in the future
but until then you can still enjoy the
one that Google helped make a reality so
as always thank you guys very much for
watching and I hope you enjoyed this
look at the Moto X now especially
considering the big piece of news that
happened just a couple days ago I still
think the Moto X is a a great device and
since it is still available in the
iteration that it is in right now a lot
of users out there will still have a
good time with it
even if in the future we don't know
where devices like the Moto X might go
