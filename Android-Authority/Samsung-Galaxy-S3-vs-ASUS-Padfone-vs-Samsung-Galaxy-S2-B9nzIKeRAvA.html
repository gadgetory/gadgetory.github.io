decided we we got an s3 here in Taiwan
we're just comparing with asus padfone
and we're looking at the original
best-selling android phone to 2011 which
is the galaxy s2 obviously the galaxy s2
is the slowest of the bunch we have a
Snapdragon s4 1.5 gigahertz dual-core in
the PadFone which makes it lte-capable
and then we have the international
variant which is the quad core 1.4
gigahertz on the 4th woven 8 inch HD
super amoled samsung galaxy s3 now
performance wise this one is the most
powerful of the bunch but the PadFone
has the special the special ability to
actually power a full tablet computers
we have here which really makes it in
the field of its own in terms of how
they feel in the hand comparing the the
s3 and the PadFone i mean once you had a
taste of the s3 it's really hard to go
back to anything smaller even pulling
out my s2 it actually feels kind of
embarrassing it's just not enough phone
it's a four point eight inch screen you
know with a nice curved bezel it really
fits nicely in the hand but I have to
say that the PadFone feels really great
too and so for those seeking maybe a
little smaller of a form factor with
more flexibility down the road the
PadFone is going to be the one to get
otherwise probably the samsung galaxy s3
would be the better of the two but just
for the utility that the PadFone has
because you can attach it to a dock it
puts it in a field of its own I mean the
galaxy s3 retails for around seven
hundred dollars unlocked and you can get
a tablet a docking station and a
smartphone for around nine hundred so
you're getting a lot more bang for buck
both contain an eight megapixel camera
on the rear arguably going to take
comparable photos this has asus is
custom overlay but Samsung has really
done a nice job with there's two really
really minimal but yeah
so everyone we're just comparing the
samsung galaxy s3 vs. Asus Padfone
versus last year's best selling Android
phone the samsung galaxy s2 my name is
Darcy like ooh babe we're here at
computex live with android authority</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
