brought to you by Atlassian build what's
next we're hearing rumors that the
Samsung Galaxy Note 6 will launch early
like July the latest rumor out of South
Korea is that the king of phablets will
not only launch early in July but will
have Android and on board to boot while
reports and rumors on the galaxy note 6
are somewhat all over the place based on
the s7 s Hardware it's safe to assume
that we'll see microSD card support on
the note 6 it's also quite likely that
we'll see USB type-c supported it's less
likely that the phone will be
water-resistant given that the note 4
wasn't but the s5 was according to the
International Business Times the
upcoming phone will feature a massive
5.8 inch screen with qHD display that's
2560 by 1440 rumours also suggest that
Samsung might be doing away with the
diamond pixels and instead opt for a
slimmer RGB matrix AMOLED panel
continued talk of pressure sensitive
continue to float around though by the
same account the s7 was alleged to
support that as well and of course it
doesn't powering the device is said to
be either a Samsung Exynos 88-90 or a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor as
well as 6 gigabytes of RAM a battery
with somewhere between 3,500 to 4,000
milliamp hours on the storage side three
options are suggested 64 gigabytes 128
gigabytes and a 256 gigabyte option now
let's talk the HTC 10 as its launch is
fast approaching the teasing has now
reached a new height as HTC has finally
unveiled the date plans to launch its
2016 flagship and that is April 12th the
event kicks off at 8 a.m. Eastern and
just like the a9 before it is an
online-only event yet it lists the times
for New York London and Taipei but the
event itself will be conducted via the
web in 2014 HTC launched and started
selling the One m8 flagship on the very
same day though the m9 didn't come quite
as quickly what about this year's
flagship it's hard to say for sure
though
previous rumors suggested the phone
might hit retailers on the 16th of April
less than a week after its announcement
as for the specs we don't know for sure
what HTC will deliver just yet though
the rumor mill claims that we're looking
at a phone powered with a snapdragon 820
processor 4 gigabytes of RAM a 5.1 5
inch quad HD display at 12 megapixel
main shooter and a 3000 milliamp hour
battery and support for USB type-c on
the design front the HTC 10 is expected
to take more inspiration from the HTC
One a9 than the HTC One m9 whether this
is a step up or step down depends on who
you ask
though many question HTC's decision to
move away from its front-facing
boomsound speaker set up which was
billed as one of its biggest selling
points in the past now let's talk the
new Google Voice the janky robotic voice
of Google search results that we've all
come to love or at least in us English
is now being retired Google is rolling
out a new smoother and less disjointed
voice for spoken search results as you
can hear here the Empire State Building
is 1,250 feet tall how tall is the
Empire State Building the Empire State
Building is 1,250 feet tall the more
natural intonation and fluid delivery
are much more lifelike and the gaps
between words are almost impossible to
hear it seems to be a server-side google
text-to-speech engine change because the
Play Store is not showing any available
updates nor are the latest apks of
Google TTS and the Google app now if
you're not using us English as your
default and want to see if you have the
new voice or you just want to check out
other accents go to settings language
and input text to speech output settings
and language to choose your system
language if necessary go to install
voice data and choose a language pack to
download unleash your team's potential
with Atlassian's collaboration software
so you can work and communicate better
together a sign track and manage tasks
for any project no matter how complex
that's the clarity of JIRA creating
share content organize results and bring
team members up to speed that's the
flexibility of
now what I like about Atlassian the most
is that it doesn't constrict me to
communicating with my team in one way if
I don't want to chat it out in the chat
box I can go to video chat and that is a
good thing
that's Atlassian comm unleash the
potential of your team build what's next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
