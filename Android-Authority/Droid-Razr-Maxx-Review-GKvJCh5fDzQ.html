we'll hear from the android authority
and today I've got
review for you it is the droid razr maxx
one of the
dissipated phones of 2012 I never really
thought that Motorola would come out
with a really cool flagship device that
would suit needs like the razor did but
you know this is a razr maxx really
what's different about this phone is the
battery and i believe the internal
storage is cut in hell will get into
this now I have another razor with me
right now this is a this is the mac so
we have right here and then this that is
the normal razor ok this is the regular
right as you pick up the store right now
so you can see it's got the curvature ok
it's a little more lighter of course
sure to compare them right there okay
see this is more flat this is less this
is what I mean this is more thin there's
really not a big difference in weight
this of course is heavier but I mean
compared to like phone that i have my
pocket right now the Galaxy Nexus you
know of course the Nexus is screen is a
little bit larger to compare them like
this but honestly the razr maxx seems
like a sweet phone
front and center right here this phone
is pretty sweet it's got a 1.2 gigahertz
dual-core TI omap processor course di
means texas instrument that one gig of
ram it's got the one thing has different
from this phone and this like it props
to is that this has 16 gigabytes of
onboard memory this has 32 they both are
expandable to 32 on the SD card but
internally this is half as this
it's got motoblur same stuff that the
razor has just about you know it's kind
of laggy motoblur that's why one of the
reasons i never got the razor is because
i have to install a new rom and I get
scared of installing new rounds and is
on a removable battery but anyway let's
get into the settings I forgot yes this
actually has buttoned school settings
sorry focus there huh and I'll show you
some of the so we've got droid razr to
two point three point five Android you
know all the same stuff from them
gingerbread of course I have no idea
when this phone be released on Ice Cream
Sandwich the only date that I've got was
like februari or march and i don't even
know if that's gonna happen um I think
March is going to be a great date for
this phone now besides the battery and
the storage this really this phone has
really nothing going for it I mean the
3300 milliamp hours is very impressive
in my opinion but in all honesty this
phone should have been a little more it
should have been like like a 1.5
gigahertz because really all you're
really paying for is the battery the
only advantage of this phone is a bad or
the new accessories all these from all
the screen protectors and see on this
phone right there you can see the screen
protectors on blinding are compatible
with the razr maxx it's the same screen
4.3 inch super amoled all right however
cases since this is a flat more it's
more flat until it gets up rather than
the curve style you're looking at
different cases and more money to spend
yes it's very difficult they should have
created something like the same style
with the better battery but I don't know
if they could do that but yeah you're
gonna have to buy if you want to upgrade
this phone from the razor you'd have to
buy all new cases I think for whatever
docs they'd have depending on the dock
you have upgrade your dock as well but
that's about it screen protectors work
you know the cables work it's the same
basically the same phone
I really want ice cream stand on this
phone if this if you can get it-- when
the update is available for this phone
this will beat the Gulf anyway this is
the this is the droid razr maxx one of
the most highly anticipated phones like
i said running on two point two point
five Android this is a great to have it
in my presence right now and to see it I
can't wait till what Motorola brings
motor was going to pack up punch for at
least the end of the year they got to
bring on something quad-core we're
looking at the motorola bullet the
motorola jet something cool that's what
we're looking at this is the droid razr
maxx by motorola can find it on verizon
for 299 on a two-year contract i'm going
to try to get a purple razor out as well
as the white razor because i haven't
done a review on that so the purple and
white side by side with each other in
the next couple dates my name is will
from the android authority and this is
the droid razr maxx</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
