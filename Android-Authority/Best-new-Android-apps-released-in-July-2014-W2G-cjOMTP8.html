handy the Android authority app guy it's
nearing the end of July which means it's
time to go back and round up the best
applications that were released this
month
first up is an application called bamboo
paper by Wacom it's a doodling and
notetaking application that focuses on
precision but there are some built-in
features that are pretty nice too there
are some issues that users have pointed
out but overall the attitude toward this
application has been pretty positive
it's free to use so there's no harm in
giving it a shot
commander was released to a lot of
fanfare this application extends the
functionality of Google now by letting
you do things like turn on and off
various utilities like the flashlight
and Bluetooth with your voice through
Google now there is also Tasker support
and a healthy stream of suggestions that
the developers are actively working to
include it's free and if you use Google
now at all then this is a must-have
application after it was used to demo
Android TV at Google i/o the masses
waited fervently for Leo's fortune to be
released then it was and predictably it
was pretty popular it costs $4.99 but
between its smooth gameplay amazing
graphics and high Google Playstore
rating we don't think there are too many
people who were disappointed to shell
out that much for this really good game
Lok Lak is a new messaging service where
every message takes place on your
lockscreen this can be a fun way to
communicate with friends as you can do
it'll take pictures and doodle over
pictures if you so choose it's free to
use but don't put anything personal in
the messages because it'll show up
directly on the lockscreen of the
recipients and that could be a bad thing
modern combat 5 can be described as one
of the blockbuster game releases of the
year for Android with it comes improved
graphics multiplayer support and more
campaign missions to do there have been
some early bugs but pretty much every
big game release goes through stuff like
this so if you're not sure just wait a
few weeks for the fixes before buying it
but it is really a good game this
vehicle is a new social media service
that specializes in being totally
anonymous when you sign up for an
account you don't need to provide any
details about yourself you aren't even
allowed to have a profile picture once
signed up you can literally say whatever
you want and it remains totally
anonymous to everyone it's great if you
want to rant and rave about something
but not on regular social media where it
can get you in trouble and frankly this
is where every person who vague books
ought to be next up is a game called
swipe and it's the first game designs
typically for Android wear with this
game you fling blocks around to match
colors which then make them disappear
and you get points for it it cost $1 69
but it also comes with an online
multiplayer component and even a phone
version if you want to play it there
it's not a bad deal even if it's bit of
a tired premise if you're looking for
the obnoxious game of the month then
timber man is your best bets at gain
mainstream popularity after the fad
blogs decided it was the next best hard
game after flappy bird died off it's
free with ads but you can pay to remove
the ads if you prefer it's easy to play
and we've no doubt you'll get the hang
of hating it so much that you can't stop
playing it list up this month is the
where mini launcher this launcher allows
you to operate your Android wear device
more closely to a normal Android device
by giving you an application drawer
that's almost always easy to get to it
has a lot of positive reviews it's free
and it's easy to use who could ask for
more than that once again i'm joe hindi
