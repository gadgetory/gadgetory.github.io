Nexus device appropriately named to the
Nexus one now we are in a new era of
seemingly ultra powerful seemingly
forever evolving smartphones at this
point however for whatever reason when
Google was going to release their new
version of the Nexus device into this
new era they didn't make a big deal
about it with announcements and
subsequent releases and actually I would
argue that they probably didn't need to
but that was then and it's Josh regard
for management authority of what's going
on everybody and this is the Nexus 5 now
if anything what the Nexus 5 first
taught us was that it was pretty much
clear now that LG was consistently
getting Google's nod after the
successful Nexus 4 it was probably only
sensible to continue that momentum but
what struck many users was the lack of a
full press release or announcement It
was as if the Nexus 5 just appeared in
the Google Play Store like hey I know
you've been waiting and because of all
of the leaks that have been happening
you probably know everything there is to
know about me already anyway so you know
what Here I am but the lack of fanfare
did not keep this phone from selling
like crazy
both this version and also it's panda
white sibling and it became a bit of a
norm to see the words sold out there for
a while on the Google Play Store listing
for the Nexus 5 but even if it was very
simplistic in its design inside and out
it was still very competitive in its
specifications and most importantly in
its price at $350 you had a phone that
was above average and was still able to
bring you a really great experience for
a price that actually was not too hard
to swallow I mean sure it might be
better considered a reference device as
the Nexus once was in its early
iterations but even if it was a
reference device for the industry and
for developers alike once you had that
that smaller price point tacked on to
the promise of a pure and totally
powerful updated Android experience well
it was only a matter of time before the
general consumers got crazy about it -
that was the story with the Nexus floor
and with the Nexus 5 it was only going
to continue but now months later the
Nexus 5 continues its stoic unobtrusive
foray
into Android users palms yes it's
minimalistic design was once thought of
as perhaps a step back from the more
daring design of the Nexus 4 with its
glass on glass but as it was in the
beginning it still remains
simplistically elegant in my eyes
underneath the hood its top tier power
package remains really reliable and
snappy especially considering that it is
really unpark 'it today and also it
powers the most advanced version of
android currently available now one of
the main gripes in the beginning when it
came to the Nexus 5 was with its
mediocre battery life and initially it
was a big downside but I will admit that
after my usage on this phone started to
taper off and sort of even out that the
battery life started to become very
decidedly average but there are plenty
of times when still I feel like I'm
reaching for my charging cable earlier
than I probably think I should and then
an update to the camera software did do
well to make the imaging experience
serviceable if still not quite top-tier
I do have a full video showing what the
update did to the camera and while there
are improvements I still wouldn't say
that this camera is anywhere near the
best ones out there so it should come as
a little surprised where the appeal and
the success of the Nexus 5 generally
comes from and yes it is due to the
software experience as still one of the
only devices available with 4.4 KitKat
the value of the Nexus truly remains and
it brings an experience powerful enough
to successfully use on the daily without
being overbearing lis feature or even
designed crazy now depending on your
particular setup the number of Hoops
that you have to go through in order to
reach your destination on your phone is
still considerably fewer here than when
compared to pretty much almost any other
Android iteration out there even
particular features like having Google
now as your second screen and even a
voice command by saying OK Google allows
you to have a better search experience
that is actually pretty fun all in all
stock Android continues to show you its
clouds mostly through its Search
application but also it doesn't get in
the way when you want to really cater
the experience on this phone to your
after all that ready canvas may be more
important to a lot of users out there
than any particular extras that a
manufacturer might cook up on their
particular phones and in the end that is
probably what makes the Nexus 5 many
people's first choice it's simply
because it gives you what you need and
more importantly it won't fight you on
the way to where you need to go so
coming back to this whole idea of the
release kind of foreshadowing what the
experience is on the Nexus 5 yes in the
beginning maybe the release wasn't as
flashy as people sort of expected and
there wasn't a whole lot of fanfare for
but you still got exactly what you
needed and I think that's a nice
metaphor for the experience in the Nexus
5 in general so the Nexus 5 proves once
again the value of the Nexus line and as
far as the Nexus 5 goes it is definitely
one of my daily driver simply because
there's something that has to be said
about a phone that you can literally
just pick up and it does what you needed
to do without really any fuss and that's
the point I've been trying to make here
but unfortunately this might be the last
Nexus that we see from the line and that
is something I wanted to address see on
this final note I wanted to address the
rumor that the Nexus line might actually
cease to exist not necessarily that the
entire line would go away but in the
fact that the Nexus as a branding might
also go away - those are the two sides
of the speculation now as a general move
I can kind of understand where Google is
coming from because they kind of want to
get the other manufacturers in line when
it comes to modifying Android as crazily
as they sometimes do but I would still
argue once again that the value of the
Nexus line has been proven time and time
again at first as a reference device for
developers and for industry people alike
but also later on starting with the
Nexus floor as an affordable yet
powerful and very updated and pure form
of Android available on a handset that
was not only attractive but was very
competitive and so without the Nexus
what we could posit is in the future we
would have to rely on the much more
expensive Google Play editions to get
our pure Android fix and that might not
be a very happy notion to a lot of
people and speaking of those updates it
is until 2015 that we can wait to see if
these rumors come out and
are actually true and when it comes to
the Nexus 5 it should still get its
updates until that time comes and
luckily if you still want the same pure
Android experience that you've come to
love since the beginning of the Nexus
well the Nexus 5 should be able to have
some staying power and keep you happy
until that time comes and when it's all
said and done I guess we're just gonna
have to keep our fingers crossed that
the Nexus 5 isn't the end of our Nexus
journey so keep it tuned to Android
