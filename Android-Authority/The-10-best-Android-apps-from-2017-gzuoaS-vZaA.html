hindi the android authority app guy and
it's about that time to round up the
best new android apps that were released
over the course of all of 2017 there are
no more words so let's get started
the original ADW launcher was one of the
best and most popular Android launchers
it disappeared for quite some time
before returning as ADW launcher to the
launch of atw launcher to marked the
return of one of the greats
the latest release also includes new
features a new modern layout and more
modern elements it features broad
customization features gesture support
extensions support for custom icons a
widget maker any ton of other stuff it
was one of the few apps that ever went
straight from release to one of our best
lists and at three dollars and 49 cents
it's downright reasonable we hope this
one sticks around for a long long time
glass wire is a security application
from around March of this year it
monitors data usage for individual apps
over both Wi-Fi and mobile data it's not
the most unique idea however we loved
how glasswire executed with this one you
can monitor data usage in real time
across any number of applications and it
also alerts you when you're close to
your data cap once you've defined one it
also works for some privacy since you
can see what apps are using what and
when the application had a few minor
mishaps in the first few months but it's
definitely one of the easiest apps like
this one it's pro version is also cheap
at 99 cents Google did two not-so-great
things in 2017 they didn't release the
pixel launcher to the masses and they
also announced the end of Google now
launcher this left a rather large gap in
the Android launcher space that launch
air launcher fills perfectly it features
a modern pixel style design with Google
now integration which does require an
optional plugin notification dots
Android Oreo shortcuts and a lot more it
also has a few additional customization
features like icon pack supports
variable icon and grid sizes adaptive
icons and more the application is free
open source and has no advertising there
are other launchers with similar looks
and feels
however launch here takes a lighter
approach that minimalists will
appreciate we
recommend this one enough even if it is
still in beta to start with no Microsoft
did not pay us to put this here and
frankly we're as surprised as you are
that it made the list Microsoft's mobile
edge browser changed a lot of
conversations it allows for
cross-platform syncing between desktop
and mobile features previously only held
by opera Google Chrome and Firefox
additionally it's yet another Microsoft
application that integrates between
Windows and Android which are the
world's two most popular operating
systems in terms of pure functionality
this browser is a little basic however
let's face facts this one is going to
get way better over the next few years
it already has over a million downloads
and it's also free socratic is easily
the best education app from 2017 it
works as a helper of sorts you snap a
photo of your homework problem and the
applications AI figures out the concepts
you need to learn in order to solve the
problem it works with a variety of
subjects including history math science
economics and even some English Socratic
hits that good middle ground where
people still need to learn the concepts
but it also gives enough information to
actually be helpful the service boasts
over 100 million questions solved
already and it's also free to use today
whether received a ton of critical
acclaim upon release and even google
lists it as one of the top picks of 2017
the application features a modern simple
design and that really helps keep the
app from feeling cluttered with all of
the information that it provides some of
the other features include the current
forecast future forecasts a
multifunction weather radar widgets
alerts an hourly forecast and more from
five different weather sources seriously
this is one gorgeous and functional
weather app and there really isn't much
wrong with it
vrv is technically from the very very
end of 2016 however we did think it
should carry over into this year and
here is why it's the best streaming
service for anime and independent
production period
it features Funimation at crunchyroll
and over half a dozen other production
companies including roosterteeth Nerdist
geek and sundry and others its inclusion
of Funimation gives us a great selection
of dubbed anime while crunchyroll
provides tons of the latest subbed anime
there are also tons of other stuff from
the aforementioned studios those who
like anime should definitely have this
without question and the rest of it is a
very satisfying cherry on a very
satisfying streaming service
what the forecast is a rather charming
weather app its main feature is giving
you clever humorous clips about the
current weather some of the weather
features include the current forecast
the real field temperature a 7-day
forecast a glossary weather terms and
more
additionally the app boasts 6600 phrases
about the weather that should keep most
fans of the app going for quite some
time it's not as powerful as something
like today weather however it's a
totally enjoyable and fun application
for those who just need the basics and
also want to laugh a bit YouTube TV was
a revelation there are other internet TV
offerings like PlayStation View sling TV
and others however YouTube TV was
arguably the biggest such release it
features over 40 channels cloud DVR and
support for up to six accounts per
household
it puts internet TV in the biggest
spotlight that it's ever been in and we
like that a lot the rollout is taking
forever but with just under a hundred
cities YouTube TV is slowly making its
way around these services may replace
cable TV someday and 2017 was the year
where they really started catching
people's attention we did put sling TV
on our list for the best apps of 2015 so
at least we're consistent
Google's movies anywhere takes our top
spot for the best application of 2017
and it's more for a philosophical reason
than a functional one we live in a tech
industry that tries to keep us in twine
inside of an ecosystem you buy stuff on
a platform but it's only accessible on
that specific platform and nowhere else
movies anywhere is a delightful trip in
the opposite direction
it supports movie purchases from Amazon
Google Play Disney movies anywhere
iTunes and Vudu that way you can shop
around and still watch all of your
movies in a single spot the application
does have some technical difficulties
however it is Google and it seems to be
getting more stable with each update
this one should get better over the
coming years and we certainly hope to
see more stuff like this for music TV
shows books and maybe even some other
stuff and that about does it for this
one folks if you don't agree with these
decisions that's fine leave a comment
and tell us what you think the best apps
of 2017 were don't forget to hit the
subscribe button and ring the bell to
get the latest android authority videos
as soon as they come out and as always
thanks for watching everybody and have a
wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
