finally anyone with the Nexus 4 and an
itch to ditch the cord has Google's
peripheral now available hey it's josh
refer Garthim android authority what's
going on everybody and this is the nexus
wireless charging orb of course we're
talking about the nexus wireless
charging orb it's an attractive piece of
equipment that does exactly and I mean
it exactly what it sets out to do so
what is there to say about the orb it's
a small orb essentially cut in half and
then put at an angle at 130 grams it
really isn't that heavy at all but it
can make a good paper weight if you
really need it this allows you to set
your phone down and still be able to get
a good glance at it too so your Nexus 4
or for that matter any phone capable of
wireless Qi charging as the droid DNA
worked on it too can be set in portrait
or landscape mode for media viewing it
sticks softly to the orb not by magnets
but by the plastic material found around
the middle around the back of the orb is
a micro USB charging port that you will
use with the included cord that then
goes into the wall standard stuff and
then well that's about it wireless
charging is pretty cool admittedly but
that's literally all it does the
wireless charging orb does its job in
style however as far as the charging
time goes there are a lot of factors
that can change it one way or another
but the quick start guide says that
about four hours should be able to
charge a 2150 milliamp hour battery my
completely dead Nexus 4 1 from 0 to 100
and under six though not too bad if you
consider an overnight charge but also
you will get into the habit of just
plopping the phone on the orb when you
get back to your desk so that is all
charging time too so the orb will set
you back about 60 bucks which is a
little bit of a hefty price for such a
singular performing piece of equipment
there are now plenty of other qi
wireless chargers out there with the
same capabilities but the orb does have
a design advantage having the phone at
an angle takes advantage of the daydream
function so you suddenly have an extra
clock or a photo frame or even a
jellybean flinger on your desk even when
writing this review I took advantage of
the angle by using a Pomodoro timer on
my nexus for a while I was writing so to
conclude I will say one thing
I've never really given wireless
charging much thought but now with the
orb I'm pretty convinced instead of
fiddling to find my cords and connect
them to my phone just plopping my Nexus
4 onto the stand is easier by far so did
you get your own Nexus wireless charging
orb when they became available let us

that head over to android authority calm
