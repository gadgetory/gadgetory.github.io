much of the established formula to
create what might be one of their best
devices yet this is Joshua Fogg our from
Android Authority what's going on
everybody and this is the Samsung Galaxy
s6 a new material choice in the design
is perhaps the main headline of the
galaxy s6 what was once a glossy plastic
finish in a dimple the backing is now a
metal frame with glass on both sides
though some of the design cues might
seem to come from specific sources of
inspiration the Essex still retains the
Samsung aesthetic with its shape and
button layout making very clear that
this is still a galaxy device the middle
frame is a very welcome change with the
button layout following suit as the
power button and the volume rockers now
have a very meaty and reassuring press
and click to them and the buttons up
front are still comprised of the tactile
home button flanked by recent apps and
back capacitive keys and even then the
metallic frame has some of the tapered
rises on the top and bottom halves that
are reminiscent of the Galaxy Note 4's
frame the vast majority of the phone's
hardware is found on the bottom now with
the microUSB charging port now flanked
by both the headphone jack and the newly
located speaker grille 2.5 D glass adds
a little dimension to the glass atop the
display and now the backing itself is
made of glass there are some obvious
issues with this design choice because
the backing is no longer removable and
thus a couple of key features go by the
wayside replaceable battery and
expandable storage this will be the
topic of debate for quite some time I'm
sure as many users have grown accustomed
to having these two features in their
galaxy phones the camera optics are up
top on the back accompanying by the
heart rate monitor that is now
vertically placed in order to better
capture the finger it is monitoring now
the main issue I always had was with the
camera because it sticks out quite a bit
now I know that I say this a lot about
similarly constructed cameras but with
the galaxy s6 this became a real-world
issue when I was trying to shoot the
phone standing up on location a gust of
wind simply just made the phone go splat
like that but when I picked up the phone
and looked at the glass that covers the
lens there was a crack now thankfully
this was just a cosmetic issue and it
did not hinder the camera experience one
bit still it's very unfortunate that it
even happened and though it might have
been acing
situation in my case it still didn't
make me feel very secure about the
crystal that is supposed to protect the
camera on this phone aside from just the
material change what is also noticed
about the s6 is its light weight it's
pretty easy to handle this phone and
keeping the screen around the 5-inch
size keeps this phone accessible for the
vast majority of users though there was
some slippage from time to time it
definitely didn't keep me from rating
the s6 as a very comfortable phone to
use I can't help but think that the
people who use to lament the plastic
build on samsung devices are going to be
happy now and then everybody else now
are going to be upset because those
users who wanted their Samsung devices
to pretty much literally be everything
to them are just not going to get it in
this version replaceable batteries and
expandable storage have gone by the
wayside but it's going to be up to you
to figure out if those are actually
going to be deal-breakers nonetheless
this might just be one of the
best-looking phones that Samsung has
ever made and we are quite happy with
the step forward that Samsung has taken
this long to finally take a 5.1 inch
display as I mentioned already keeps the
phone accessible for plenty of users who
don't want to go up to the growing group
of sub six-inch phones but even if you
settle for this size of screen you'll
still get all of the power with the
Super AMOLED display that now comes in a
quad HD resolution Super AMOLED will
bring what many of its fans already
enjoy deep blacks and highly vivid
colors that are Samsung's signature with
the full freedom to still change the
color saturation if it is too much for
you and with the high resolution just
about everything on this device looks
absolutely gorgeous text is incredibly
sharp with the 577 pixels per inch
videos are a blast to watch even if the
full 2k resolution isn't really being
taken full advantage of and I've already
played and enjoyed my fair share of
games viewing the phone in broad
daylight is not difficult at all though
some issues with glare were expected and
observed but at full brightness I still
had few issues getting things done in an
incredibly open and sunny area of SoCal
I noticed that was such a dense display
it is also a little sensitive swiping
down the notification drop-down requires
just the right kind of flick and even a
small touch from the skin on the sides
of the device when playing games for
example can mean the difference between
living and dying in it these aren't
necessarily issues per se but things
that I simply noticed when using the s6
and perhaps they are testaments to how
advanced the screen is on
of just being one of the best viewing
experiences available now in the galaxy
s6 Samsung set a precedent by not
looking to Qualcomm this time around for
their chipsets the Korean giant has been
making processes of their own for quite
some time now and it looks like the s6
is the Exynos coming-out party so
globally the exceed no 7420 processor
will power the s6 bringing 2.1 gigahertz
of performance with the mali t760 and 3
gigabytes of ram backing it up it almost
made perfect sense to me that Samsung
would optimize their operating system
for their own processing packages and it
looks like this combination has actually
paid off performance on the s6
absolutely screams with even the normal
movements through the TouchWiz interface
speedily going along in smooth
transitions hitting the recent apps
screen and jumping among the
applications is a breeze the performance
of the galaxy s6 is perhaps most easily
demonstrated though by the camera
shortcut simply double tap the home
button and the camera application will
gingerly slide up from the bottom in
under a second and almost every single
time it will do so without a hitch the
multi graphics also do well to produce a
good gaming experience and the only
slowdown I noticed was when there were
too many things happening on screen like
let's say all the explosions and Sky
Force but even then the stutter was
cosmetic and the game speed itself did
not let up where you might have always
noticed and got maybe angered by the
stutters and slowdowns of TouchWiz we
now have one of the smoothest iterations
of Samsung's UI yet and it only further
justifies Samsung's move to stick with
the processors that they've made
in-house but now in the hardware segment
we might see some of the appeal fading
because where we once looked to Samsung
as at least having all of the features
that other devices didn't we are now
seeing a dialing back of that very
philosophy let's get one of the audience
holes out of the way right now
expandable storage while it is an issue
that even I am a little bit peeved about
the bottom line here is that with the
galaxy s6 there are no slots or trays
anymore on the samsung galaxy device
that you will able to put your microSD
cards in and you might start to collect
a little bit of dust in this iteration
and while this is definitely an issue
for most the s6 will at least now come
with a minimum 32 gigabyte storage
option with 64 and 128 gigabyte options
available for those
powered users who do need that space
connectivity was no issue with the phone
easily connecting to my LTE networks on
t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T and the call quality
proving to be as good as ever and
speaking of sound the s6 is probably the
best speaker experience Samsung has ever
put out on a flagship with the bottom
located speaker bringing some pretty
loud audio enjoyable and even some noisy
environments it still isn't as good as
front-facing speakers but it's vastly
superior to any of the rear mounted
units Samsung has used in the past
you
the heart rate monitor makes a return
and works a little better this time
around mainly because of its orientation
even if you don't use it very often the
updated s health application and the
ability to use the sensor as a trigger
for self-portrait camera shots give it a
couple extra capabilities underneath the
home button is the fingerprint scanner
now that is a press type which is much
better than the swipe version found in
previous iterations unlocking the phone
gets easier now as you can just wake the
phone by pressing the home button and
leave your finger on the button and in a
moment the phone opens up what we like
most about this is that unlocking the
phone in this method is finally about as
fast as it would be with the typical
swipe method and finally we make it to
the battery a non removable one which is
an issue for plenty of people that is
also a little smaller than previously
found in Galaxy devices 25 50 milliamp
hours is its capacity and with the quad
HD display it's easy to dismiss the
gallery life of the s 6 s subpar but
that's only half the story now what I
didn't mention in the performance aspect
was that the processor in the Galaxy S
six is now over 14 nanometer
construction what this basically means
is that the same data transmission can
be done on a smaller area and this
supposedly is supposed to help power
consumption unfortunately when you
factor in all of the other powerful
specs on here including the screen the
battery life just seemed to even out
rather than get better than before as
such the s6 performs about where you
would expect a bit over the full day of
work for the typical user with the power
user probably relying on the power
saving modes and the occasional
connection to a fast charger or a
wireless charging dock because the s6
supports wireless charging out of the
box to say that it is a bummer the s6
isn't an overachiever in the battery
life Department is unfortunate but the
fact that it is an average performer at
best is something we quite frankly
expect it to say hardware is rounded out
by the camera package which brings some
of the best specifications we've seen
from a Samsung device 16 megapixels in
the rear facing unit and 5 megapixels in
the front with both shooters sporting f
1.9 apertures for better low-light shots
and auto HDR modes to easily add a pop
to photos what's easy to see in the
camera app is that things have been
dialed back a bit with elements on the
viewfinder relegated to the sides until
you hit the pro mode which is a very
welcome addition while pro modes aren't
necessarily very
knew what I personally enjoyed about
this one is the ability to manually
adjust the focus this to me is a better
way to take advantage of the depth of
field and F 1.9 aperture provides though
if you do prefer to change the focus of
a shot after the fact instead the
selective focus mode is still available
panorama in virtual shot modes are
available too if you want to get fancy
and the panoramic captured does well to
keep stitching to a minimum unless your
subjects are moving way too much and
video can be captured in slow motion or
in 4k though both of these modes will
not have the benefit of HDR and various
other enhancements 1080p video capture
gets the front-facing camera though not
an overachiever is more than enough for
self-portraits and just about any
situation and having HDR available means
you can get a somewhat better shot if
you need a better exposure compensation
though the viewfinder might not always
show you how good the photo will turn
out in live view the pictures I got in
situations where I expected lackluster
quality frequently turned out better
having HDR on auto takes the guesswork
out of double exposure situations but I
do think that its effect is too light in
good lighting the camera gets highly
detailed very vivid photos that are
worthy of everything from social media
to capturing key moments and rarely did
I get a dull photo auto focus tracking
proved to be useful for moving subjects
as the camera did well to keep focus
steady and had few missteps it is
certainly better than feverishly tapping
on the screen yourself and in lower
light situations the F 1.9 aperture
definitely helped though there is a law
of diminishing returns as the light gets
dimmer but for these shots in the dead
of night outside I was still pretty
impressed with what came out and I was
even more impressed when I zoomed in
normally on Android camera zooming into
the darker spots of a photo reveals
smudges and overly fuzzy interpretations
of the captured noise after all it's not
necessarily how much the camera will be
able to capture but what is done to that
data after the photo was taken but in
the galaxy s6 the noise is largely left
alone so the portrayal of the scene
remains pretty accurate this is a much
better way of handling the lower light
situations as you get the photo just the
way it can be given and the photo
doesn't get any worse than it should be
because of shoddy post-processing in the
end when the best camera is the one you
have on you you can do so much worse in
the galaxy s6 and that's really saying
something when it comes to software one
of the first things we noticed about the
galaxy s6 is that in this
version of TouchWiz we no longer have
all of those sounds that used to annoy
us from before everything from those
water sounds to the water droplets that
were happening are now replaced by much
simpler sounds like just a click and
this story of trimming down continues
when you get to the settings screen many
of the features that oversaturate
previous Galaxy S devices are nowhere to
be found like the air gestures or the
toolbox and even the settings screen
itself is not an incredible mess of
dozens and dozens of circle icons this
time it's a simple list with an easily
editable quick settings area on top the
notification drop-down is still of the
signature Samsung iteration made a
little bit easier on the eyes with the
lollipop aesthetic put in and speaking
of lollipop the recent apps screen has
the card layout but it is also the place
where multi window can be activated
either hold down the recent apps button
to be guided into creating your dual
panel or press the icon found on any of
the compatible cards the next thing we
noticed in this touch wiz was the lack
of incessant tutorials rather than
throwing all of its capabilities in the
users face the galaxy s6 seems content
to be used based on the user's own
sensibilities and if that person wanted
the extra Samsung capabilities they're
available if they know how to trigger
them the multi window is the main
example of this but there is also the
small window capability that was
originally introduced in the note 4
which I accidentally discovered on my
own when swiping down from the top sure
enough this feature is still available
by swiping from any top corner to create
a smaller version of my screen which
could then be made into a multi window
setup or a floating icon for safekeeping
and nowhere in this situation was I
interrupted with an annoying tutorial
screen with many of the questionable
features of TouchWiz also go many of
these Samsung applications that are now
no longer pre-installed but I do tip my
hat to the new look in s-health which is
a bit more attractive to look at as I
check my heart rate from time to time
this dialing back of the software is a
refreshing change of pace even if touch
which still looks a little too bubbly or
is a bit too colourful like before but
there's even an answer for that as the
s6 introduces a theme store where you
can find and install a whole new look
for the interface it's not the most
customizable version of themes we've
seen but it's a big step in the right
direction as already mentioned before
the galaxy s6 absolutely flies through
all of its elements even through the
overachieving features like the multi
window and the S window functionality
that I just showed you so what's great
about the galaxy s6 is that if you are
used
just the typical Android experience you
get it skins via TouchWiz but the
experience is still as smooth and as
speedy as it should be and then if you
want to dig a little bit deeper you can
find those extra features without
TouchWiz parading itself all over your
face on the daily this is definitely one
of the smoothest and easy a software
experiences Samsung has ever put out and
it stands as one of the best in this
current crop of flagship devices this
year now we don't quite know what the
price will be on carriers in the States
but the s6 should come out at the
typical prices on contracts with the
equally typical price of around or at
least $700 unlocked it is a flagship
device after all for even more premium
price the s6 edge is a choice that
brings a unique take on the galaxy s
experience though our review will soon
give the verdict on whether the edges
are worth it and of course other
flagships this year will contend with
the s6 like the HTC One m9 which is very
soon on the market and in our hands for
a review and of course the usual main
competitor the iPhone 6 sometimes a
company needs a different perspective to
gain all of its attention back and with
the galaxy s6 Samsung has definitely
brought back quite a bit of the buzz at
lost in the s4 and 5 a pretty drastic
change in design philosophy brings one
of the best-looking and handling devices
the Galaxy S line has ever had but
sacrifices some of the key elements that
Samsung fans Pine over if I'm honest I
haven't really carried a spare battery
nor used any of them for any of the
phones that support them in the past
let's say two years and even then it's
been a while since I've used a microSD
card inside of any of my daily driver so
the lack of expandable storage even
though it is a bit of a sore point for
me is not something that I truly need in
this for my daily driver but I do
realize that I'm only one half of the
story one side of the story in this new
chapter in Samsung's history it is yet
another polarizing phone to the masses
just like iterations from before but
perhaps for different reasons now but
for all that has changed on the outside
what has changed on the inside might
even out the negatives TouchWiz is
better than ever which is something I
kind of never thought I'd say the camera
experience continues to improve and
keeps Samsung among the top Android
shooters and a powerful screen and
processor underneath it lent to an
easily recommended daily driver for many
users whether forward or backward
song has finally shifted in a number of
key areas and the s6 is the change we've
been waiting for and the result is one
of the best devices they've ever put out
one that won't as easily fade into
obscurity the way its predecessors did

or so to really show you how it fares
against a competition I have a camera
shootout that is really close to coming
out so you make sure you stay tuned for
that and then I will be pitting this
phone against all of the major flagships
including the iPhone and the HTC One m9
in the coming days so keep it tuned here
