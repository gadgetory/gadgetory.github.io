what's going on everybody and we are
here at the Archos booth at Aoife in
Berlin now Argos holds a very special
place in my heart because one of their
first devices way back 10 years ago was
one of the first devices I had that got
me into technology and Here I am 10
years later 10 plushies they're looking
at their Android smartphone what we're
looking at here is the very recently
announced just before Aoife the oxygen
50 is their flagship phone the oxygen is
their flagship line there are actually
you might be able to see in the
background there there are a bunch of
phones that's only a fraction of what
they offer there is the oxygen line the
platinum line and the titanium line all
that order being from high to mid to
lower range what we're looking at here
is the oxygen 50 now this this right
here is definitely a phone that can call
itself a more high-end device we're
working with here is a full HD 5-inch
screen and is an IPS screen so of course
it lends itself to a lot of great
brightness if you go here and I ring all
the way up things start to get washed
out here on the video so we're just
gonna bring it back down for the sake of
our video but as you can see it is a
greatly greatly bright screen and it
works very wonderfully on this device
our capacitive keys on the bottom here
the usual button layout of the power on
the right side and the volume rocker
here on the left side but after that you
have a such you have a soft touch
plastic rather as very nice to the touch
might get a little bit smudgy depending
on you know how many hands we have been
on in this case there have been a lot
but it's still a nice feel as you can
see in the curve on the bottom it
definitely rests really easy in your
hand because of this nice and very
substantial curve that you have of
course here's the micro USB slot
okay and then it comes with 16 gigabytes
of storage is a quad-core 1.5 gigahertz
mediatek processor powering the stock
vanilla Android as Arcos as a partner as
an official partner with Google they are
able to have the full stock experience
maybe with a few tweaks here and there
but still definitely the vanilla Android
experience so that's definitely
something that many of us will
definitely like about this phone
first impressions honestly this this
this phone really feels really great
it's very thin it's very lightweight and
it it handles really easily in the hand
it's actually really really nice the
speed is there with the mediatek
processor right there you can see it
goes along quite smoothly now mediatek
might not be a Qualcomm processor it
might not have the full snappiness but
I'm sure that the mediatek quad-core
processor in this particular phone will
be able to power it and give you a
reliable experience now like I said
before Arcos has a number of lines for
their smartphone offerings the other
lines being the Platinum line and the
titanium line they all come in a bunch
of different sizes this of course is
called the 50 because as a 5 inch screen
but there's also the Platinum 53 for
example that is the mid-range the more
mid-range device now the only reason why
it's mid-range is because it doesn't
come with a full HD screen but it comes
in at five point three inches and has a
dual core processor so once again that
is the oxygen 50 we're looking at the
flagship here at the Archos booth at
Aoife in Berlin make sure you stay tuned
and also if you wanted a good Android
smartphone the other range that is
available as you can see a bunch of the
other phones there are a lot of
different phones in different sizes with
different specs but also different price
points so if you're looking for an
affordable smartphone Arcos might be one
of those places that is perfect
so once again is the Josh magar from
Android authority we're here at the
Arcos booth at Aoife bringing you all
the best coverage from Berlin so make
sure you stay tuned to Android thority
because we're your source for all things
