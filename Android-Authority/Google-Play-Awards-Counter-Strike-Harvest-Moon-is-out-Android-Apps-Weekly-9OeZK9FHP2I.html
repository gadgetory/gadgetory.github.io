handy the Android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly this
is episode number 137 so let's jump
right in Google has unveiled its plans
to give official Google Playstore awards
starting at Google i/o this year it will
be called the play awards and the
categories are stand out startup
standout indie best families app best
use of material design best use of
Google Play game services early adopter
go global most innovative and of course
the best app and best game it'll be
interesting to see who wins but I really
hope it's not freakin BuzzFeed news in
one of the more awesome things we've
seen this year developer ala Beck o
merabh has ported counter-strike 1.6 to
Android it's a free download and you'll
need to get counter-strike 1.6 installed
from Steam in order to play it it seems
to work pretty well and it's even
compatible with game controllers if
you've been looking for a good shooter
on Android and don't mind tinkering a
little bit this is a fun little project
Coachella has teamed up with YouTube to
offer 360 degree live video streaming
for the entirety of the event of course
it's Sunday so by now you've missed most
of it but there's still time to check it
out before the festival officially ends
Sunday evening all you need to do is get
the YouTube application head to
Coachella's YouTube channel and get
started this of course comes on the
heels of YouTube's announcing 360 degree
live streaming video with spatial audio
app Annie came out with its quarter 1
numbers for the Google Play Store and
the Apple App Store as per the norm
Google Play had far more downloads while
Apple had far more revenue the same
things are true as they were before
including China being a huge source of
revenue for Apple Android users spending
less money per download and all of that
jazz the Hugh has government suggested
this week that Google and Apple should
censor encrypted applications on various
app stores so that we can't download
them unfortunately for the police this
situation is easily worked around by you
know sideloading the application and
continues to show how little the
government officials understand
technology don't worry this probably
isn't going to happen for even more
Android apps and games news releases and
updates don't forget to check out this
week's newsletter which is linked in the
video description below there you'll
find all the stuff we didn't have space
for here and if you'd like you can sign

Sunday alright folks let's take a look
at the apps and games that made a big
splash this week as usual if you want to
check out any of these apps or games you
can find those links in the video
description below
you may remember exploding kittens as
one of the most funded projects in
kickstarter history this game is
essentially a spin-off of the popular
cards against humanity' where you're
given a bunch of scenarios and then
you're given cards to try to make it as
ridiculous and funny as possible like
other games in this genre the humor can
be dirty and dark at times but those
with a healthy sense of humor should
enjoy it quite a bit it's a dollar
ninety-nine and has no in-app purchases
chippy has released their official
application on android here recently
with moderate success so far
much like the acclaimed website you can
browse for various chips based on
categories keywords and a variety of
other factors or you can just see what's
trending on any given day the
application functions and looks pretty
much just like the website so it should
be easy enough to figure out your way
around there are some really say bugs
here and there but nothing too serious
the latest Warhammer 40k was released
this week with fairly positive reviews
so far to put it simply this is a very
big game there are 170 campaign missions
with a full-blown storyline which is
steeped in action and chaos you'll be
able to customize your character create
new gear and upgrade just about
everything to keep things fresh the
developers also include daily challenges
so you can get even more gear it may be
one of the best freemium games released
this year it's true that we've talked
about chroma key board in the past but
it underwent such a huge change this
week that we felt like talking about it
again to keep up with the competition
crew my keyboard is now free with in-app
purchases so if you've been bulking
because of the price you don't have an
excuse anymore along with that came an
update that added a new settings
application for the keyboard new color
styles and new prediction algorithm and
preference syncing everyone that bought
the application before will get upgraded
to premium for free so go ahead and
check it out the harvest moon seeds of
Memories was announced last year and
fans of the series were really hoping
this wasn't going to be another freemium
ripoff of the series they loved much
like other studios were doing
unexpectedly this is actually a full
Harvest Moon game it fancies itself a
farm and life simulator where you must
grow crops May
friends perform tasks and take care of
your little digital life there are no
in-app purchases so you will get the
full game when you buy it it's a
pleasant little surprise and Harvest
Moon fans should definitely pick this up
