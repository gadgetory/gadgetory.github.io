royal authority now at Mobile World
Congress 2017 LG launched the LG G six
now there's lots of things we could say
about this phone but they all want to
look specifically at this 18 by 9 aspect
ratio in fact what is an aspect ratio it
is 18 by 9 why is knit 2 by 1 what
Charlie Chaplin got to do with it
well let me explain now one of the key
metrics about a smartphone is a screen
size and we might say all the Google
pixel has a 5-inch display all the while
AP 10 and a 5.1 inch display or the
galaxy note 5 has a 5.7 inch display now
what do we mean by five-inch 5.1 inch
5.7 inch well it's not the width or the
height of the screen
no what it actually is is a diagonal
from corner to corner in fact that's how
we measure televisions how we measure
monitors for computers and how we
measure smart phones so if we look at
the galaxy note 5 we'll think that
across here the display is two point
seven nine five inches and its height is
four point nine five inches now if we do
a bit of Pythagoras what you actually
find is that if you square the widths
and by the height and then take the
square root of it what you actually get
is five point seven inches now aspect
ratio have a lot to do with media with
films with movies so therefore we
measure it in landscape mode not in
portrait mode if we look again here at
the galaxy note 5 we find here we've got
four point nine six inches by two point
seven nine six inches now we divide
these two together you get the screen
ratio and I actually divided those two
together you get one point seven seven
now sixteen by nine is 16 divided by
nine which is in fact one point seven
seven seven seven seven seven seven
terms and recurring and so we can say
that the galaxy note 5 has a sixteen by
nine display in fact the majority of
smart phones have a 16 point
by nine display you don't actually
actually have to work out only by the
physical measurements you can also get
by the screen resolution if you assume
it every pixel is square then I HD
screen resolutions 1920 by 1080 if you
divide 1920 by 1080 you get what one
point seven seven seven seven seven
seven seven seven recurring which of
course is sixteen by nine now I've
mentioned sixteen by nine but you may
have also heard of four by three now way
back in the days of silent movies of
Hollywood people like Charlie Chaplin
Laurel and Hardy and Harold Lloyd were
all being filmed using 35 millimeter
film and each frame has got four
perforations on the film roll and when
you calculate that aspect ratio it gives
you four by three and that 4 by 3 ratio
stuck with us and became the kind of
standard for television and and further
on but from there we moved on into the
widescreen format now the widescreen
format for cinema is one point eight
five to one which is quite close to one
point seven seven to one which is the
sixteen by nine format that we find on
our phones and on media like blu-ray
because they're closing which is
actually quite easy to transfer
cinematic releases down to home video
releases it's not much of a difficult
transition there and then that brings us
to 18 by 9 now 18 by 9 is a course 2 by
1 which means that the screen on the LGG
6 is twice as wide as it is high now
they chose 18 by 9
rather than 2 by 1 because they felt LG
felt that it was closer to consumers
expectations of 16 by 9 18 by 9 they
sound very similar but just it shows you
that it's just that little bit wider now
at the moment most content is filmed as
I said in this cinema widescreen format
or we might get in our blu-ray format
widescreen 16 by 9 actually some content
is nowadays actually filmed in two by
one and it is using a film format called
you need is iam now films like Jurassic
world were filmed in the 2 by 1 ratio
and in fact a lot of programs on Netflix
and Netflix originals like house of cars
and stranger things also
filmed in this 2x1 aspect ratio now on
the lggs is if you watch a movie that's
prepared in 16 by 9 you will get
blackballed on the screen because there
isn't the content there to show however
LG has also included some app scaling
features that are allowing to play
around between the different aspect
ratios on your device it's also worth
noting the LG t6 actually narrower and
therefore easier to hold in the hand
than the LG g5 now the g5 had a 5.3 inch
display the GC has a 5.7 inch display
but because of that changing aspect
ratio it means that actually big jisuk
is narrowing the honey-bag is narrower
than the Google pixel XL is narrower
than the s7 edge and is narrower than
the note 5 so that could actually bring
us to a new age where we kind of come
into narrower foot taller phones now 5.7
is a fairly large display now
manufacturers could opt to go for maybe
five point five or even five point two
inch displays using the 18 by 9 aspect
ratio and we'll find they'll be much
easier to hold in the hand now when you
combine that with bezel as displays or
with curved displays we are maybe going
to come into a time now when we're going
to have more display regular straight
state occupying that front part of our
smartphones will 18 by 9 become the new
de facto standard will it's too early
just say at the moment but over the next
year or two we're going to see I'm
pretty sure lots of om experimenting to
the 18 by 9 format and if it's proves
popular amongst consumers we may find
this will become the new aspect ratio
not only for smartphones but also for
digital media and for home cinema and
maybe even we're going to start to see
it more in the normal cinema as well
exciting times we'll have to see what
happens well my name's Gary central
