gentlemen this is clean youngberg coming
at you from android authority calm the
number one website for all things
android today we've got our hands on a
pair of Samsung's brand new tech tiles
we've got a set here we're going to be
over viewing them doing an in-depth look
at the the functionality of the tectiles
showing you some of the stuff they can
do and then going over the tectiles app
that you install on your phone you want
to use these Sony's let's just get right
into that you can download the app from
the Play Store it's called Samsung tech
time with the Samsung tech tile app what
we can actually do is use the app to
program our NFC tags to perform specific
functions we can have them influence the
settings and apps of the phone and
change the phone settings launch an app
join a Wi-Fi network show a message via
the phone and text we can make a call
send a text message share contact or
start a google talk conversation we have
our social options where you can update
facebook status Facebook Like Tweet
estatus follow a Twitter user connect on
LinkedIn and we have location and web
settings where we can show an address or
location Foursquare check-in facebook
check in and open a web page alright so
let's program one of these tectiles I'm
going to go ahead and go into the change
phone settings I will select the Wi-Fi
and then the ringer volume then we have
further options we can choose to turn
the Wi-Fi on we can turn the ringer
volume up once we press next we have
confirmation that we need to hold the
phone over the tech tile to program it
via NFC so here is our tech tile and we
simply set the phone on there says it
failed to write the tech tile and then
it says tactile has been written so now
the Wi-Fi is on the ringer volume was
set to seven anyways let's try another
one we will go phone and text I'm going
to share a contact share the me contact
will go next now we can hover this
textile has been written now we will
exit the app once we're in the home
screen here we can even close the
tectiles program our phone has NFC
enabled and we will tap our tech tile
and here we go it brings up the contact
so go ahead and pick
up for yourself they're available at
local Samsung retailers and you can get
them online or you can just pick up
regular old NFC tags will do the same
thing but the SEC tiles are really cool
functionality I can see myself using
them for sure and anyways guys stay
tuned with android authority calm we got
the best company you and more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
