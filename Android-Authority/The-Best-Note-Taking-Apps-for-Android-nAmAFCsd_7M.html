Joe handy the Android authority app guy
do you like to take notes I know I do
and after the intro we'll show you the
best note-taking apps for Android first
on our list today is color note this
solid note-taking app is pretty much all
the features you can expect from a
note-taking app there are two main ways
to take notes you can take a regular
text note in a list note where you can
do lists you can change note colors if
you want to and the app itself is thema
Balazs well so if it's a customized
experience you're looking for there are
a few better than color notes there's
even a function to search notes based on
what color you've assigned them if
Evernote were a song it would be we are
the champions
that's because Evernote really is the
champion of note-taking apps for Android
if you're hardcore into taking notes and
literally want all the features then
look no further than Evernote it can't
be themed like some of these apps can
but if you're in it for the features
that isn't really a big deal you can
take text list speech and picture notes
upload them to the cloud and a whole
bunch of other things with Evernote this
is just the free stuff to you get even
more if you pay for it next on our list
is a pretty solid note-taking app called
free note this is more for the stylus
and handwriting crowd that it is for the
normal note-taker the whole life
revolves around handwritten notes so if
you're bad at writing with your fingers
like I am you may want to skip this for
something that uses the keyboard more my
terrible handwriting skills aside this
app is a lot of fun to use and people
seem to really like it you just start
writing what you want you can do it
letter by letter or word by word if you
choose people with larger phones like
the note 2 or tablets may find this more
convenient than trying to type with the
keyboard yes we have another video that
has Google keep in it there's a reason
for it and it's because this app is
still really awesome especially for
note-taking it has a simple interface
with easy to use features so you don't
have to waste a lot of time learning how
this app works you can take regular text
notes list notes picture notes and voice
notes the voice notes are also
integrated with Google Voice Search so
you can take a note straight from there
you can also view and add notes online
at drive.google.com backslash keep in
terms of simplicity none can really beat
Google key next up is a solid
note-taking app called note to
everything this note-taking app is the
first one that's based around folders so
you can organize your
to your liking while a couple of apps do
this via the color options some people
prefer folders you can take the usual
text notes you can also do draw notes
for you stylus fans voice notes barcode
notes and there's even an add-on that
takes notes for Google Docs so if you
want to get something with a few more
features and a different style for
storing notes this could be up your
alley
last on our list today is some note this
solid note taking application is all
about the folders much more so than the
last one you can create colored folders
for whatever your heart desires and this
can help keep you avid note-takers much
more organized it's also pretty simple
to use in terms of the notes themselves
you really have two simple options you
can take a regular text note or a
regular text note with an attachment
that can be pretty much any kind of file
so well it doesn't have a lot of
individual options a little creativity
means you can take pretty much any kind
of note that you want you can take a
look at our leader board you can see how
these note-taking apps stack up against
one another keep in mind that this is
not our personal ratings this is how
they were rated in the Google Play Store
so this is how you the people voted for
them there is no bias on our part if
you'd like to check out any of these
apps we've added the links for them
below really though it's about finding
the best note-taking app for you so if
there's a good one that we forgot feel
free to let us know in the comments once
again i'm joe hindi the android
authority app guy feel free to subscribe

social media links in the video
