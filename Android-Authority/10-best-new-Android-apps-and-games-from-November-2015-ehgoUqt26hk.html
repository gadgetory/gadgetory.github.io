handy the Android authority app guy and
it's about time we've rounded up the
best new apps and games from November of
2015
ok folks we did things a little bit
differently this month we now have two
lists and they are the best new Android
apps and the best new Android games if
you want to see one list or the other
we'll have both of those linked in the
video description below but for the time
being we're going to cover both lists
with one video and I hope all of you
enjoy it so let's get started
Apple music was released to a very mild
reception on Android a lot of people
late on the Apple hey twitch is starting
to be the norm on Apple apps to get
released on Android but the service
itself isn't half bad it boasts 30
million songs curated playlists and
various radio stations for $9.99 per
month the application itself could use
some work though and it does contain
some bug's lag and other minor issues
it's worth a shot
and we hope Apple fixes those other
issues sooner or later
Call of Champions is a new MOBA that was
released earlier this month as with most
MOBAs you collect a party and then storm
up onto the battlefield to defend your
side and take over your opponents it
features pretty decent graphics and it
seems to work rather well in terms of
online play there are a total of 15
heroes to gather all of which with their
own special abilities it's free to
download and play with in-app purchases
being only for extra content Dead Effect
2 is the sequel to the popular Dead
Effect game that helped to find what a
shooter should look like on Android in
this new sci-fi shooter you're tasked
with killing all sorts of bad guys and
monsters
there is also an RPG element that lets
you level up your character and make it
stronger
the graphics are quite impressive and
the controls are about as good as you
can get on a touchscreen it's free to
download so you can give it a shot right
now
ok fallout pip-boy isn't necessarily a
game but it is probably the best
companion application to a game we've
seen in a very long time it launched
alongside fallout 4 and gives you the
ability to monitor your character from
your smartphone or tablets you can see
things like stats inventory map and
there is even a few minigames that you
can engage with the reviews are almost
universally positive and we agreed that
it's pretty great
the latest odd world game to hit Android
as much as Odyssey it's true that this
isn't necessarily a brand new story from
the series but that doesn't mean it
isn't a lot of fun for those who haven't
played this title as an action adventure
game where you must reclaim the
package of gab er it hasn't received a
ton of press so it's still a little
obscure but the user reviews have been
really good so far
pin tasking is a unique application that
allows you to keep open applications in
a floating button that means they're
always there sitting on the side of the
screen waiting for you to open them and
engage with them once again this is a
great application for power users and
you can try it before you buy it
although the application limits you to
two floating icons for the purposes of
demoing the app the full version costs 3
dollars and 99 cents
pool is an application from mediafire
which you may know as the cloud storage
and file sharing service you've probably
downloaded stuff from before pool is a
kind of hybrid mix between google photos
and Instagram and that allows you to
upload in-store photos but you can also
share them directly with people it's
quicker and easier than sharing
individual photos over text messages and
unlike Instagram you only share it with
people you want to share it with signal
private messenger is a newer messaging
service that gained a lot of steam very
quickly after Edward Snowden publicly
endorsed the application it boasts
immense amounts of security and helps
you keep your messages encrypted and
private only for your eyes it's
accompanied by a very basic functional
material design interface and it's
entirely open source for those who like
to see what the app code looks like it's
quite good and worth a shot
this war of mine is a survival game
based around world war 2 the main
difference between this one and others
is that you have to survive being
innocent civilians stuck in the middle
of two warring sides each decision you
make determines who lives and dies and
whether or not your group survives it's
surprisingly deep and emotional for a
mobile game and probably among the best
tiles released this year Google released
YouTube music as an offshoot to the
original YouTube application this one
carries a number of music centric
features including featured playlists
and you'll only find music videos when
you search for content the free version
of the application is fairly competent
but if you pick up a YouTube red
subscription you'll also get offline
videos the ability to play music without
loading the video and of course add free
videos once again I'm Joe Indy the
Android authority app guy why you're
here why not subscribe to the Android
Authority YouTube channel if you're
hanging out for a minute we have a
couple of awesome videos for you to
watch right over there and they're also
linked in the video description below
for you folks on mobile finally don't
freak out not one but two written
companions both of which are linked in
the video description below as always
thanks for watching everybody and have a
wonderful day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
