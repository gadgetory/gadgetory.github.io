the road for the one plus one in the 15
months that it was on the market we had
one of the best devices at an affordable
price point and it certainly made a name
for the company 1 plus but now we have
the dawning of a new one plus two and
though we just took a look at how the
1+1 fares right now now we want to take
a look at the five things that we
definitely want to see from the brand
new one plus smartphone flagship it's
josh to regard from android authority
what's going on everybody and this is a
look at five things we want to see from
the 1+2 now it's important to note right
now that we already have a bunch of
rumors and even some confirm
specifications and information on the
oneplus 2 and you can see all of those
in another video and on a post at Andrew
30.com so a couple of the things you're
hearing in this video of the five things
we want to see from the 1+2 might
already have been said before but still
here are the five things we want to see
we'll start off with one that's really
obvious availability now the oneplus one
had an invite system that might be
considered the butt of some jokes for a
number of people especially when the
word 1 plus comes into conversation but
the reason for that is because a lot of
people pined over the one plus one and
availability just didn't meet the demand
now while it might have been a very good
move for 1 plus to create an invite
system to cover the supposed demand what
they didn't count for was the fact that
it was in such high demand and he just
didn't have enough devices to send out
this year however we're going to have a
one plus two with a different invite
system now what we've been told is that
they're going to be thirty to fifty
percent more devices available so that
the demand can be met but with the buzz
that the oneplus one was able to create
in the last year or so the 1+2 might
just have even higher demand and
hopefully one plus we'll be able to
cover all of that couple that with the
fact that if the one plus two is
available in even more markets than it
just might be the flagship killer that
has always setting out to be but what
about when we get the devices in our
hands well that's when we start off with
design when it comes to design the
oneplus one did one thing really well it
differentiated its look and it's feel
from other devices in the market and
that's a pretty good move already but we
would love to see even more to make the
oneplus to differentiate itself in terms
of design and even then in terms of size
we already saw a leak that perhaps the
one plus two is going
be a little bit smaller in footprint
overall then the one plus one hopefully
the screen is still about the same size
but if the footprint is even smaller
than that makes handling even better and
that's always a plus for us the one plus
one though did have style swap covers if
you wanted to change the look of your
device and in my case I did get the
bamboo style swap cover unfortunately
the entire style swab line was nixed
mostly because of quality assurance
issues which we'll get into even more a
little bit later but luckily the people
over at one plus have already said that
they realize what the pitfalls were
behind the style swap program and they
will have more available for the 1+2 all
of which will be able to work without
any instances of people saying that it's
not working for them but now we get
underneath the surface and we talk about
software software on the oneplus one was
created by cyanogen but unfortunately
the relationship between one plus and
sand region really broke down in the
span of the one plus one's lifetime and
because of that one plus had to create
their own operating system and also
create one that would be available for
the 1+2 at its launch and that was
called oxygen OS now at version 1 point
0 for the oneplus one it is based on an
earlier version of lollipop version 5.0
point2 and unfortunately that was only
the start of the problems with oxygen OS
installation on the one plus ended up
being a little bit cumbersome and if you
already had sandwich and 11s on there
you would update 2 12's so a lot of
users just felt like they could keep it
already but now with oxygen OS we have a
much more bare-bones version of Android
about as stock as it could possibly get
with only a few 1 plus centric features
that are baked in hopefully the one plus
2's oxygen OS is going to have even more
features baked in that will allow it to
differentiate itself from the rest of
the software available in the market now
especially stock Android because if it
just feels way too vanilla then that's
just not really the way 1 plus should be
doing it if there's one thing we always
look at when it comes to a new device
it's the camera and if the 1+2 can
deliver a camera experience that is at
the very least on par with the LG g4 in
the samsung galaxy s6 as examples then
we would probably give it some really
high marks the camera on the 1+2
hopefully is going to have at the very
least optical image stabilization to
help it in the situations where the
oneplus one just wasn't able to get off
a pretty shot and that was mostly in
situations where you had less than ideal
lie
otherwise the 1+1 camera was mostly all
right especially for its time but now we
are in 2015 a year that we've seen a lot
of smartphones especially the high-end
ones really bang out some awesome camera
experiences and if the 1+2 is to really
put itself among the best flagships out
there this is where it has to deliver
which brings us to the final thing we
really want to see from the oneplus 2
and that's better qat qat meaning
quality assurance if there's one thing
that we really publicized on android
authority and it was found across the
interwebs was that when the oneplus one
was being sent out to a lot of users as
the invite system was finally rolling
out devices a lot of people opened up
their boxes only to find problems with
their devices they would turn on the
phone have tint issues on the screen
have some touchscreen issues and even
some quality assurance on the actual
build themselves of their phones was
just sort of off so quality assurance is
probably one of the biggest things that
one plus needs to fix for the 1+2
especially if their demand is going to
be even more than the one plus one and a
lot more devices are going to be making
it into users hands especially since the
Snapdragon 810 is going to be what
powers of one plus two it's definitely
on the company to make sure that the
problems that have been publicized about
the 810 mainly overheating issues are
not going to be problems that their
users end up having with their new
flagship smartphone there also some
instances and reports of customer
service being not so responsive when it
comes to 1+1 issues so if one plus can
be quick and helpful with one plus two
issues and they probably will have an
overall experience that is the one to
beat for their one plus two so everybody
thank you so much for watching and I
hope you enjoyed this video looking at
the five things that we're waiting for
in the 1+2 we are literally just about
even 48 hours away from the launch of
the oneplus 2 and I will have that phone
in my hand and bring you all of the
great coverage of it in our first looks
and some quick versus quick looks as
well we know that there are some
features that were already being leaked
and probably even reported on by 1 plus
themselves like the fingerprint scanner
and whatnot but really what we're
looking for in the one plus two is just
an experience that has made even better
from the one that we had in the oneplus
one and we want the essentials good
camera performance and the build quality
that we are hoping will have some nice
changes in its aesthetic and also a
little bit of unique customization as
well the software is also a big point of
contention for us we hope oxygen OS
is better from the original one point 0
version that they released for the 1+1
so keep it tuned here for all of the
coverage of the oneplus 2 and we hope
that you keep it tuned here so remember
to subscribe to our channel if you
haven't already so you can keep up with
all of that and then look at all of the
content from my friends and android also
take a look at our 1+1 now video so you
can see how the 1+1 fares now compared
to the flagships that we have coming out
here in 2015 before the oneplus 2 and
then finally listened to the android or
d podcast every single week and head on
over to Andrew 30.com and our forums
