Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly we
have headlines and new releases let's
talk about it first up this week Google
is introducing two new ways for
developers to beta test applications the
first is an open beta where all you need
is the link while the other allows users
to sign up using their email addresses
prepare for far more betas to hit the
google play store in the future last
november microsoft released a visual
studio emulator for android the only
problem with it was that developers had
to use visual studio in order to develop
applications and use the emulator now
developers can use android studio or
eclipse and still use the visual studio
emulator and with that life was good
again in one of the bigger headlines
this week Google announced that they'll
be eliminating the need to sign into
google plus 2 comments on youtube this
paired with the news that Google+ will
be removed from other services has
kick-started yet another round of rumor
mill nonsense that Google+ is shutting
down relax everybody it's probably not
but Thesz de announced fallout shelter
back at e3 earlier this year and said it
was coming to Android but not
specifically when we now know that the
official release date is August
thirteenth that's about two weeks away
folks so get your thumbs ready Microsoft
is developing an Android launcher called
an arrow launcher it's in private beta
right now and you can finally download
link in the video description below it's
a little light on customization features
but an overall strong effort that
actually feels like something that was
made for Android we expect it to do
quite well overall for even more Android
apps and games news updates and releases
don't forget to check out this week's
newsletter which is linked in the video
description below there you'll find all
the content that we didn't have time for
here today if you're so inclined you can
also sign up using your email address
and have this info sent straight to your
email address every single Friday in
addition we do now have a twitch channel
we usually stream on sundays mondays and
tuesdays at five p.m. eastern standard
time however this week I had to send
back my Nvidia shield tablet thanks to
that recall so I won't have my streaming
device still you should go subscribe and
then you'll be ready when we get back
online okay folks to take a look at the
new releases that made a big splash this
week as usual if you want to check any
of these applications out you can find
the links in the video description below
Rovio has released the actual sequel to
the original angry birds game this last
week it's called angry birds too and it
actually does improve on the original
Angry Birds experience it
with multi stage level spells and even
boss levels which is sure to bring some
much-needed freshness to the aging
franchise there is also a multiplayer
experience with tournaments that you can
compete in it's kid-friendly and
free-to-play box calendar is a new
calendar application that comes from the
same people who brought us box or email
it has quite a few features to choose
from including theming and customization
various calendar views material design
and support for exchange and Google
Calendar the unique feature is the
ability to send your availability to
other people at a moment's notice to
help plan for events and get-togethers
there are some release date bugs so do
keep an eye out for that a day in the
woods is a hybrid puzzle game and board
game with fairly decent graphics for a
genre the premise is simple you must
guide the girl to Grandma's house while
avoiding all the things that don't want
you to get there you actually play as a
wisp that controls the field which can
be customized by unlocking various
things there are also 60 levels seasonal
backdrops and the game has no in-app
purchases it's a fun little title aim
worth checking out five nights at
Freddy's 4 was released on the google
play store this weekend marks the second
fnaf release this year this one takes
place in a bedroom where you must check
the bed behind you the closet and two
doors in order to keep the bad guys at
bay the game is rather short but very
challenging we even stream this one on
Twitch it's only a few bucks and there
are no in-app purchases if you like
shock value you'll probably like this
virtually everyone who has heard of
benchmarks knows about 3dmark it's the
benchmark software that all the pros use
and now it's on Android this will push
your device to its limit to see how good
it is for gaming and also compare it to
other Android iOS and Windows devices
it's totally free with no in-app
purchases and no advertising which means
most of you who have already left to go
download it and now I'm talking to
