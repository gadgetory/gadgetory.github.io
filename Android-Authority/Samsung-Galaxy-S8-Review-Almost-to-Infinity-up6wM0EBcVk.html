evolution of the Galaxy S line that
tries to pack a big screen experience
onto a body that doesn't feel like such
and it's also in a package that you
might argue tries to do a little bit too
much it's Joshua Vergara what's going on
everybody and let's change this up for a
second
there that's better
this is a samsung galaxy s 8 there are
two sizes of the galaxy s 8 this time
around as there is now also an S 8 plus
there's no longer the word edge in the
name that is because this display is now
called the infinity display and it's
less about the feature set of this
screen and more about how it tries to
defy logic
Samsung has stretched the display out as
much as it possibly could on these
bodies so that they even did away with
the tactile home button and the Samsung
branding at the top the result is a
display that is almost all screen all
the time and makes the bezels at the top
and bottom as minimal as possible also
on the sides you get the edge display
back where it bleeds down to the sides
so that it comes down to meet the hand
and it makes handling a breeze but all
of these changes mean that a five point
eight inch display for the s8 is what
you're getting on the phone that
definitely doesn't feel like that
especially when you think back to larger
display devices over the last year or
two of course if you want even more
screen real estate there is the si+ that
has 6.2 inches in its display and it's
just a little bit harder to maneuver in
one hand so just kind of bear that in
mind our main gripe with the s8 plus is
the location of the fingerprint reader
mostly because they have moved it from
the front to the back next to the camera
and it's really hard to reach for it
especially if you're just using one hand
on the si plus even with the regular si
we felt like we had to use two hands
just to unlock the device when using
fingerprints
indeed the infinity display is the
crowning achievement of the s8 line the
main reason being because it is the most
screen that you're going to get in a
body that most people can use no one has
to really gripe over a big phone anymore
when Samsung has proven that in this era
we have to kind of reach
what a big phone or a big screen
actually means that and all of that real
estate adds to what you would expect
from a Samsung high-end display a Super
AMOLED display that comes in a quad HD
resolution and has a bunch of different
features like the edge UX and the
always-on display it even punches colors
harder than before mostly because this
is one of the first displays to be HD
already when you go into video
applications like YouTube you will
notice that this display gets brighter
and its colors get more saturated and
it's something you do notice going in
and out of the application that we will
admit it doesn't seem to have changed
the battery life all that much however
there is a small thing to keep in mind
with new aspect ratio screens like this
when looking at a video like you're
looking at me right now there is going
to be something called pillarboxing
where there are black bars to the sides
rather than the usual black bars on the
top and bottom that you might be used to
with other phones now the phone does
give you an option just a small button
to be able to make the video or even the
application full screen but you might
lose a little bit at the top and bottom
of your video and in gaming you might
scrunch up some of the elements or even
just have some elements bleed off of the
screen now this isn't that big of a deal
it's just something to get used to and
while most applications will already be
in full screen mode when you do them up
sometimes you'll get an application that
has to have the black bars on the top
and bottom which can be a little bit odd
and again we mentioned that there's no
more tactile home button which means
soft keys and the nice thing about
Samsung's iteration of these soft keys
is that they put their own flair on them
while adding customization the nav bar
can be customized with even its own
background color and it can be switched
around you can't add any buttons to it
but you can at least put the back button
on the other side if you're more used to
that orientation and there is a home
button on this phone it's just
underneath the display there is a
pressure-sensitive area around where the
home button would be that you can press
a little bit harder on and you'll feel a
vibration that does the same thing as
pressing home the classic Samsung method
of unlocking the device is still here as
you can use that home button to turn on
the device and then start unlocking the
phone over all the ease of use in
handling a large display like this is
kind of the perfect trade-off for losing
the home button we're fine Minh has been
the name of the game here as even the
camera bump has been minimized to make
the back virtually flat and though there
are other colors to choose from this
black on black is definitely one of the
silly
devices we have used as far as this is
the latest Samsung flagship
specifications are exactly where you
would expect them to be depending on
your market the latest 10 nanometer XE
knows chip set or the Snapdragon 835
power all that the Galaxy sa can do
backed by four gigabytes of RAM and 64
gigabytes of on-board storage that can
be bolstered with a micro SD card now
one thing we should mention is that we
have the s8 for the majority of our time
testing and we only have the s8 plus for
a little bit of time our review today is
focusing on the SAS experience with that
said the time we have spent with the
Galaxy s8 has shown us no issues with
performance going in and out of
applications even when it comes to
gaming we played a lot of Super Mario
run and personally I played Jade Empire
2 pretty heavy mobile games and had no
issues whatsoever there are virtually no
connections missing in the hardware
stack and to keep the phone as secure as
possible there are a ton of options for
unlocking the device and keeping it
secure since there's no home button the
fingerprint reader as we said has been
moved to the back doubling up with the
heart rate sensor right next to the
camera optics it's not an ideal location
like we already said but since it is in
that location you probably will be using
other methods like the iris scanner your
mileage or consistency with the iris
scanner might vary however while I
didn't have any problem unlocking the
device at any time even with glasses on
Narad one of our editors had a little
bit more trouble when he did the main
hardware Edition is Samsung decks a doc
that allows the Galaxy S a to become a
computer of sorts giving you a full
desktop experience on a monitor that is
hooked up to decks now we've done a
little bit of testing on it already and
we can say that there's a lack of
applications and there's still some
visual latency so it's not necessarily
the smoothest experience a full review
will be coming later this week the s8
NDS A+ have 3,000 and 3,500 milliamp
hour units respectively and fast
charging or even wireless charging are
all available for topping the batteries
up I was actually able to get five hours
of screen on time during 18 hour work
days on a few occasions however most of
the time I was actually at three and a
half to four hours of screen on time for
the same amount of work thankfully a
combination of the Super AMOLED display
and a lot of different power saving
features can definitely stretch out the
battery life again your mileage might
vary but there are plenty of ways for
you to eke out just what you need so
that you don't have to go searching for
a cable all the time
and right next to the USB type-c port is
the headphone jack which Samsung has not
given up just yet opposite that is the
loudspeaker which is decent at best
audio through the headphone jack is
actually quite good considering that
there's no third party deck or even an
amp in here and there are a ton of
different options that Samsung puts in
so you can cater the sound to just your
liking
does even the adapt sound which returns
from the note 7 which gives you a bunch
of beeps so that it can get a sound
profile that fits you the best
Samsung has proven that they are able to
stretch out their first party DAC as
much as possible but I really do think
that an Anna would have been be cherry
on top here that said Samsung did go a
slightly different route and instead
enhance the headphones that come with
this phone they are tuned by AKG and to
be honest they sound pretty incredible
that phones are also good for phone
calls as the inline controls include a
microphone and the audio quality turned
out pretty good speaking of phone calls
we didn't have any problems with
connections on the t-mobile network on
either the SA or the SI plus no dropped
calls and mobile data with as fast as it
should be especially on all of our
unlimited networks we move from audio to
visual as we take on the camera a 12
megapixel shooter with the big focus
pixels returns on the main shooter
allowing for very fast autofocus while
the front-facing camera has been bumped
up to 8 megapixels and has what is
called a smart autofocus system out of
focus is not something you usually see
on front-facing camera so it's nice to
find it here that said the selfies do
benefit from higher megapixel counts and
it does a pretty good job in most
lighting situations in low-light the
pictures obviously lose their sharpness
as the shutter speed requires a little
bit more time to properly expose the
picture so while there might not be
video stabilization on the front-facing
camera which is not that big of a
surprise the one thing that I do love
about the front-facing camera on the
Galaxy S a is that it can record 2k
resolution video which will be really
great for vloggers like myself which
takes us to the main camera which mostly
doesn't change from last generation the
interface is about the same as before
prioritizing swipes and certain gestures
to keep shooting as easy and one-handed
as possible and here's a video sample of
me recording at 4k UHD resolution and
you can see that the video still looks
pretty great there aren't any other mode
that are included in the camera
interface this time around so not a
whole lot has really changed but you can
record 1080p resolution video at 60
frames per second so that's one of the
main additions and when it comes to the
video side of things
Samsung touts that there is a multi
frame processing involved here where the
camera takes multiple shots of the same
image and puts them all together to get
the most detail and color out of the
scene now this is something that we did
try to test out against the s7 edge and
we found that while there is a small
upgrade in terms of its quality it's not
going to be so much that most average
users will really feel the change so the
quality and the experience are largely
similar to the note 7 and the s7
providing enjoyable photos and video in
all but the darkest of conditions
focusing is really speedy as we
mentioned already and there's always the
selective focus mode if you want an
option that has a little bit more
flexibility so we can finally talk about
the software experience and we're going
to talk about big speed Samsung's assist
in that is going to be built into the
Galaxy s8 line now unfortunately Bigsby
will not have all of its features
available for most users out of the box
you're going to have to wait for a
software update and because of that we
kind of think that big speed is a bit of
a half-baked feature especially right
now but we do have high hopes that it's
going to turn into a killer app for the
Galaxy s8 but with that said let's talk
about what the phone actually does
provide since we just talked about the
camera we can talk about big speed
vision essentially this is a scanning
layer that's built into the camera
software that allows you to scan not
only text but also items and even wine
no matter where you are you'll be able
to get information on a myriad of
different things the biggest issue right
now with big ste vision is that it is
hit or miss right now the shopping
apparatus is still relying on Amazon and
even then it's not really able to pull
information for a lot of items that I
tried to scan the text portion was also
pretty inconsistent as certain business
cards were not scanned properly and I
had to do multiple tries just to get it
right and add that person to my contacts
currently the best usage for bigsby
vision is for wine at his local market I
was able to scan a bunch of different
bottles of wine and for about 80% of
them I was able to get all the
information I needed from Vivino
which leads us to another portion of the
Bigsby assistant and that is Bigsby home
really the only other portion of Bigsby
that is actually kind of
ready for market now Bigsby home is
essentially like Google now in that you
can have it as a home screen if you
swipe all the way to the left but
there's also a brand new button on the
side
the Bigsby button that allows you to
launch it right away a simple click of
that button will bring you to Bigsby
home where you'll get a number of
different contextual cards that include
things like your most recent gallery
images or your next appointment using
the calendar application or reminders
that you can set using a built in
reminders application that is actually
pretty good
using the reminders application you can
hit share on pretty much any item in the
phone and you can make it a reminder
that will then show up in the Bixby home
area overall it's the main part of the
Bigsby experience that we actually enjoy
because it actually has all of its
features working properly as long as you
use the built-in Samsung applications
then you'll be able to get all that
contextual information third-party
application should be supported in the
future but as of right now you'll have
to use Samsung's own applications to get
the most out of Bixby home as I said
already we're going to have a follow-up
review in order for us to really show
you what Bigsby can do once it's voice
capabilities have been added onto it and
it's scanning capabilities have been
further updated and are more consistent
but overall the software of the Samsung
Galaxy s8 really shows how samsung has
been trying to pare back its interface
essentially you're not getting tutorials
all over the place and it's not
incessantly trying to make you
understand its features rather if you
dig into the settings and find all of
the different options you can then do
your homework or your due diligence and
just learn the ins and outs of this
phone
indeed Samsung's version of Android
NuGet turns out to be one of the
better-looking ones and also one of the
heaviest of this feature set but that's
something that we've already expected
coming from a Samsung Galaxy device but
that's where one of the issues come in
because the experience of the Samsung
Galaxy sa is one that feels very
familiar because Samsung has been
working really hard to give you their
version of services that we kind of have
already Bigsby oh is of course an
assistant that you can use alongside or
even on top of the already included
Google assistant you also have the
ability to use Samsung pay once it gets
updated to support the s8 but you can
always download Android pay as well if
there's anything that the Galaxy S a
kind of proves to us it's that it's
trying to do everything at once even if
it feels redundant at times
that's not necessarily a huge negative
to the Galaxy s8 however because users
with this great screen and the wonderful
handling for a big screen will have all
of the choices in front of them so they
can really cater the experience to what
they want the Samsung Galaxy sa and the
sa plus will be made available across
all major networks for the prices that
you would expect for a premium flagship
but the SI plus is going to cost you a
pretty penny more especially considering
its larger display and it's a larger
battery which are actually the only two
differences between the two especially
since big speeds not going to be fully
available until later on in the SH
lifespan as of right now it's a
wholeheartedly recommended device mostly
because most people want a big screen
phone and they're getting it here in one
of the easiest to handle packages from
there however the Samsung Galaxy sa does
everything you would expect it to and
it's going to be one of the most
reliable phones in the coming year and
probably even beyond so with that in
mind we do give it very high marks but
we don't think it's the absolute best
phone out there at least not yet keep it
tuned to android authority for all of
the best including more coverage about
