Android Authority and Samsung just
announced a larger version of this 6h
but is there anything else that makes
this phone different from its smaller
brother than just the sheer size well
that's what we're about to find out in
this quick comparison of the s6 edge+
versus the s6 edge when it comes to the
design both devices sport an identical
design language save for the obvious
fact that the s6 edge+ is the bigger of
the two
courtesy of its larger 5.7 inch display
compared to the 5.1 inch screen on the
s6 edge this means that the bigger
sibling retains the build quality those
first introduced with the s6 and s6 edge
featuring a sleek glass and metal
unibody design all these signature
Samsung elements are found with both
including the signature home button up
front integrated with a fingerprint
scanner the volume rocker and power
button to the left and right
respectively and the heart rate monitor
on the back next to the camera and the
headphone jack micro USB port and single
speaker on the bottom of course the big
story with both of these devices are the
curved edges along the display that
curve into the metal frame while allowed
for a unique look with the s6 edge
functionally it was somewhat limited but
that is set to change with the s6 edge+
which should make it a more compelling
feature instead of just being
aesthetically pleasing as far as the
handling experience is concerned the
much larger s6 edge+ obviously doesn't
allow for one-handed use as easily as
the s6 edge but it is easier to hold on
to giving it's slightly thicker profile
the similarities continue here with both
devices packing Super AMOLED displays
with quad HD resolutions the larger 5.7
inch screen results in a slightly lower
pixel density when compared to the 5.1
inch screen of the s6 edge but with both
PPI as well over 500 you aren't going to
notice a difference both displays offer
everything we love about Samsung screens
from deep blacks and saturated colors
that pop to great viewing angles and
high brightness there won't be any
complaints with either display but those
of you who love to watch videos play
games or simply just browse the web will
certainly appreciate the additional
display real estate available
with the Plus both feature very similar
processing packages with their octa-core
exynos processors with the edge+ coming
with an additional gig of ram
performance was very impressive with the
s6 edge and that should hopefully
continue with its larger sibling which
might be even better with its 4
gigabytes of ram and the short time we
spent with the device everything looked
as smooth and fluid as expected
while the s6 edge was available in 32 64
and 128 gigabyte versions the edge plus
comes with just the first two 32 and 64
gigabytes no expandable storage is
available with either leaving power
users dependent on getting the higher
storage versions and paying the premium
that is associated with it additional
hardware with both devices include the
fingerprint scanner integrated into the
home button with both being of the touch
type variety which is much faster and
more accurate than Samsung sold swipe
method on the battery front the s6 edge+
packs a larger 3000 milliamp hour
battery compared to the 2600 milliamp
hour unit of the s6 edge the battery
life of the s6 edge proved to be just
about average and that might also be the
case with the edge plus despite its
larger battery because of the larger
display it has the power but of course
we can't make any judgments until more
thorough testing is done while the
batteries are not replaceable both
devices also come with fast charging
capabilities and are also compatible
with both standards of wireless charging
the s6 edge+ comes with the same camera
setup as the s6 edge with its 16
megapixel rear camera with an aperture
of f11 and optical image stabilization
as well as a 5 megapixel wide-angle lens
on the front the cameras of the s6 and
the s6 edge are widely considered some
of the best in the smartphone world
right now and that continues to be the
case this time around
also and we can't wait to put this
camera through its paces the s6 edge+ is
running TouchWiz on top of 5.1.1
lollipop while the s6 edge is currently
on 5.0 point 2 but the experience is for
the most part pretty much the same with
the more rounded off squared icons on
the s6 edge+ being the only notable
difference in aesthetics this tone down
version of TouchWiz is one of the
reasons for the smooth performance on
Samsung's current flagships and while
the
is very little bloatware Samsung did
implement a few features to take
advantage of the edge glass like people
edge information stream edge lighting
and night clock but on the s6 edge+
Samsung took things a little further by
allowing user-defined applications to be
added to the People edge and the People
edge handle can now be relocated to
anywhere along the left and right edge
to make it easier to reach because of
the larger screen on the edge plus
samsung also added a triple tap of the
home button to shrink the screen to a
smaller size for easier one-handed use
something that isn't quite so necessary
on the smaller s6 edge outside of a few
software tweaks and the physical size
difference the s6 edge+ and the s6 edge
are practically the same device so it's
really going to come down to if you want
a larger screen or a phone that's easier
to use in one hand either way you can't
go wrong but this has been a quick
comparison of the s6 edge+
in the s6 edge keep it tuned here to
Android authority for more coverage of
the s6 edge note 5 and everything else
we have coming down the pipe because we
