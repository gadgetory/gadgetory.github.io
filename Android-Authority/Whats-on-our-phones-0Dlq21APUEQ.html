is Kevin the tech ninja and today we are
fulfilling a video request now wish I
could say who requested this video but
this is one of those videos that is gets
requested by a lot of people no matter
what video were actually working on
there's always a guy in the comment that
says hey what's on your phone what's
your favorite app so today here at
Android Authority we are going to go
over our favorite applications with
Android authority what's on our phones
for me when it comes to my Android I
really like to keep it simple my
launcher is KK launcher which to me
emulates the Google now launcher the
best I usually have a static wallpaper
but right now I'm using minimal
wallpaper which is gorgeous it's a huge
set of wallpapers that are animated and
doesn't tax the system or battery at all
you can also customize your own I'm
using Belle UI I can't pack my favorite
app I use is t9 app dialer this brings
up an app launcher so you can dial in
your applications it makes launching
whatever application I want to breeze
it's the app I install as soon as I get
a new phone or a flash in Iran
on my home screen I like to keep the
Google now widget also keep played music
widget for a random song the next screen
I have just a big calendar so I can stay
on top of my test throughout the day and
just a few additional apps that I like
to use check that me which is now
renamed to MIT bills it keeps track of
your bills that lets you play them via
the application bacon reader reddit
application tap path and link bubble
they both change the way I use Android
and if you need more information on
those two apps Joe Hindi did a bang-up
job on those and the link is down below
this is Kevin the tech ninja and that is
what's on my phone alright so here is my
daily driver this is the Moto X 2014 and
the reason why this is my daily driver
is because this is the phone that I
always go back to when I'm not reviewing
another phone which is pretty rare but
during the off chance that I am not
reviewing one like if I'm reviewing a
tablet or a SmartWatch or something this
is the phone that I will normally use
now as far as the apps go you can see I
keep my home screens pretty
simple I only have two of them so I have
four folders down here and then I have
seven icons in ladakh including the app
drawer and up top is dashclock which is
a pretty pretty popular widget so I
really like that widget it's nice and
clean and then on my second home screen
here this is simple calendar widget and
below it is high in the sky that is my
weather app of choice just because I'm
used to it I like the way that it looks
and I like the customization behind it
so I really like that app so let's go
ahead and just go into these folders
here these are my most commonly used
apps obviously which is why I have them
folders but the first folder is pretty
self-explanatory this is just the Google
folder with button with with just a
bunch of Google apps that I use on a
daily basis
second folder is the social folder so
Facebook Twitter Instagram snapchat
which I actually don't really use all
that often XDA for browsing XDA forums
and feedly for catching up on my tech
news and folder number three is my tools
folder so I have the calculator the
Android wear app moto Connect which is
for the Moto 360 PayPal and this is the
default Motorola app for the Moto X for
controlling motive display moto voice
and all that stuff asana which is a task
app that we use here at Android
authority to keep track of all our
different tasks that we have to do lone
assist this is for paying off my student
loans slack this is how we communicate
with each other here at Android
authority is through this app here and
these two apps down at the bottom are
Android wear apps so watch maker and
wear face
collection I think it's called and the
last folder I call it the favorites
folder but it's basically just any games
that I'm currently playing and also any
photo related apps so I have xej and the
gallery obviously and Zedd used to say
is just a wallpaper app and this is the
app that I use whenever I want to
download any wallpapers for my phone and
all the wallpapers are really
high-quality but that is pretty much it
that is all the apps I use on a daily
basis but I'll go ahead and swipe
through my app drawer just so you can
see some of the other apps that I have
in here not all of these apps I actually
some of these apps I actually don't
really even use I just still have them
so but you can see everything that I
have in here I try to keep my apps to a
minimum I don't like to install way too
many things and just kind of get carried
away with a bunch of stuff that I'll
probably never use so but that's pretty
much it as far as my apps go and but
yeah hopefully you guys found something
in here that might interest you and but
yeah that's it the Moto X 2014 is my
daily driver and those have been the
apps that I use on a daily basis ok hey
guys a Joe handy here and this is my
Galaxy Note 3 this has been my daily
driver since late 2013 I haven't
upgraded it in a long time because you
know as you can see you know it doesn't
really like very much and I really don't
have a need to upgrade it at all so I've
been keeping it around and you know I
know it's supposed to get lollipop here
very soon and that's always really
exciting on my home screen I have you
know basic stuff email a visual
voicemail placed or my messages and all
that stuff so you know nothing really
special nothing really unique I do have
the flashlight there just in case I need
it
over here I keep all of my social media
stuff all the utility stuff that I use
because you know I like having that all
in one spot I always know where to go to
get it so it's like oh yeah you know
just wave to the left if I need to get
to something like you know my bank or
you know shopping or social media or any
of that stuff as you can see you know
it's a big huge device and even I have
trouble wielding it sometimes all the
way on the right are my video games I
just finished testing like 35 40 50
video games so I cleaned out my my stock
a little bit so I don't have too much on
my device right now I've been getting in
the Skyforce a whole lot and obviously
Monument Valley and clash of clans has
been on my phone for ages um I do play
fantasy hockey I'm not very good at it
unfortunately but me know my team has
been doing pretty well as of late so
that's always good
you know it's we're he's like I'm the
app guy so I'm supposed to have like
more stuff than everybody but I actually
keep my devices pretty clean because I
do review so many applications that I
don't want all that stuff just hanging
around there so you know I keep the bare
minimum on my phone and when I'm done
reviewing an application unless I'm
deciding to keep it forever
I generally uninstall it so you know my
devices are pretty clean and I do
believe Gary is up next
hello everybody Gary's Sims here from an
authority what have I got on my Android
smartphone well as you can see I'm using
the Google now launcher and basically I
like to keep all my screens fairly
cluttered I don't like having to delve
down into the app drawer to find things
I really do like just to keep things
that I use a lot here on the front pages
I do use folders occasionally for
example here I've gotten and my news
folder where I've got my BBC news app
and the Yahoo
new digest but in general I keep things
upfront ready to get them let's go
through the apps pretty quickly
never got the Amazon Kindle in your book
reader app I do a lot of reading ever no
actually fantastic app for keeping all
the notes and things that I need inside
of it let's really go to tool for me
everyday on the desktop and on mobile I
use Twitter quite a lot and cause down
here at the bottom we've got the phone
icon
Gmail up at the essential Google Chrome
again absolutely essential and the
camera I've got I really into widgets
here at the top we've got the Alexia
widgets it allows me to create a user
define set of power tools which allows
me to see how much space I've got left
on the device a calendar you can choose
whatever you like I really like that and
this one is power toggles I like the
have quick access to the flashlights and
they'll turn the screen on and off just
by touching the button there on the
second screen put some more tools I used
the Amazon Appstore a lot I love the
free app of the day thing they have
going there that was one down from
yesterday
cut the rope time travel slack is a tool
we use an Android or thority always in
there talking to the rest of my
colleagues and teammates there and here

simple productivity games stuff for the
kids big mixture all up there on the
front page a home page just useful ready

hope you enjoyed looking at this my name
is Gary Sims thank you hi guys Jace here
from the Android authority team and as
some of you may know I am all about
audio books and audio podcasts and to
that I'm a big fan of audible you can
see there audible widget right on my
home screen but you know four or five
books a month is not enough so I have a
subscription to audiobooks calm and have
their widget right below there this is
my home screen it simply uses the Google
launcher and these are the apps that I
used most frequently I'm also a big fan
of double twist double twist as a media
player and at all
so is used to convert my very large
iTunes library to my Android devices so
that is a really great way that you can
automatically wirelessly sync I've
talked about that before but I hadn't of
it very much and this is slack slack is
the online collaboration tool that we
use on the Android authority team and I
thought when we initially started on
slack a few months ago that that would
just be another tool that you kind of
have to be burdened with but slack is
actually really good it's engaging I
like it we all use it it's a fantastic
thing I've also talked about any do that
I use every day any do as a task manager
kind of reminder that for some reason is
able to keep me on track consistently
without being pestering and I really
really like that now as you guys know
I'm a pretty hardcore calendar geek of
spending crazy amounts of money on the
best calendars but I still keep coming
back to Google Calendar I had lots of
hopes for it after the lollipop update
in the material design but unfortunately
they've taken out a proper month view I
mean they have a preview month view but
it's just not the the same it's not what
I want so I'm on the hunt again for
better calendar apps that does
everything that I wanted to do when I
use Google keep quite often just to take
notes and pictures and store them in the
cloud and all that good stuff on my
second page is the you know I have
prayer books and games you know I'm big
Angry Birds and quizup guy you guys know
I love daddy longlegs I played that for
quite a while with other Android
authority hosts a sauna is our task
manager that we use as a team and and I
use Flipboard quite a bit too for my
news a little bit of snapchat but that
is really about it I try and keep it
clean and minimal so that it's fast I
don't I don't root at least I haven't
wounded this phone because I haven't
really needed to does everything I
wanted to do it's super snappy never
lags and yeah obviously these are all my
cards I used those cards quite a bit if
you guys have any other questions please
put in the comments below I'll be sure
to read them and answer as many as I can
hey guys ash here
and I'm just quickly going to show you
what's on my home screen and what sort
of apps I use on an everyday basis so my
phone is rooted and I use the Google now
launcher in conjunction with exposed the
module I use is the exposed GTL settings
let me just quickly find that so I can
show you now this allows me to have
everything that Google now offers but
with the functionality of something like
Nova I tend to keep things quite simple
so you'll never really see too much on
my home screen I like to let the
wallpaper shine through I have the Appy
gamer widget which aggregates gaming
news and underneath that I have the
Google calendar widget which I love over
to the right we have the Appy geek
widget which like before aggregates tech
news and also general news underneath
that we have the Google keep widget
which I use in conjunction with Evernote
it's great for taking and inputting
quick notes they've made a quick
selection for you to show you the apps
that I use on an everyday basis first up
we have endomondo which is a fitness app
that I used to track all my runs and
cycle rides it offers a really nice
interface with good functionality for
tracking the various stats secondly
we've got f1 reader now I'm into Formula
One and this is a great app for keeping
up with all the news that may happen
moving on there's thing which is a great
network analysis tool
there's blacklist which gives the
ability to block any calls that don't
meet a certain set of parameters so for
example you could set it to block any
numbers that are private or any numbers
that aren't part of your contacts other
than listening I normally use two wraps
and they're quite simple the first is
the simple last.fm scrubber and it does
just that squabbling it's awesome
secondly there's Songkick which tracks
the artists that I follow viola FM and
inputs them into Google Calendar finally
for the last bunch of apps there's pin
out I am often making cables and this
app is a great reference for any form of
soldering to find out what terminals are
to be paired with what the last two I
think you will know the first is ES File
Explorer which in my opinion is one of
the best file explorers
out there it has great functionality and
then there's pocket for those who don't
know it allows you to save articles for
offline reading and there you go guys
that was my home screen and also what
sort of apps I tend to use on a day to
day basis thanks for listening and back
to you Kevin thanks ash and this was
Android authority what's on my device

press that like button and also go ahead
