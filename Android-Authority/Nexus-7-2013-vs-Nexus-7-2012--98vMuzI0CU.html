name is Kevin
aka head tech ninja and today I'm doing
a comparison between the Nexus 7 2012
and the Nexus 7 2013 edition let's get
going
in the summer of 2012 a soos and Google
teamed up to release the Nexus 7 a
7-inch pure Android tablet starting at
$200 and it was to redefine how much
quality manufacturers will be able to
pack into an economical peer Google
device the original Nexus 7 proved to be
very popular with tablet users and again
so much worldwide press attention that
non Android users became curious Google
had a new ambassador on their hands one
that will introduce millions to the
Android ecosystem and is somewhat
expected upgrade a year later Google has
released the Nexus 7 2013 edition
featuring substantial upgrades the new
Nexus 7 2013 packs a substantially
better display much better performance
and it's slimmer than the original 2 and
with retailers gearing up for the
holiday season many among us want to
know what are the primary differences
between the two how do they stack up
against one another let's get on in and
find out at the time of its original
release the 2012 Nexus 7 was considered
one of the best tablets on the market
sitting in at a spell point 41 inches
and barely moving the scales at 12
ounces it redefined what tablet
computing could be for people looking at
the Nexus 7 2013 editions design Google
and Asus have worked to make it both
slimmer and lighter which is quite an
achievement
they soos was able to cut the thickness
down by nearly a whole tenth of an inch
coming in at a thin point 34 inches the
new Nexus 7 feels amazing in the hand
and it's noticeably lighter than the
Oder Nexus 7
how much lighter you might ask a soos
and Google didn't let us down in that
department either it comes in at 10.55
ounces down from 340 grams to a delicate
290 grams this makes it one of the
lightest tablets going and it's a
delight to hold and it doesn't burden
the users like some other
heavier tablets do iPad the 2012 Nexus
uses a rubber backing that is easy to
grip and yet is also very pleasing to
the eye
the Nexus logo towards the middle back
of a device blends into the design of
the backing and so does the Asus logo
near the bottom and the speaker grille
is located just below that the bezels
are dull chrome color with the power
button and viola on the side of the
device for the owner Nexus 7 the only
camera on the device is located on the
front and it's for video chats and
hangouts and of course selfies and the
USB port is located at the bottom of the
device the 2013 Nexus device changes the
design material completely this time a
soft rubber coating in cases the whole
tablet the speaker grilles are sleek and
they blend in to the design of the
device they're located towards the
bottom and also towards the top of the
device that's right true stereo sound in
terms of button placement the power
button and volume rockers are in the
same locations the 2012 Nexus 7 features
a 1280 by 800 7 inch IPS display it
offers great color reproduction and is
capable of a modest 216 pixels per inch
the 2013 Nexus 7 has received a
significant bump in the display
department with its new gorgeous 1920 by
1200 7 inch IPS display pecking a
whopping 323 pixels per inch the new
Nexus 7 features the sharpest densest
display of any tablet in the world when
compared side-by-side with its
predecessor the Nexus 2013 display
really makes the original Nexus 7 screen
look dated the colors pop darks look
excellent and the white balance seems to
be near-perfect the high PPI really
allows the text to pop out at you and
it's sharpness is unmatched the higher
resolutions allows you to comfortably
watch a 1080p movie without missing much
of the picture
due to scaling and I would honestly put
it up there one of the best on a tablet
today the Nexus 7 2012 was the first
device to feature the NVIDIA Tegra 3 SOC
packing a quad-core 1200 megahertz
ARM Cortex a9 processor it also features
Nvidia
tegra graphics with ULP which is short
for ultra-low power
geforce twelve core GPU clocked at 416
hertz and you'll be able to find it in
eight gigabytes and sixteen gigabytes
flavours the Nexus 7 2013 edition has
received a change of processors and GPU
using the Qualcomm this time around it's
officially said that the Nexus 7 2013
uses a Snapdragon s4 pro but in reality
it's like a lower spec Snapdragon 600
the SOC itself is a quad core running up
to 1500 megahertz it also features the
powerful and Reno 320 processor for
graphics when compared with the original
Nexus 7 2012 impact is double the RAM
and two gigabytes and onboard storage
options include 16 gigabytes and 32
gigabytes the sole camera on the 2012
edition was a bit of a disappointment
coming in at a paltry 1.2 megapixels
Google really wanted this to be a video
chat only camera and opted not to
include a camera app out of the box
Google heard the complaints of many
users and decided to put in two cameras
on a successor the Nexus 7 2013 edition
the front-facing camera appears to be
similar on paper as a 1.2 megapixel
camera but the back camera is a 5
megapixel autofocus enabled camera
although it may not take stunning shots
it's still a suitable replacement if you
don't have any other cameras on hand
also for those of you that want a fast
mobile data experience the Nexus 2012
has the options for Wi-Fi and 3G while
the Nexus 7 2013 edition has Wi-Fi or
LTE connectivity both devices are up to
date with the latest Android OS the
newer Nexus which has the faster and
newer Snapdragon processor tends to load
applications just a tad bit faster and
the overall performance is just smoother
and that's to be expected the 2
gigabytes of RAM really kick in the play
when applications are installing or an
update is occurring in the background
and the Nexus 2012 really suffers from
that lag when it's occurring when
running a series of benchmarks on the
Nexus 7 it shows significant gains in
each test although benchmarks are not
the end-all be-all it's still good to
see how much faster it really is
when using both devices and day to day
activity
the Nexus 2013 was faster and virtually
always and once again the speed
differences are not in which will you
feel your Nexus 2012 is unusable but if
you compare them side-by-side it's very
noticeable rebooting the device you will
notice a five to eight second difference
and also when loading a high-end game
like Grand Theft Auto the load times are
almost cut in half and also the game
runs in a smooth fashion it's not just
one speck of the Nexus 7 2013 that's
causing the speed differences it's more
of a sum of its total parts overall if
you own the 2012 Nexus 7 giving the 2013
will be a significant upgrade the main
question is are you happy with your
current performance if so then waiting
until 2014 or even later may work best
for you it seems that Google has the
business model to release the refresh
every year so waiting every of the year
would be a method that many will follow
and it may be the best idea and if you
