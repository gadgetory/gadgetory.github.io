authority and the Android Q first
Developer Preview came out today and I
have it running here on my pixel 3 XL
it's also available for the regular
pixel 3 the pixel 2's and even the
original pixel so if you have a pixel
phone you can flash it starting today
and there's a lot of changes with
android q a lot of under the hood stuff
a lot of changes with things like
privacy and security and changes the
stuff like Vulcan and a bunch of other
stuff a lot of stuff that doesn't really
show too well on video but if you guys
want to learn more about that stuff we
cover that on the site so if you want to
read up on that we have our written
articles we'll link that down below in
the description so make sure to check
that out but in this video we're just
gonna cover a lot of the visual changes
and some of the features that they've
added here to Android Q so let's go
ahead and just jump right in
alright so when it comes to visual
changes there really aren't a ton for
the most part Android Q pretty much
looks identical to Android Pi one of the
most noticeable changes though is the
font so Google's been using products and
x' on certain parts of the OS like the
google feed and google maps and things
like that but google product stands is
now the official default font you'll see
this font in your notification shade now
also in your notifications and even in
the settings menu so this is the default
font across the board throughout the
entire Android OS another change is the
Settings menu itself some of the icons
are a little bit different but for the
most part they're exactly the same the
Wi-Fi icon for example is this 3 bar
icon instead of the pizza slice or
whatever you want to call it and your
app permissions your location and
security are all all now individually
grouped before a location and security
were actually bundled together and then
your app permissions were actually under
apps and notifications and technically
they still kind of are you have to tap
on advanced now and then you can get to
your app permissions from there but if
we go back here it's actually quicker to
get to them from privacy if you tap on
privacy your app
missions are right there again same
exact place and you can make the
adjustments that you need another big
change is the location app permissions
and this is going to be something that a
lot of people really appreciate so now
when you go into your app permissions
for location you now have the option to
allow the location access all the time
allow only while the apps and use or
deny it entirely and allow only while
the apps and use seems to be the default
setting and I think that's probably for
the best and that's probably going to be
the most popular option that people
going to pick so if you had any concerns
about privacy over your location data
things like that this will probably make
you more at ease and I think a lot of
you are going to like this change with
the location app permission another
change here visually not an official
change because it's under the developer
options but you can now change the
accent colors so if you go to developer
options and you scroll all the way to
the very bottom you have accent colors
here and it's not one plus level of
accent colors there's only a few to pick
from and it's not super extensive so you
have the default obviously which is blue
and then you have black green and purple
black is my favorite but I'll show you
purple here or green I mean there's
green and you can see that your
notification shade is green and let me
show you purple and there is purple and
you can see that your notification
toggles are purple and you'll see this
accent throughout other parts of the OS
as well but I'm going to go ahead and go
back to black here one change to Android
Q that might be a little bit
controversial is the way that
notifications are cleared now so
previously you'd clear notifications by
swiping them to the left or to the right
now you can only clear notifications by
swiping them to the right so if I swipe
this notification to the right it clears
us normal but if you swipe it to the
left it brings up your context menu
instead for blocking the notification or
snoozing it and what-have-you so if you
were more of a person that liked to
swipe your notifications to the left you
no longer have that
option you're basically being forced to
only swipe them in one direction I
actually personally did not notice this
because I like to swipe mine towards the
right but that's how it is here at least
for now this keep in mind this could
change down the road when Andrew queue
officially comes out another change here
that's kind of interesting and this one
is actually specific to the pixel 3
excel is the way that screenshots work
so when you take a screenshot on the
pixel 3 Excel it actually now
screenshots the knotch so I'll show you
what I mean here so I'll go to my photos
and I'll show you some screenshots that
I took earlier and here they are and you
can see that it's a screenshot but you
now have the knotch taken within the
screenshot as well which is a little bit
interesting I don't think I really like
this I want a normal screenshot when I
take a screenshot and as far as I can
tell there is not an option to take a
normal screenshot on the pixel 3xl on
this preview there might be one in here
I just haven't been able to find it or
they might add the option to where you
can take a normal screenshot later on in
later build so we'll have to wait and
see but for right now I personally don't
like this change but again it's only
specific if you have the pixel 3 XL so
the last big change that I want to
mention is the new emergency button and
this is accessible in the power menu so
if you hold down the power button here
obviously you have your power off
restart and screenshot options but now
you have a new emergency button down
below here and if you tap on that this
will take you to your dialer and
obviously your emergency information is
up above provided that you have filled
something out for the first responder to
look at and before this was accessible
on the lock screen with a button down
below but now it's much quicker and
easier to get to with just the power
button and you can access this from
anywhere whether the phone is locked or
unlocked but that's really it for all
the major visuals and feature changes
with Android Q again there's a bunch
more changes with Android Q especially
under the hood and like I mentioned
earlier if you want to find out about
that stuff make sure to check out the
description we'll leave some links down
below
to the written articles and let us know
your thoughts of Android queue down in
the description let us know if you've
tried it and let me just let us know
what you guys think of the new features
in Android queue and as always if you
