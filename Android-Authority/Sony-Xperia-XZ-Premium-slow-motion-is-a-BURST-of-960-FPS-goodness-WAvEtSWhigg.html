is a beast of a phone but its new camera
brings along a burst of 960 frames per
second goodness and you won't believe
what you'd capture you literally slowed
down time so we revisited Sony's booth
at MWC just check out the xperia x Z
premium a little bit more well honestly
we were more curious about its new 19
megapixel camera and its ability to
shoot at 960 frames per second now
that's not a joke because time is
effectively slowed down enough to the
point you see things that are usually
unseen by the eye most people would
assume that the camera records video
files at the rate of 960 frames per
second constantly but that's not the
case unlike how other phones do slow
motion where it's shot at the high frame
rate throughout the recording so you can
go back later on to trim and select the
portion you want slow down it's all done
the flies here with the Xperia XE
premium we can start recording there's
another on-screen button you're required
to tap on just to enable the mode so in
the camera interface you just see this
wiping motion on the screen to indicate
that moment when the faster frame rate
is enabled and believe us the footage
isn't captured just undeniably or
inspiring when we say slowing down time
to see all the stuff that's unseen we
really mean it to take a look at this
plane swinging around you can see the
motion the propeller or how about this
one
you
and this one with the bubbles
and you'll never look at a drop of
liquid the same way ever again
the only problem though is that you'll
need to be extra responsive when it
comes to timing it's because you still
have a small window of opportunity to
capture the moment press the button too
early or too late you might not have a
second chance to capture it and there
you go guys that's a quick look at the
new slow motion recording with the Sony
Xperia XE premium it looks pretty
awesome
you literally slow down time and if you
guys want more more about this phone you
