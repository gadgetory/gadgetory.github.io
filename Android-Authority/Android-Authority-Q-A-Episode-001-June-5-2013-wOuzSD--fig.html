to android authority QA episode number
14 jun 5th 2013 xi'an asks i had the
galaxy s3 from Rogers in Canada but I'm
thinking about switching carriers to
wint if i unlock the galaxy s3 will i be
able to use it with wind unfortunately
no rogers uses gsm technology for their
network while wind uses UMTS the s3 that
rogers puts out isn't compatible with
UMTS so even unlocking your phone won't
do you any good in this situation Kevin
asks I'm switching from a galaxy s3 to
an HTC One soon how can i backup my apps
and transfer them to the new device well
Kevin there are a few ways you can do
this first you can try Google's method
just go to settings then back up nice
set choose to backup your settings there
now when you log into your HTC One with
your google account it'll automatically
start downloading all the apps that you
used unfortunately that isn't going to
actually back up the apps it just
redownload them automatically if you
really want to back them up you can use
helium which was formerly known as
carbon backup that'll allow you to
backup to the cloud with a premium
version but if you just want to back up
to your pc or an SD card that'll work
fine with you you're going to want to
back up to a pc because the HTC one
doesn't have an SD slot hope this helps
ravit asks do you know when samsung will
update the galaxy s duos to jellybean
i'm having issues with mine we have no
idea actually samsung did announce that
the galaxy s duos was going to be
getting an upgrade to jellybean but that
was back in September 2012 and we
haven't really heard anything since now
you mentioned you're having issues if
you want you can always try running a
custom rom that uses jellybean but
that's beyond the scope of what we can
talk about in this video and as always
it's a little risky Anna cool says I'm
looking for a safe method to root my lg
optimus 2x p990 v30 be running ice
creams
sandwich I found one method but it uses
nvflash which I've never used before is
there any other reliable method it looks
like you've done your research and
looking around the main option we found
was the all-in-one tool kit available on
xda-developers now that will work with
your version but it does use nvflash
luckily though it does everything for
you and we've heard reports that it
works fairly well any other options we
found only worked on gingerbread a
mirror says my phone gets hot and starts
to slow down there are a lot of apps
running that I don't even use what can I
do without knowing what phone or version
of Android you're running it's hard to
give you specific advice but there are a
couple general things that might help
for one try uninstalling apps now if
these came pre-installed on your phone
you probably won't be able to get rid of
them but you might be able to disable
them and keep them from running if that
doesn't help there is a last resort
option you can try first back your phone
up as we talked about a few questions
ago then go into that same menu settings
backup and reset and reset your phone
but again make sure you're backed up if
this seems to improve performance just
start installing apps that you need one
by one and if you notice performance
take a hit take a look at the app that
you installed last that could be your
problem gian says I have 1080p m2ts
video files from a sony hx5v an
ex-player crashes and bsplayer works but
the video plays slower than the sound
how can i watch these on my tablet now
it sounds like the issue you're having
is that the video is too high of a bit
rate for your tablet to handle now
there's an option that should work for
you without having to buy anything what
you want to do is transcode your videos
from that fairly unusual format to
something that tablets are more used to
like mp4 there's a ton of software that
does this but it's fairly likely that
something was included with your camera
that might do
right out of the box now while you're
transcoding you might also want to lower
the resolution from 1080p to 720p
because that's probably the highest your
tablet shows anyway on that size of a
screen Jonathan asks when is the next
Nexus device going to be released well
you didn't say whether you're talking
tablet or phone so we'll cover both
first there was a rumor that Asus was
going to announce an updated Nexus 7
tablet at this week's computex but their
event came and went without any word of
it the event still is going on as I
record this but we still haven't heard
anything and it's looking less likely
that we will when it comes to a new
Nexus phone it's even trickier 1st LG
said they weren't working on a nexus 5
but then we heard Larry Page and seen a
nexus 5 prototype from LG in person for
more details on this see this week's a a
weekly that came out on Sunday now long
story short we'll probably see a new
Nexus device soon but we have no idea
when where or how Humphrey says I work
in construction and I need a durable
phone which phone is more durable the
HTC One or the samsung galaxy s4 now
that's a tricky question to answer the
HTC one's aluminium body is more likely
to den while the s4's polycarbonate body
is more likely to scratch that's not
even bringing the glass in to either of
these equations well i would do is leave
durability out of it and pick the phone
you want based on the features you want
then just get a really tough case
because if you do that you're pretty
well covered especially if you use a
good screen protector as well try asked
what is the one year warranty on my
galaxy s4 cover now before I answer your
question I just want to say real quick
that the protection you get will kind of
vary based on your carrier now the
Samsung warranty by itself basically
covers anything that is Samsung's fault
say your volume rocker stops working and
it's through no fault of your own your
warranty will cover that now so you
drop your phone and it breaks the
warranty won't cover that if you want to
get more detail you probably have a copy
of the warranty available to you given
that you own it and that's where you'll
find all the details sabash asks how do
i import my bookmarks from google chrome
into the galaxy s4 stock browser i'm
sorry to say this but it doesn't look
like you can you're not the only person
on the internet who's looked for ways to
do this and as far as I can see nobody
has successfully been able to import
their chrome bookmarks you're basically
going to have to do it manually now if
you wanted to go the other way there are
all sorts of ways to import other
bookmarks in to Chrome unfortunately the
other way around just doesn't seem to be
possible right now Todd says my phone
automatically uploads photos to the
instant upload folder in Google+ do
instant upload and Google Drive share
the same storage and if so what is the
purpose of storing photos in my Google
Drive account first things first yes
google+ gmail and google drive all
shared the same storage now as to why
you might want to upload photos to your
google drive that's different for
everybody i know i don't if you do
however and you don't want google+ to
instantly up your photos that's easy to
turn off just go into Google+ then go to
settings then camera and photos and auto
backup and just turn the feature off now
that won't happen and that's about all
we have for today folks if you want a
little more detail where some of the
links we mentioned we have a written
companion to this video android
authority calm you can find the link
down in the description you want to ask
us some questions of your own you can
also find a link for that in the
description if you just want to stay
