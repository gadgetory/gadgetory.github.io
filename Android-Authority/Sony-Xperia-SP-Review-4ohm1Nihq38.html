launched a successful comeback with the
Xperia Z and ZL but they have not
forgotten about the mid-range market now
the mid-range market may not be the most
exciting but it might just be another
place for Sony to shine a Java garfi
manager Authority what's going on
everybody and this is the Sony Xperia SP
under today's smartphone standards you
could probably tell at first glance that
this is not a top-tier device after all
the frame accommodates a 4.7 inch screen
and is altogether smaller than the
five-inch screen devices that we've seen
throughout 2013 sony has proven itself
with design on their flagship
smartphones and it shows on the espys
rectangular form the front is comprised
almost entirely of the screen and the
signature big silver power button is
about halfway down the side below volume
rockers and above a dedicated camera
button the frame is made of aluminum
which gives the phone some heft a sturdy
feel and easily gribble flat sides
around the back is the a megapixel
camera surrounded by a removable matte
plastic cover and finally at the bottom
of the devices a see-through plastic
that diffuses the LED notification light
this is definitely the most unique
aspect of the phone's design and is an
elegant yet different take on an
otherwise typical Android smartphone
feature in the hand the smaller form
factor really helps the handling the
aluminum is a nice touch and having a
matte plastic back keeps the phone from
slipping about if you haven't gotten
into five-inch screen just yet this
phone will make you feel right at home
overall the SP is a good example of
Sony's design experience and should
please most users with its good looks
and feel for those who have really
gotten into five inch screens however
the Xperia SP screen probably won't win
you over that being said this 4.7 inch
screen is capable of 720p resolution at
319 PPI of course the spec Hungary might
look elsewhere but this display is still
a good performer the TFT screen is
backed by the Bravia Engine just like
the Z and the ZL thus giving the phone
greater contrast aside slightly lowered
saturation it does somewhat suffer from
the same viewing angle issues as it's
big siblings but dead-on viewing is
still
great experience if you really want the
extra resolution in pixel density then
you have Sony's flagships available
otherwise average and perhaps even some
power users can come to appreciate how
last year's screen specs can still be
quite fun last year specifications make
another return with the Xperia SP s
performance it sports a dual-core
Snapdragon Krait processor clocked in at
1.7 gigahertz obviously it doesn't sound
as great as a quad-core Snapdragon 600
but 1.7 gigahertz is still more than
enough speed and power for the average
user a score of around 16,000 in n22
keeps the SP at a very respectable part
of the android ladder you'll get a lot
done quickly as the phone remains smooth
through its elements two gigabytes of
RAM are available for multitasking and
as for graphics the SP does keep up with
the rest of the pack by sporting the
Adreno 320 processor rest assured that
the Xperia SP will be a more than
capable companion actually you could
view this less as old and more like last
year specs perfected hardware offerings
on the Xperia SP remain pretty standard
Wi-Fi GPS Bluetooth and NFC are all
available for your connection needs and
there will be different variants made
for HSDPA and LTE networks only eight
gigabytes are available for storage but
that matte plastic cover actually houses
a micro SD card slot for SD cards of up
to 32 gigabytes in capacity for a sony
phone sporting a Walkman app the espys
rear mounted speaker thankfully is a
better performer than the ones found in
dizzy and ECL it's nice and loud without
being as tinny
and of course as you can see at the
bottom the Xperia SP is having a little
party of its own with a dynamic LED
light
it not only blinks when notifications
happen it goes along with it whatever
music the phone is playing it's a great
addition that really sets this phone
apart from its fellow performers and
it's definitely this phone's cool factor
usually a removable cover is good news
and a sign of two big features
unfortunately I have to burst that
bubble and say only one of those
features made it on to the Xperia SP I
already mentioned the microSD card slot
so sadly the battery is not user
replaceable but it's not all bad news
for a 4.7 inch screen device it packs a
big 23 70 milliamp hour battery with
slightly less powerful bits inside this
phone's battery can easily go the
distance a locally looped video ran down
half of the battery in just over three
hours making this phone likely capable
of close to seven hours of straight
local media consumption maybe more if
you take advantage of the good power
saving features the battery is a great
example of how the Xperia SP manages to
blur the line between mid range and
top-tier or last year in current specs
the 8 megapixel camera on the Xperia SP
takes the same general idea from the Z
and the Z L Sonya superior Auto Works to
find the right scene mode to use for the
frame and features like HDR touch
capture and panorama are also available
all of these modes are easily accessible
in the app viewfinder pictures are
pretty good with nice contrast and
details though they can be a little too
saturated at certain times low-light
performance though unsurprisingly
yielded lower quality pictures
ultimately the camera on the Xperia SP
is a capable shooter but isn't as a
great as even other performers from last
generation when 8 megapixels were the
norm compared to today's 13 megapixels
and finally the software the Xperia Z's
UI basically makes its return in this
jellybean 4.1.2 build it is the same
melting pot of elements from multiple
sources Ice Cream Sandwich inspired
colour schemes and jellybean features
like Google now and Sony editions apps
like the Walkman and the album photo
gallery bolstered the small apps small
overlays accessible from the recent
screen Sony takes a more minimalistic
approach to their UI and if you prefer
the basics with some extras and then all
in a nice shell the Xperia U I should
still please
there aren't any listings for the Xperia
SP on US carriers just yet but it should
come in between 100 to 150 dollars on
two-year contracts when unlocked it is
decently priced right under $500 u.s.
and so there you have it the spec hungry
and those looking to be on the bleeding
edge might look past the Xperia SP but
even for them this should still be an
attractive package sure it's sports last
year's processor and a 720p display but
on top of all of that it still feels
like a very high quality proper Xperia
phone the price is a good selling point
as it's half the price of a lot of
top-tier current devices and when you
add in a couple of the unique features
it has like the LED light at the bottom
you have a unique experience that a lot
of people should still have a lot of fun
