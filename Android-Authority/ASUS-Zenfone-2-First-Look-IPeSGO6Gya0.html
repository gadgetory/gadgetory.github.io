Authority what's going on everybody and
here we are with the brand-new Asus
zenfone 2 this is an update to the
zenfone line from last CES and in 2014
that we actually were very big fans of
mostly because of their price point but
four to nine two hundred dollars rather
$1.99 you do get a two gigabyte version
of this we don't know what the price
would be for the four gigabyte edition
but nonetheless you still get a lot of
premium features and a great experience
with this 5.5 inch screen that comes in
at 720p resolution and is covered in
Corning Gorilla Glass 3 underneath the
surface though we have choices between
among 8 16 and 32 gigabytes of on-board
storage and the processor is a 64-bit
intel atom z3580 560 depending on which
version you get there's a quad core
processor that's backed by a power VR
GPU I'm going through the interface
right now and so far I have a very good
time going through all of the elements
of the brand-new Zen UI that provides a
lot more customization and
personalization options for you to make
this phone truly your own we have
capacitive keys down here on the bottom
but as you can see the Zen UI has been
updated to Android a lollipop and you
can tell already because of not only
these cards in the recent apps screen
but also coming down in the notification
drop-down you have that particular
element to the notifications a 3000
milliamp hour battery is underneath as
well and you also get as far as the
cameras go a 13 megapixel rear shooter
and a 5 megapixel front facing shooter
as we take a somewhat closer look at the
display here I do want to clarify that
the $1.99 version of this phone will be
the 1080p Edition at 2 gigabytes of RAM
underneath this is the 720p Edition that
does also still have 2 gigabytes of RAM
but it will come in at a somewhat more
affordable price point that they're
remaining a little bit hush-hush at
right now the 4 gigabyte edition like we
said we don't really know the price
point yet they're being pretty hush-hush
about that one as well but nonetheless I
do think the 720p Edition that we're
taking a look at here especially if it
comes in at a much better even better
affordable price point this is going to
be a quite compelling package to have if
you're going to get in affordable but
high quality device the Zeus is
definitely able to do so with these in
line a pixelmaster is involved here as
well as you will be able to use it to
get great HDR photos and in low-light
situations you have photos that they
claim are up to four hundred percent
brighter now there is also a lot of
customization options here with the
zenfone 2 we have here this a silver one
but if you look a little bit closely
like I'm showing you right now there's
this hairline brush design on the back
that eliminates some of the smudges or
the fingerprint magnet that a lot of
other phones tend to have with their
glossy plastic but as you can see this
shine right here is really attractive
the button layout on the back allows for
the volume to be controlled in this
fashion right here and the bezel around
the zenfone 2 is actually quite
respectable I do enjoy the design of
these end phones especially this one and
considering the price point that you are
able to get these phones I this really
feels like a premium device and it's
something that a soos has been able to
do very well in this part of the market
especially with these right here I
already mentioned that the button layout
on the back includes the volume rockers
right here but the power button is also
up here as well and as we go around the
device I really do enjoy what I'm seeing
here the Zen UI has a lot of
customization that is available here
that bolsters the fact that you can get
this phone in a bunch of different
colors even two toned additions that are
available as well and you know we have
an app drawer coming around here all of
the abilities that you that you would
expect from the Zen UI that brings a
nice premium feeling Android to here and
is powered by Intel Atom so that was
just a look at the zenfone 2 from Asus
it's a great looking phone with a lot of
great features underneath at a beautiful
price point you are going to get two
gigabytes here the four gigabyte edition
will not come in at $200 but we don't
imagine it's going to be way too much
more in that particular Edition
nonetheless you'll have a great
experience here with a somewhat larger
screen at 5.5 inches that brings all of
the nice colors as you can see plainly
there on the video so keep it tuned to
200 authority for our future review of
this end phone to this great affordable
phone and stay tuned for even more
coverage from us here at CES 2015 this
is Android authority your source for all
things
