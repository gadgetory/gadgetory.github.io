hindi from android authority comm apple
music was released in 2015 and everybody
wants to know which ones are the best
Apple music Spotify or Google Play Music
all access in this video we're gonna
find out okay folks this comparison is
going to go down in five rounds we're
going to take a look at the basic
content to see what you get from each
service then we'll talk about design
playlists and curation extra features
and then the best bang for your buck
once that's all done we'll decide a
winner let's get started the first and
arguably most important thing that we're
going to take a look at is content after
all you'll be forking out ten dollars
per month for each of these services and
it's good to know what you'll be paying
for upfront please note that all three
services are equally good at providing
the latest popular music and most of the
popular music from the last six decades
or so Google Play Music all access was
first launched in 2013 following Google
i/o and currently boasts 35 million
songs on top of that users can upload
50,000 of their own songs to google play
music which will then be added to their
library for streaming any music you
purchase on google play music will also
be added to your collection you'll also
get untold amounts of content from
YouTube as well because YouTube bread is
also included in the price of play music
a single account cost $9.99 and a family
account that supports up to six accounts
is 14.99 you can use play music for free
but you're limited to playlists and
music you've either uploaded or
purchased from the service Spotify was
first launched back in 2008 and
currently advertises more than 30
million songs in their catalogue they
also support video content as well as
podcasts Spotify can also read your
locally stored music but you'll have to
sync it through your device through
Spotify as desktop application first a
single account costs $9.99 Spotify is in
the works for revamping their family
plans but for now a family plan is $9.99
for the first person and then $4.99 for
each additional person Spotify also
supports a 50% discount for students you
can use the service for free and you'll
get most of the features as long as you
don't mind some advertisements
Apple music began life as beats music
but was officially launched in its
current form in 2015 and their catalog
includes over 30 million songs on top of
that users can upload up to 100,000 of
their own songs to iCloud to be streamed
back to them in a very similar fashion
as google play music any music you have
purchased in itunes is also available
for immediate streaming a single account
costs $9.99 and family plans cost $14.99
which supports up to six people
currently Apple music has no free
version and is the only one of the three
to not have this overall content is a
really straightforward endeavor all
three services have more songs than
you'll ever listen to so it's not like
you can really lose this category that
said Google Play Music wins because it
does include YouTube bread which adds
music and video content to an extent
that the competition can't possibly hope
to match in second place comes Spotify
thanks to its podcasts and video content
with Apple music coming in third because
it really just has music of course all
of the content in the world matters
little if you don't actually enjoy using
the application we took a look at all
three services to see what it was
actually like to use the applications
please note that all of the design
testing was done with full paid accounts
for all three services Google Play Music
uses material design which means you're
in for a bright colourful and generally
enjoyable music browsing experience when
you open the slide-out menu you'll be
greeted with the listen now top charts
new releases my library brow stations
and then the settings options each page
does pretty much what the title says it
does and you'll always understand where
you're going and what you're doing
inside of the app on all pages you'll
find a chromecast button and a search
button in the upper right-hand corner
the applications biggest weakness is how
it's organized in my library browse and
other parts of the app there are a ton
of tabs that you have to swipe through
in order to see everything in this
instance it could be argued that Google
Play Music is a little too flashy at
times when a simpler more streamlined
approach would have made things faster
and easier when you play music the music
player is constantly accessible either
in the notification drop-down or as a
truncated box at the bottom of any given
page the player itself is pretty
standard with prominently featured album
arts along with a thumbs up and thumbs
down buttons and the standard controls
the bottom Spotify uses a lot of the
same basic principles as google play
music for the majority of your
navigation is going to take place by
opening the left slide-out menu and then
picking your category however Spotify
takes a much less flamboyant approach
and does a better job at getting you
where you need to go it also employs
material design but seems to do so in
more measured doses the application
opens to your library page which in my
humble opinion is the correct place to
open a music app from there you can use
the slide-out menu to go to search
browse radio and then back to your
library if you need to much like google
play music the title of each category
more or less explains what each one does
the only bad part about Spotify is that
it does cramp a lot of content into a
little space you'll find podcasts video
content and curated playlists in the
Browse section which makes the radio
section seem oddly redundant the music
player is almost identical to google
play music but with the buttons in
slightly different places despite what
you may have heard the application
experience on Apple music isn't all that
different from the other two it also
relies on a left slide-out menu where
you'll be doing most of your navigation
the application launches to the for you
page where you'll find recommendations
based on your listening habits you'll
also have access to new radio connect
playlists and my music sections straight
from the left side menu these sections
do exactly what their titles suggest
there aren't many surprises with Apple
music each section is well defined and
everything is displayed well the only
real complaint is the application relies
heavily on your device's back button and
some pages have on-screen back buttons
while others do not
this creates a disjointed and sloppy
feeling in the application as your
fingers will have to bounce frequently
between your back button and the
navigation buttons in the top left
corner the music player is similar to
the competition but again with buttons
moved around slightly all three
applications had surprisingly good
showings in the design department and
aside from some quirks here and there do
everything pretty much the same way we
gave Spotify the win here because the
application seemed to strike that
perfect balance where it looked good but
was also quick and functional Google
Play Music definitely had the
best-looking interface but it
consistently sacrificed speed and user
experience just for the sake of being
flashy Apple music looked good but the
sloppy execution and antiquated feeling
track
down an otherwise pleasant experience
all three services offer the ability to
create playlists along with curated
pre-made playlists for you to listen to
this is a huge feature because it kind
of dictates how we listen to music on
the services and curated playlists are a
huge draw thanks to the popularity of
radio streaming sites such as
iheartradio and Pandora as expected
Google Play Music allows you to create
your own playlists playlists creation is
rather simple you find the songs you
want and then add them to the playlists
it's worth noting that since you get ad
free YouTube and the ability to play
YouTube audio with the screen off the
playlist feature can also be used in
YouTube with similar results you can
share playlists by making them public if
you want to back in 2014 Google
purchased Songza in order to improve
their curated playlists and it worked
not only can you find the usual
playlists based on genre but Google Play
music also has playlists for various
moods and activities we thought that was
spectacular and all of the options offer
up hundreds of playlists for various
situations and emotions you can also
start a playlist based on song genre or
artists that you like Spotify follows a
lot of the same lines as Google Play
Music you can create your own playlists
by surfing for songs and then adding
them Spotify also has a strong social
component where you can share and import
playlists from other people Spotify will
also maintain a starred playlist with
the music you have favorited for easy
access to stuff you know you're going to
like the service also has a decent
curated playlists selection they adhere
to basic genre selection and each genre
has a variety of playlists based in that
genre Spotify is saving grace in the
curation department comes in the form of
their weekly Discovery playlists these
are 30 random songs that you've never
heard before that are compiled based on
your musical tastes this feature has had
rave reviews and it's an effective
method of discovering new music without
being overwhelmed to put it bluntly
Apple music has the best self-made
playlists out of the whole bunch when
you add a song to a playlist on Apple
music the service automatically adds
that song to your library as well which
is unique in this comparison that means
you can build a library and playlist
simultaneously which can save you a lot
of time and effort in the long haul
Apple music uses the genre system for
curated playlists which has even fewer
options than Spotify right now
the service does have a 24/7 live radio
station called beats one that is pretty
enjoyable it has live music live radio
hosts interviews and brings a certain
human feel to an otherwise robotic
experience the only bad part is that it
tends to play popular music which may
not interest those who don't like
popular music this was another very
close call Google played music wins
again because it simply pounds the
competition into submission with the
vast amount of playlists that you can
interact with on both the Play Music app
and on YouTube
Apple music came in second with the best
user made playlists of all three of them
and the beats 1 radio station offered a
fun unique experience that neither
competitor could successfully replicate
Spotify weekly discovery playlist is
utterly fantastic but aside from this
single 30 song playlist
Spotify doesn't really have anything
that wasn't replicated by its
competition and therefore comes in third
most people will be picking up one of
these three services in order to listen
to music however that is not all that
they can do each of these services
offers unique features aside from just
music streaming many features such as
the ability to save music for offline
listening are shared between all three
services so we'll focus on the ones that
make them different google play music
has a strong game when it comes to
additional features the one that is
worth talking about most is of course
YouTube bread YouTube bread gives you
additional features in the YouTube music
application offers add for YouTube
videos on both computer and the
application and then it also allows you
to listen to YouTube videos with the
screen off YouTube is of course the
single biggest video streaming site on
this entire planet this adds an
insurmountable amount of video content
that ranges from tech to sports funny
videos music videos video podcasts and
even those goofy 5 second quote clips of
that show that you like it's also worth
mentioning the Google Play Music is the
only application out of the three that
can recognize your locally stored
content so it also acts as your
standalone music player Spotify biggest
draw outside of music is the addition of
podcasts and video content both have
been integrated surprisingly well into
the existing interface and we had no
trouble interacting with the content at
all the podcast and video content is a
bit scarce with how new it is but we
expect the library to grow over time
for now you can find stuff like clips of
Jimmy Fallon and epic rap battles of
history along with podcasts such as The
Nerdist and various podcasts by how
stuff works the one feature that we
haven't discussed for Apple music yet is
the Kinect feature it gives your typical
user the ability to follow various Apple
profiles and artists and then engage
with them you can choose who to follow
and as you read status updates you can
drop a heart if you like it and even
comment if you want to with this you can
get first dibs on new stuff from your
favorite artists but otherwise it's
essentially a more exclusive version of
Twitter truth be told we didn't weigh
the additional features category very
heavily because these are primarily
music streaming services which makes
additional features icing on the cake
rather than a focal point for value that
said Google Play Music had the best
extra features thanks to its inclusion
of YouTube's bread which also adds so
much content to the table Spotify has
native video and podcast support which
gave it a solid second-place finish but
ultimately can't compete with YouTube
Apple music came in third because it is
brand-new and it doesn't really do much
yet outside of streaming music finally
we're going to discuss which service has
the best bang for your buck the question
we're trying to answer is whether or not
you're getting what you pay for and how
far your dollar is being stretched when
you actually pay for these services
Google Play Music does a great job of
providing a lot of content for a
reasonable price you get the 35 million
songs cloud storage for up to 50,000 of
your own songs
hundreds of curated playlists and
support across virtually every operating
system with YouTube's bread you get an
untold amount of additional music and
content ad-free along with other
features there isn't a service available
that can boast that kind of content
library for a scant ten bucks a month
Spotify offers quite a bit as well you
get the 30 million songs playlists
podcasts and video content all ad-free
you also get the weekly discovery
playlists support across almost any
operating system just like Google Play
Music and one of the better designed
music streaming apps the family plan is
up to twice the price of play music or
Apple music which really sucks but if
you're a college student you can't beat
that 50% off you would think that Apple
music would suffer here but it actually
doesn't do half bad
you'll have 30 million songs along with
a few curated playlists Apple music also
gives you free cloud storage for up to
100,000 songs similar to Google Play
music so you can bring your own library
along with you you can also get the
human touch with beats 1 and a dedicated
social media service and connect to
follow your favorite artists as much as
my fellow Android fanboys don't want to
hear this the service objectively isn't
that bad
this one was ridiculously close Google
Play Music wins again because of
YouTube's bread Spotify has the most
amount of native content and doesn't
rely on outside services for its video
content which puts it in a solid second
place Apple music almost matches Google
Play Music feature for feature but it
doesn't have the advantage of YouTube's
bread to bolster its content offerings
and gets a third-place finish this ended
up being a much more difficult
comparison than was originally
envisioned all of these applications hit
all of the most important points when it
comes to design content and playlists
with only minor differences and nitpicks
between them they all have additional
features that add value as well however
at the end of the day Google Play Music
has that proverbial streaming cheat code
with YouTube red which sets it apart
from the rest of the competition
and gives it the overall win as the best
music streaming service available right
now
Spotify gets second place overall
because it is just that damn good I
would say that Spotify may very well
have won this if not for YouTube red
adding so much extra content to the
table and I want it noted that Spotify
definitely has the best free option out
of the three Apple music places third
but it was a much stronger showing than
I had originally anticipated when I
began this comparison it really did well
an apple should be proud that they hit
so many positive notes on such an early
release finally I want it noted for the
record that if YouTube's bread and
Google Play Music all access ever do
decide to part ways we may have to do
another video because Google Play Music
may not be the champion anymore in the
end it all inevitably boils down to
personal taste we can be as objective as
possible but as they say the best
features are the ones that you actually
use so many of our determinations may
not be applicable to everybody and we're
aware of that at the end of the day all
three of these streaming services are
pretty damn good and you really
can't go wrong either way and that about
does it for this video folks if you
agree with our assessment give us the
thumbs up and if not leave us a comment
and tell us why you think so don't
