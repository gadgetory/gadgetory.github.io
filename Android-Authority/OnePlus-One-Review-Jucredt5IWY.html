after the announcement of this phone is
any indication we're dealing with the
most anticipated release of the year
does this phone truly never settle for
anything less than the best well let's
find out because it's Josh Vergara from
Android authority and this is the one
plus one coming in at five point five
inches in its screen perhaps the first
thing you'll notice about this phone is
its size and then you start to see all
the elements that put it all together up
front is of course that screen but also
with a respectable bezel all around that
houses not only the front facing camera
up top but also a row of capacitive keys
that aren't really illuminated much at
all but they are definitely there as we
will talk about later the capacitive
keys can be rendered inactive in lieu of
software keys which is a unique feature
of this phone software and luckily the
bottom bezel isn't so big that this move
would make no sense around the sides
you'll see the button layout that
consists of easily accessible buttons on
the left and right the power button is
just low enough so that it's easy for
you to reach it with your thumb and thus
be able to activate it easily and
pressing the buttons brings a pretty
meaty click which is nice considering
they are pretty thin to begin with and
the top of the phone houses the
headphone jack while the bottom of the
phone has the dual speaker setup and the
microUSB charging port it's when you
come to the back that you really begin
to see some quality and you can also
feel it as well the 13 megapixel optics
the oneplus logo and the cyanogen logo
are all atop a smooth plastic created by
a company called cashew the material of
which was called baby skin in the
presentation it is indeed incredibly
soft and has a really nice feel the
material might not stick too easily to
your hand but it also isn't so slippery
that you would be afraid of dropping it
all the time now like some of the people
over at one-plus we're saying when I was
there for the launch events the real
test of it is when you rub it on your
face and I will admit it does feel
pretty nice the back cover is removable
but there was one issue with it I have
to remove the SIM tray in order to begin
that process but the hole that you press
into in order to pop it out is deep the
tools that I would normally use on any
other phone just didn't get the job done
and I had to use either a paperclip or a
long needle to get it out
after that you are able to take away the
first snap from under the symmetry and
move all around as needed after that
it's nice that it's not just the back
panel but the entire shell that comes
off because when you get your wood and
even denim offerings it completely
changes the look of the phone without
leaving literally any remnants of the
original aesthetic and finally when it
comes to handling you are dealing with a
phone that is pretty similar in
dimensions to the likes of the Samsung
Galaxy Note 3 and the Oppo find 7 but I
would actually argue that this is not
only the best looking of the bunch but
it's also the best handling not only
does the oneplus one have a simplistic
ly elegant look it's tapered back and
slightly thinner profile make it easier
to maneuver around and even though you
might not be able to use one hand all
the time on this device it is certainly
possible in some respects a 5.5 inch
1080p IPS display brings some great
quality to this very affordable phone we
already talked about its size but a
bigger screen has its advantages as well
earlier this week I was able to watch
half of a wrestling pay-per-view easily
and that was my aha moment with the
oneplus ones larger display even if I
had the issues trying to easily handle
the device media consumption was
undoubtedly fun on this display doing
anything from watching movies to playing
games was enjoyable on this device with
good colors all around and the signature
IPS brightness further allows for better
viewing even in broad daylight 401
pixels per inch allow for the kind of
sharpness and text that you would expect
from a screen that's good and on a
screen that is large enough to warrant
the kind of reading and webpage browsing
you may be doing so you may be saying to
yourself good job so far on the design
and the display but what about the power
underneath well the never settle
campaign continues with the current most
powerful package underneath the hood the
Snapdragon 801 clocked in at 2.5
gigahertz backed by the adrenal 330 and
3 gigabytes of ram the ram of which is
still a bit of a rarity even in certain
flagship devices today we've been
conditioned to believe that affordable
phones just won't be the fastest ones
out there but oneplus is hoping to buck
that trend and they certainly do so not
just with the processing package but
with the backing of CyanogenMod
optimizations getting around cm 11s is a
breeze and multitasking is easy jumping
in and out of the recent apps screen web
browsing was also very good with no real
rendering issues when scrolling deep
through pages and of course the gaming
experience tended
be very good as I have gotten through
half of Riptide gp2 already without any
issues at all as I've just mentioned
signage and mod is at the helm of the
software experience but they are able to
take advantage of processor features as
well for example this quick boot ability
in the developer options allows you to
turn off the phone in a lighter state
for much faster launch times it's not a
full shutdown but you can turn off the
phone - let's say save battery life and
then get back into your operating system
in seconds when you need it the bottom
line here being that while you are in
good hands already with the Snapdragon
801 you're also in good hands because
the developer of the software knows that
processor inside and out on the hardware
side you might find somewhat less as
offered here but that probably shouldn't
come as any surprise because of that low
price point you aren't getting any
expandable storage on the oneplus one
but you can always opt for 64 gigabytes
of built-in storage on the black version
of the oneplus one and it looks like a
lot of you are because oneplus has
already announced that they are bringing
out the 64 gigabyte black version first
in the release cycle over the white one
at 16 gigabytes all of the connectivity
you would want is included as well
including 4G LTE as evidence to buy my
using this phone easily on the t-mobile
network call quality was an interesting
prospect on this particular model I'm
using while I sounded loud and clear to
the people on the other side of the line
and there were no dropped calls
experienced the volume of the call was
quite low on my end now I've been in
touch with the guys over at cyanogen and
they have assured me that this is a
software issue that they've been working
on and that more volume optimizations
will be made in future builds of CM 11s
also don't worry with all these little
quirks that you might be seeing in this
review I will give you an update video
once I get my hands on the version of
the phone that I am buying myself
speaking of the speaker the dual speaker
setup on the bottom of the phone
provides some adequately loud audio it's
not particularly rich and certainly it
just gets the job done
allowing you to enjoy media even in
typically loud environments but plug in
the headphones and you'll enjoy the
audio effects capability cyanogen worked
hard to build it's a great app that
gives you presets and also equaliser
freedom to cater the sound to your
liking and for you bass lovers out there
the bass boost knob has been given
center stage in the app finally you get
a 30 100 million
battery in the 1+1 that is more or less
the standard for phones of this size and
with that said the battery life is also
pretty standard nightly charging will
probably be normal for you however as
the day and a half run time is only
really possible with some very frugal
usage so here's what it looked like when
I was doing that camera shootout out in
Venice Beach now mind you with the
camera and video recording that I was
doing the phone was constantly trying to
look for network in the black hole that
is Venice Beach but beyond that I was
actually able to watch part of that WWE
pay-per-view I was able to make a bunch
of calls it sent out a lot of text and
even do some searches via maps in Chrome
and by the end of the day I still had a
double digits left in my battery life
and as we move on to the camera Sony's
Exmor AMX 214 sensor is what backs I
know Jin's own camera application will
start with the app which comes with a
lot of features built into its version
of the Google camera interface one
bummer at least for me was that the full
13 megapixel resolution only yields you
four by three aspect ratio photos it
might not bother a lot of users out
there but it's really just a preference
of mine the menus in the app you'll do a
bunch of scene modes and live filters
all of which can be selected for a
swiping interface that easily allows you
to switch among them the live filters
are a nice touch as they show up in the
entire viewfinder now dive deeper and
you'll find the settings available for
ISO and exposure compensation as well as
the option to even change the codec used
for video capture picture quality was
already shown in the camera shootout and
I was quite impressed with what came out
colors were not dull nor were they too
saturated the level of detail and plenty
of the shots was really nice and in low
light the camera performed about as well
as it could even add a concert that I
went to now easily taking advantage of
the filters and modes will allow you
quick capture of your scene just the way
you want it as the focusing speed is not
lightning-fast
but decent enough to get your shot off
in time video captured in 4k brought
some good quality videos as well but
hopefully you are on the 64 gigabyte
version of the phone if you're going to
be making a lot of videos this way
I personally ran out of space in no time
at all with about three minute clips
taking up about one and a half gigabytes
of storage
slow motion is also available at 720p
resolution allowing for 60 or 120 frames
per second capture that yield half or
quarter speed
videos and finally the audio capture
during videos as you may have seen in
the camera shootout only recorded the
left channel but this was a software
issue and like I said already the guys
over at Santa Jean are already on the
case so this is just a temporary issue
and of course if you need to step up
your selfie game all the live filters
are available for usage in the five
megapixel front-facing shooter so
ultimately you have a very capable photo
and video package in the oneplus one
that may not necessarily blow everyone
away but can be arguably placed among
some of the best Android phones out
today and finally in software we have
the newest version of CyanogenMod 11 s
powering the oneplus one what results is
an experience much akin to a stock
Android feel but then packs a lot of
customization underneath turn on the
phone and the first thing you're greeted
with is the custom lockscreen that is
pretty much just a simple pull down
but once you pull down the lock screen
you have the home screens that are a
canvas for you to put widgets icons
folders pretty much anything that you
need on there which is a pretty
classical nexus experience but once you
dig a little bit deeper there's a lot
more that it offers the themes available
in the showcase application are still
rather limited but will grow over time
all of the themes are linked to listings
in the Play Store and not all of them
are free but the ability to change
anything from fonts to even your boot
screen means that with some time
invested you'll be able to really make
cm look the way you want it to now dive
deeper within and you'll find even more
features that make life easier like
gestures with the screen off you can
draw a number of different gestures for
various tasks like double tapping to
turn on the screen and drawing a circle
to easily get to the camera they're
useful especially if you don't
accidentally trigger them which can
happen very often even then some
features included show cyanogen zone
vision of android whisper push is good
for anyone looking to encrypt sensitive
information center text and then the
privacy guard allows you to see what
your apps are doing when they are
accessing pieces of information like
your current location screencast is a
built-in feature allowing for screen
capture which is one really cool
addition that is built into the
operating system and then the gallery
app elegantly groups together your
pictures into moments in an attractive
grid format and as a final look at the
customization we have the ability to
move back and forth between the
capacitive keys and the soft keys so if
you want to use one over the
other you finally can have your pick
even the buttons themselves are
customizable change what the
double-tapping or holding of the
capacitive keys do or even change the
layout and behavior of the soft keys to
your liking in the end CyanogenMod has
really found a new home with the oneplus
one a device that packs all of the power
and hardware for it to play with but
also it affords the opportunity force an
organ to really show what its operating
system is made of you're probably sick
of hearing the price by now or not
because it really is that good $2.99 for
the base model and $349 for the 64
gigabyte Black Edition which will likely
be coming first in the release cycle so
you ask what can beat that price well
the main competitors at the $2.99 price
point are ones that just don't stack up
the Moto G with its great value also
packs significantly less power all
around the Moto X can be found on sale
for $2.99 more often these days and
while it's optimized take on Android is
one of the most accessible experiences
out there it also isn't all that
powerful in comparison still at the 349
price points the closest competition is
obviously the Nexus 5 which provides
stock Android Kit Kats with a somewhat
slower processor and fairly comparable
hardware except at that price you only
get the 16 gigabyte version compared to
the massive 64 gigabytes of the oneplus
one at the same price and so there you
have it the - I mean the oneplus one
it's obvious oneplus did all it could to
keep from settling for second best with
the performance aspect - the
above-average camera quality and
cyanogen in its corner the price you pay
for such a powerful package seems way
too good to be true but throughout my
usage of this device in the past week
I've struggled to find the cut corner
that might take all that magic away so
far I haven't found it handling aside
this is one great looker of a device and
with the power underneath it hasn't been
hard to have fun with a large screen and
performance sano gen mod 11s will please
anyone looking for a set it and forget
it interface while those who love to
tinker will get their kicks as well only
somewhat above average battery life and
the lack of expandable storage might be
the only sore spots but they're pretty
easy to forgive when you're paying so
little for so much it's not very often
that I get to review a phone and then I
look at it and realize I could actually
buy this phone and you know what I
do think that that is what makes the 1+1
as always thank you guys very much for
watching and I hope you enjoyed this
review of the 1+1 yes at 299 that really
is the icing on the cake for the base
model of this phone and at 349 you get
even more storage but even if it didn't
come in at that price point this phone
still definitely packs a wallop so keep
it tuned to Android a thority like I
said I'm going to be giving you an
update video because those quirks and
kinks that are currently in the device
I'm using right now will likely be fixed
in the general release whether it's the
software or otherwise so once I get my
hands on the version that I'm going to
be buying I will give you an update on
what was fixed or what was enhanced so
keep it tuned to Android thority for
that to drop us some likes because we'd
