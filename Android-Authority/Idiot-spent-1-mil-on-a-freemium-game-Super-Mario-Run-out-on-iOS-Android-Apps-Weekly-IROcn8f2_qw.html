handy the Android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly this
is episode number 170 so let's get
started Google all√¥ limped over the 10
million installations mark earlier this
week it's a number to be proud of but we
all know that alo has had a cold
reception from almost everyone that
makes the 10 million mark seen both
impressive and just a little bit sad the
application has been getting better and
we're sure it's only a matter of time
before things pick up a little more
as it stands these things are marathons
and not Sprint's so it's still too early
to call this a success or a failure
Evernote has updated their privacy
policy and everybody's pretty mad about
it the policy will give a small number
of Evernote employees the ability to
view your notes according to the CEO
this is so the machine learning features
that will be implemented soon can work
properly thankfully the company will
give users the option to opt out if they
want to the change will take place in
late January so keep your eyes peeled if
you use Evernote ok so get this
someone actually went and spent 1
million dollars on a freemium game the
guy who did it actually stole the money
from a job that he was working he then
turned around and blew a million of it
on a game called game of war he also
spent money on plastic surgery and
season tickets to the San Francisco
49ers clearly this is not a man who
makes positive life decisions as you can
imagine he has since been arrested this
also no doubt helped game of Wars bottom
line quite a bit google has released
their top regular search trends for 2016
as you can imagine it sums up the year
pretty well you can find the expected
results like Hillary Clinton and Donald
Trump
along with Prince the Olympics David
Bowie and Pokemon go at the very top of
the list was Powerball which was worth a
mind-bending 1 point five six billion
dollars back in January apparently
everybody wanted to see how that turned
out
Super Mario run was released on iOS this
last week and there are tons of gameplay
videos on YouTube right now if you want
to see how it looks it's had a fairly
polarizing reception so far with some
praising the mobile centric gameplay
while others wish it adhere to older
Mario mechanics in either case you can
get it on iTunes right now Nintendo is
going to release the game on Android
however they have been a little quiet on
wind that will happen for right now
retro winter sports 1986 is a sports
game that is
comprised of six other minigames you'll
be able to play retro versions of ski
jump by Athlon bobsled speed skating
curling and slalom the graphics are as
you'd expect from a game with the word
retro in it you'll be able to play
against other people choose between 12
different nations to represent and
you'll have access to leaderboards and
achievements via google play games it's
a cheap game with no in-app purchases
events from Facebook is the latest arm
of Facebook to be spun off into its own
app this one handles all of your events
and it allows you to search for other
events that you may want to attend
you'll also be able to import calendars
from your phone to keep track of them as
well the interface is a bit clunky but
still usable and it's also worth noting
that the apps layout isn't all that
great either you can try it and it
should work for the most part however
don't expect the most enjoyable
experience just yet
Kathy Rayne is a puzzle adventure game
with a retro style you'll play as Kathy
a go-getter journalist who is
investigating the death of her
grandfather the journey is wrought with
peril and some emotional distress as a
player you'll follow a trail of clues
that will help lead you to the killer
the game features 40 hand-drawn
environments 40,000 lines of dialogue
and even voice acting it's a nice blend
of old and new and there are also no
in-app purchases netflix has officially
released their application for daydream
VR the good news is that it should work
with all of their video content the VR
experience puts you in a room with a TV
with Netflix playing on that TV it
actually looks pretty cool the bad news
is that the application is suffering
from some release bugs including
playback errors the UX could probably
use a little bit of work as well still
it does work most of the time and it's
worth a shot if you have daydream shadow
bug brush is an action platformer mixed
with an infinite runner you'll play as a
little silhouetted robot as you cut your
way through various enemies and levels
it features one finger controls
procedurally generated levels and dozens
of obstacles for you to overcome you'll
also have leaderboards and achievements
if you want those it's a freemium game
which isn't that great however it's a
good little time killer that looks nice
and plays well for even more Android
