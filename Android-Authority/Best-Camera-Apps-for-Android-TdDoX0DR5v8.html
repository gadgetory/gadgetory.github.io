the Android authority app guy do you
like to take pictures I know I do and
after the intro will show you some of
the best camera apps for Android first
on our list today is camera MX camera MX
like most of the third-party camera apps
on this list includes a lot of features
filters a fun user interface and even
some light photo editing features if
you're tired of the stock camera
offerings camera MX may be for you the
app offers a number of standard features
like zoom flash settings timer and video
mode to top that off there are a number
of filters that you can apply to
pictures it can range from something
nice like Lomo to something a little
goofy and fun like kaleidoscope or 8-bit
it may not be a great offering for pros
but for Instagram users it's pretty good
camera zoom FX takes a different
approach to photo manipulation while
many apps on this list have filters that
are a culmination of various effects
camera zoom FX lets you pick each effect
individually to create your own filter
or choose from a pre-made set of filters
for something quick and easy in addition
you can download plugins from the Google
Play Store to enhance camera zoom FX is
functionality as usual you get all the
standard features of any camera app
overall camera zoom FX felt like a more
complete camera replacement as it gives
users more control over their photos
camera 360 ultimate is not just a well
known and trusted camera replacement app
but it's also among the most popular
camera replacement apps on this list as
such it comes with all the standard
features and some pretty decent features
of its own unlike some apps on this list
you can't preview the effect to see how
it will turn out you'll have to pick
your filters and effects and then take
the picture and then the effects are
finally applied this seems a little
old-school since other apps can do this
but camera 360 ultimate makes up for it
by having a lot of features and filters
and an easy-to-use interface the next
step on our list camera is a little
different from other camera replacement
apps this one specializes in taking a
certain kind of picture namely portraits
so if you're one of those people who
take a lot of pictures with faces in it
then this app could be for you that said
camera does function quite well as a
regular camera it has the standard
features and even a few filters and
extra features to make regular pictures
look good its wheelhouse though is its
feature set that is specifically
tailored to pictures with faces in it
most of the apps on this list are good
for hobbyists but this one is actually
good for professional uses too let's
face facts here the internet just
wouldn't be the same without gifs
creating them as fun viewing them as fun
and they've been a
love internet hilarity for years now you
can create your own fairly easily with
jiff camera as the name implies the
camera is used to take a sequence of
shots which are then compiled together
to form a jiff you can create a shot of
something happening right in front of
you or you can create a collage with
pictures already in your gallery it's
quick it's easy and it's a lot of fun
Kotaku camera is unique in that it
doesn't really work as a standalone
camera however for fans of manga this
may be among the best cameras on the
list this camera has a number of unique
filters that you won't find anywhere
else
and the main one being that it turns any
picture into a manga picture in addition
to manga people can download a number of
other filters all of which have their
own themes from there you just shoot a
picture pick your theme pick a border
and you have a unique manga style
picture this is obviously for the
hobbyist and more so for hobbyists who
are into the anime culture but it's
still a popular and highly rated camera
app less than our list is pay per camera
this highly popular camera app doesn't
have the bells and whistles that a lot
of the apps on this list do but its
ability to take a unique picture has
endeared it to over a million downloader
so far and it's among the highest ranked
camera apps out there it includes only
one filter and that's the paper camera
filter however the filter can't be
customized quite a bit so you're not
taking the same kind of picture over and
over again it also takes video this way
as with many of these apps you can go
into your gallery and apply the filter
to a picture you've already taken it's
nice and simple and perfect if you want
to goof around a little if you take a
look at our leaderboard you can see how
all of these apps stack up against one
another
if you don't know our rating system
that's okay because we don't rate these
ourselves this is how you the people
have rated these apps in the Google Play
Store it's worth noting that all but two
of these applications scored a four
point four in the Google Play Store so
selecting a Best is pretty hard and
comes down mostly to personal taste also
an honorary mention goes out to the DSLR
controller app by chain fire it's not
exactly a camera replacement app but if
you want to control your DSLR camera
with your Android phone and take
pictures that way you should give that
up a closer look once again I'm Joe
