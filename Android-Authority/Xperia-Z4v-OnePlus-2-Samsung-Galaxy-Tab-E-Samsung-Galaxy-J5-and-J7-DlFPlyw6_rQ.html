brought to you by domain.com let's hear
it for Sony because they're trying to
claw their way back to relevancy you can
do it Sony once upon a time Sony could
do no wrong
it had a venerable army of top-notch
technology fast forward to 2015 and the
Sony that exists today is of a rather
different nature they've sold off their
laptop division their OLED division but
the company is still trying to stay out
of the red and has diversified into
insurance sales and banking at least in
Japan but the Xperia z4 v throws
everything into contention
it's a smartphone that has significant
changes not the least of which is a qHD
display along with wireless charging a
slightly larger battery though it is
thicker and heavier
yes but the Verizon exclusive is
everything that the standard z4 should
have been but is not the z4 V will ship
with the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 810
system on a chip three gigabytes of RAM
20.7 megapixel rear camera and a five
megapixel front-facing camera and the
same IP 65 and IP 68 ratings for water
and dust protection the most noticeable
change to the z4 v is the new 5.2 inch
qHD that's 2560 x 1440 pixel display
which is a step up from the 1080p
resolution found on the regular z4 the
z4 V also comes with a slightly larger
3000 milliamp hour battery compared with
the normal 29:30 milliamp hour battery
and features a dual mode key and PMA
wireless charging technology just like
the Samsung Galaxy s6 so where you guys
think hopefull excited or too little too
late now let's talk about the oneplus 2
that's rumored to launch next month do
you remember when the oneplus one was
about to be announced the company is
known for really hyping up their
products letting fans only catch bits
and pieces of information at a time
while the madness has begun just as
speculation and rumors had began to
swirl the oneplus 2 will launch with a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor on
board which also means it will tout the
powerful Adreno 430 GPU now oneplus
claims to
gone through plenty of testing with
other chips but kept coming back to the
Snapdragon 810 which has proven to be an
industry leader in speed multitasking
and superior battery life this chipset
will enable 4k video recording immersive
3d gaming great camera performance and
more there is one major complaint about
the Snapdragon 810 though and it seems
to be plagued by overheating issues at
least these are problems which have
shown up and other devices bearing the
same system on a chip but oneplus swears
this won't be an issue with oneplus 2
and that it will be quote cooler than
ever this is likely because they are
using the Snapdragon 810 version 2.1 and
this new chips improvements along with
hardware and software optimizations
should do the trick or at least we hope
so we can't confirm the specs just yet
but there's been a bevy of rumors
surrounding the topic it's said that the
device will come with three gigabytes of
RAM and either Full HD or q HD 5.5 inch
display some say there could be two
versions the price should start
somewhere between three hundred and
twenty two to four hundred US dollars
now for those of you seeking out an
affordable tablet Samsung is thinking of
you though maybe not very well last week
the Samsung Galaxy Tab II was leaked
packing relatively low end specs at
least according to the leaked
information now Samsung has gone and
made the device official at least for
the Taiwanese market the Galaxy Tab E is
powered by a 1.3 gigahertz quad-core
processor with 1.5 gigabytes of RAM
though Samsung has yet to specify what
exact CPU it is packing but for what
it's worth rumours previously pegged it
as touting a speed trum SC 7730 s key
turning to other specs you'll find a 9.6
inch LCD display with a resolution of
twenty eighty times eight hundred eight
gigabytes of storage microSD expansion
and a five thousand milliamp hour
battery and of course it runs 4.4 kitkat
a why ticket is more than a little dated
at this stage it is likely that lollipop
will simply not perform well enough with
these obviously low-end specs now let's
be frank at a $225 price point that's
not really the best deal in the world we
can think of a number of other options
that are a better bang for your buck
search our channel to find out Samsung
is clearly not taking my advice by only
focusing on the premium market because
now they have more mid-tier options for
all of us
Samsung has just quietly launched two
new mid-range smartphones the Galaxy j5
and the Galaxy j7 in China both handsets
are now available for purchase from
Samsung's website and will be aimed at a
younger crowd
other than sporting the familiar Samsung
design language these two devices have
another trick up their sleeves both
feature a front facing five megapixel
camera along with LED flash also on the
front of the device
now that selfie craze is in full circle
this feature will likely bring a lot of
younger users onboard hmm
do you think a 5 megapixel front facing
camera is gonna attract a younger crowd
I'm not feeling it the j5 on the other
hand comes with a 5-inch 720 display a
1.2 gigahertz quad-core Snapdragon 410
processor and a smaller 2600 milliamp
hour battery a bride to it's t-shirt

something that you guys would like to do

ask questions and comment and and be a
part of the process and possibly you
know if there's a good interaction I can
include that in the show so let me know

enough people who are interested then
I'll stream live I normally shoot late
