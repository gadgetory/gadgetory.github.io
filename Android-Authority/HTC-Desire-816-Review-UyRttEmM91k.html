Android Authority and typically when we
think of mid-range devices we think of
devices with lesser specs lesser
performance lesser build quality pretty
much lesser everything but HTC is
looking to redefine the mid-range game
with a device that doesn't necessarily
feel all that mid-range and that you can
still have a great device without the
latest and greatest specs this is the
htc desire 816 alright so before we dive
into the device itself let's go ahead
and do a quick unboxing and as you can
see is your typical HTC packaging that
we've become pretty used to by now but
inside the box you get the device
obviously and everything else is pretty
standard
you've got your micro USB charging cable
a wall adapter and the usual paperwork
unfortunately this phone doesn't include
any ear buds or any other extra
accessories but here is the desire 816
itself and in terms of build quality
this thing is very solidly constructed
it's a plastic unibody design with a
glossy back that can be pretty prone to
fingerprints and a matte finish on the
size in front which I thought would get
dirty pretty easily but it seems to have
held up pretty well so far it's no HTC
One m8 with its aluminum construction
but the desire 816 still feels very
premium and could give other major
flagship devices a run for their money
it is a pretty large phone and feels a
little bit slippery but it's probably no
bigger than a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 so
if you're used to phones that size you
shouldn't have any issues but it is
larger than the Nexus 5 and definitely
much larger than the Moto X despite its
size though it's a pretty thin phone
coming in at only seven point nine nine
millimeters on the top you've got your
3.5 milimeter headset jack with a noise
cancellation microphone your a microUSB
port on the bottom and then on the right
side is a pretty large flap that covers
your two SIM card slots so yes this is a
dual SIM device and then you've got your
micro SD card with support up to 128
gigs and then finally on the left is
your volume rockers and a pretty
awkwardly placed power button that took
some getting used to I like that HTC put
the
power button on the side but I would
have preferred it to be on the right
side or at least a little lower on the
chassis so I can easily power the phone
on without having to shuffle the device
in my hand if you didn't notice by now
on the front of the phone is HTC's
boomsound speakers which HTC made very
popular with a1 and trust me when I say
this there are no compromises here when
it comes to the speakers they're loud
and produce a very clean and crisp sound
with a nice amount of bass and the size
of the phone actually helps create a
nice stereo effect when watching videos
or listening to music and landscape
they're also very aesthetically pleasing
and have a pretty unique look to them so
the speakers are probably one of my
favorite parts about this phone also on
the front is that 5.5 inch display
coming in at 720p resolution and even
though this isn't the most high
resolution or pixel dense display it's
still a really nice looking display I
would say it's every bit as good as the
m8 - the resolution obviously but it's
got great colour reproduction great
viewing angles and pretty deep blacks
deep for an LCD anyways the bezels
around the display are pretty large and
you still get that bottom bar for a
dedicated HTC logo just like you do on
the One m8 but honestly it didn't really
bother me all that much or really
detract from the viewing experience
overall I really like this display and
it's great for media consumption like
watching movies and playing games specs
wise the desire 816 is rocking a
Snapdragon 400 processor clocked at 1.6
gigahertz backed by 1.5 gigabytes of RAM
and Adreno 305 GPU and 8 gigs of
internal storage no this doesn't have
the latest on the greatest specs but
with android 4.4 kitkat having lower
system requirements this thing doesn't
need it it's still plenty fast in
day-to-day usage and it seemed to handle
everything I threw at it with relative
ease apps open very quickly web browsing
performance was great and I had no
problems playing graphically intensive
games like Shadowgun deadzone or dead
trigger - so it's been a pretty smooth
and responsive experience so I really
have no complaints now onto another part
of this phone that I really like and
that is the 13 megapixel camera with
autofocus and LED flash and besides the
boom sound speakers the camera is
probably one of the best parts about
this phone the first thing you'll notice
is that this is not the new sense 6
that's not necessarily a bad thing the
sense 5 camera is still pretty good and
it will be very familiar terra-tory if
you've ever used the original HTC one it
doesn't have instant shutter but it's
still pretty quick and there's a lot of
shooting modes and options to really get
the shot that you're looking for it
takes really sharp looking photos and
that's such a high resolution your going
to be able to zoom and crop without
losing any detail which is really
important to a lot of people color
reproduction is great as photos come out
looking very nice and vibrant and it's
got pretty decent dynamic range for the
most part it does a pretty good job of
balancing out the lights and darks but
every once in a while you'll get that
shot where the lights are completely
blown out or everything gets lost in the
dark
at an aperture of f-22 though it does
have pretty good low-light performance
oh and that 5 megapixel front-facing
camera takes pretty decent selfies too
but overall I really like this camera
and dare I say it but I think many
people would have liked to see this in
the one m8
as far as the battery is concerned it is
a 2600 milliamp hour battery which
happens to be the same size as the One
m8 it is completely sealed in so you
can't remove it which isn't a big deal
to me but I was actually pretty
impressed with the battery life overall
on my first full day using it I got over
24 hours before I had to recharge it
which wasn't until early afternoon the
next day and I wasn't taking it easy on
this phone either I was doing my usual
stuff like checking social networks
texting browsing the web watching
YouTube listening to Google play music
and taking a lot of test shots on the
camera also just to really get an idea
of how good the camera is and the only
thing I really did to manage the battery
life was to keep my screen brightness
low but other than that I pretty much
just used it the same way I used any
other phone now onto the software and
the desire 816 is running on 4.4.2
kitkat which is the latest version of
Android with Sense 5 plus what you might
have figured out from the camera
software and it's got on-screen buttons
just like the m8 I was pretty surprised
to see that it wasn't running sense 6
especially considering at MWC HTC didn't
allow anyone to turn the phone on
because it was running new software and
it is it's running 4.4
cat but it's still running sense five
plus which we already saw on the
original HTC one but the experience here
is pretty much exactly the same as the
one lineup you still get Zoe's video
highlights and blinkfeed
which I actually wasn't able to use
because all the new sources were
actually in Chinese if you're wondering
about connectivity this phone does
support HSPA+ and LTE but you'll want to
be careful as there are two different
models floating around out there there's
one made for European and Middle Eastern
markets and then there's one made
specifically for China which is the one
that I have here and they both support
slightly different bands I'm currently
using this phone on
t-mobile's network and I do get HSPA+
but I don't get LTE so if you don't mind
using HSPA+ then you shouldn't have any
problems using this phone on t-mobile or
ATT's networks and if you're looking to
get one for yourself the desire 816 can
be found for 370 to 400 euros and in the
United States the only place I've
managed to find it so far is on eBay for
a little over $400 which honestly isn't
that bad of a price for the phone that
you are getting so there you have it for
the desire 816 overall I really like
this phone and although it's considered
mid-range I never really felt that way
my entire time using it it's got great
build quality a great display you still
get HTC's boomsound speakers and it's
got a pretty awesome camera too but
that's pretty much it hopefully you guys
enjoyed this video and if you did don't
forget to give it a thumbs up and also
