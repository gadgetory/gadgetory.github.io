comes around with its world's first
triple camera system there's only one
thing anyone wants to talk about and for
good reason of the 3 p 20 variants only
the P 20 Pro has three cameras the
regular P 20 offers much the same
experience as the P 20 pro but it lacks
the third telephoto lens meaning some
camera features aren't available unless
you ante up for the pro do so however
and you'll also get a larger OLED screen
more RAM better water resistance and a
bigger battery too you'll also get a
while wave phone that for the first time
I'm comfortable in saying is a better
buy than the latest Galaxy phone the
first thing you need to know about this
phone is that yes the cameras are
absolutely worth it they're not perfect
then they take some getting used to but
they're pretty fantastic will cover the
other stuff like software and
performance later but the p20 pro is all
about those cameras so that's where
we're starting thanks to the presences
of AI in the p20 pro camera it has a
kind of split personality that you're
going to have to get to know both sides
of if you really want to get the best
results out of it in the my 10 pro
review I made a joke about meeting your
new Aoi overlord and the same is true
here the AI and the p20 pro camera has a
very particular idea about photography
and you'll occasionally find yourself
butting heads with it that's because it
can recognize 19 different scenes and
automatically adjust the camera settings
this can be great in some situations
like when it bumps the saturation of
grass or a blue sky but sometimes it's
kind of like arguing with a friend about
whether or not Instagram filters are a
good thing so there's a constant
balancing act between how you think
photos should look the photos the
hardware actually takes and then how the
AI think things should be tweaked the
p20 pro has an 8 megapixel telephoto
lens up top a 40 megapixel RGB lens
below that and a 20 megapixels
monochrome lens at the bottom the 3x
zoom lens has an aperture of f28 for
while the main lens gets a little wider
at F 1.8 and the black-and-white lens is
even wider again at F 1.6 but the P 20
pros photography chops also come down to
its massive one 1/7 of an inch sensor
size and the largest since the Nokia
1020 main igb sensor has one micron
pixels that Huawei makes into 2 micron
pixels via a process called pixel
binning
this means the light information from
the color filters on four adjacent
pixels are combined to provide for time
to lie
data as you may have realized that drops
a resolution of the main sensor from 40
megapixels down to 10 megapixels which
is a default setting on the p20 Pro you
can of course still shoot of 40
megapixels when you want but at full
resolution the smaller pixels are less
sensitive to light than the 2x2 version
so you'll only want to shoot a 40
megapixels in very well-lit conditions
you also can't zoom in when shooting at
40 megapixels so keep that in mind
now you may rightfully ask why why we
wouldn't just use 2 micron pixels in the
first place like HTC did with the One m8
the answer is versatility pixel binning
gives you great low-light performance at
10 megapixels but also really fine
detail in good lighting at 40 megapixels
and we all know that bigger numbers go a
long way towards selling both phones and
cameras the monochrome sensor also helps
absorbing three times as much light
information as RGB because it has no
color filters to deal with that means
more detail increased light sensitivity
and less noise and shadows in an RGB
sensor put these two sensors together
though and you get richly colored and
finely detailed shots with excellent
low-light performance rounding things
out is the 3x optical telephoto lens
based on the resolution of each lens you
might think that jumping to the
telephoto would reduce the images from
the max of 40 megapixels to just 8
megapixels however even at 3 times zoom
you still get a 10 megapixel result
that's because the p20 pro is still
using all three cameras the p20 pro also
features a five times hybrid zoom using
both the 3x optical lens and over
sampling to take things a little further
digitally the results are quite
impressive with details in a 5x shot
looking pretty indistinguishable from a
cropped 3x shot they're not as good as
they would be from a 5x optical zoom but
it's nice to know you can digitally zoom
in a bit and still maintain image
quality you can actually zoom all the
way into 10x on the p20 pro but I
wouldn't advise it the zoom lens is the
only one with OAS here but all three
benefit from what Huawei calls AIS or
AOA image stabilization which you can
easily see kicking in after a second or
two while it comes in handy when taking
still photos it's mind blowing when it
comes to shooting video the vertical
stabilization is incredible as you can
see here with very few bumps but the p20
Pro sort of grabs onto things in the
frame horizontally resulting in sort of
jumping movements as you turn the camera
sideways hopefully this can be addressed
in an update to make it smoother on all
axes to see how a is compares with EAS
on the pixel - I did a quick lap on the
back of a bike over a bumpy path and you
can see the results of yourself
iOS is also responsible for what I think
is the biggest highlight of the p20 pro
camera and that's for second handheld
long exposures at night anyone that's
ever tried shooting a low-light long
exposure by hand would know it's a bit
of a mug's game but the AIS stabilizes
the image enough that you get incredibly
crisp blur free shots combine this with
the excellent low-light sensitivity and
detail of the three senses and the
results are pretty phenomenal you can
grab the full res photos in the
description below if you want to have a
closer look
shots taken tonight look very exciting
on the p20 display it's only when you
start pixel peeping on a computer that
you see where they start to fall down
but this raises an important question
what do you consider to be a good photo
photographers will say it's the one that
maintains integrity under scrutiny but
nowadays most would probably say it's
the one that looks best on social media
and Huawei has very much sided with that
attitude there's basically no noise and
things look great on your phone but up
close most of the images you see here
either exhibit over sharpening or
smudgey smoothing that makes the end
result look more like an oil painting
than a photograph but like the artist
that can create a likeness of a human
face with a few strokes of the brush or
pen so too can Huawei's image processing
produce what on the surface looks to be
a nicely detailed face in the dark other
phones like a pixel too will maintain
that detail but lose sharpness due to
blurred edges noise a natural image
degradation in bad lighting as viewed on
a smartphone though the Huawei p20 Pro
Shop probably looks better so you tell
me who has the right approach this is
where the p20 pro is going to divide its
audience unfortunately the 24 megapixel
front facing camera produces slightly
soft selfies and even with Beauty mode
turned off completely there's still a
noticeable smoothness that really
shouldn't be there
selfies are less contrast II and more
overexposed than those from the main
camera although in good conditions you
can get nicely detailed and balanced
shots like this with such a reflective
back panel though you can easily flip
the camera around and learn how to use
your reflection to frame a perfect
selfie instead
portrait mode works both on the front
and the back of the p20 probe but even
though there's three lenses on the back
I still found the results to be a bit
hit or miss software assisted bokeh just
can't accurately handle the cutout on
unruly hair like mine without it looking
artificial although on easier targets it
performed quite well if you ask me
though you're probably better off just
using the p20 zap urchin mode to take
selfies with because at least then you
can control the amount of fake bokor in
the shot or remove it entirely if it
looks too silly aperture mode offers up
to a simulated F 0.95 AI scene
recognition in the p20 pro means that
anytime you get a human face in the
frame it'll automatically enable
portrait mode the same is true for night
mode open the camera at night and it'll
often switch settings this is where the
AI can start to get in the way because
there's already a dedicated mode for
both of those settings so if I wanted
either of those I'd switch to them
myself the good news about Scene
Recognition is that it's all optional
you can deny AI suggestions as they come
up or completely disable scene
recognition via the camera settings some
of the AI settings are great while
others are a bit over the top but you'll
quickly learn which suggestions to keep
and which to ditch making on-the-fly
photography a little more consistent one
of the other big deals of the p20 is iso
up to a hundred and two thousand four
hundred while this helps the p20 in
low-light situations to a degree if you
check the exif data for the vast
majority of your nighttime shots you'll
see it doesn't go anywhere near that
because you end up with so much grain it
ruins the photos photographers know this
and Huawei knows this so you can't
manually select anything above ISO 3200
in Pro Mode in truly dark situations
where the ISO does get bumped up to 100k
the results are a good example of why
it's sometimes just too dark to make it
worth taking a photo if you need to read
some food labels when the powers out be
my guest but most folks will never want
or need ISO anywhere near that high on
their phone in good lighting the p20
probe performs just as good as you'd
expect it to with accurate colors sharp
detail contrast the exposure and
excellent dynamic range while no mode
typically only makes a big difference in
really low light because the auto mode
is just that good it does work nicely as
an HDR replacement when shooting a high
contrast shot with a bright light source
the 4d predictive tracking works
relatively well but I still found the
autofocus struggle to stay locked onto
leaves or flowers blowing in the wind
the AOA framing feature whereby the
phone helps you to compose better shots
or prompts you to adjust your
positioning to better capture a group of
people for example didn't work at all
for me during testing ultra snapshot
mode which instantly fires the shutter
even when the phone screen is off is
only able to shoot a seven megapixel
photo in eighteen to nine aspect ratio
and there's no way to change that in
settings because of the speed with which
the shot is taken you also won't get the
benefits of AI scene recognition here
but you can always just remap the
shortcut to open the camera app instead
when it comes to video the p20 supports
960 frames per second slow motion video
capture while it's definitely fun and
easy enough to get the timing right
you'll occasionally see weird artifacts
in the resulting video and the HD
resolution isn't high enough to make it
really useful for most content creators
there's also 120 frames per second
option at 1080p and 240 FPS at 720p the
p20 pro can also shoot 4k at 30 frames
per second and Full HD video at both 30
and 60 what all this boils down to is
simple the why away p20 pro has all the
hardware and software you'll ever need
to get fantastic shots in almost all
lighting conditions using it in auto
mode is a bit of a misnomer though as
the AI frequently takes over and changes
things in ways you may not always like
once you accustom yourself to what
you're willing to let the AI handle and
what you'd rather tackle on your own
you're in to a real treat though
assuming you agree with our Huawei
processes images in the first place if
you don't the pixel 2 is probably the
phone for you of course there's a lot
more to this phone than just the camera
but comparatively speaking the rest of
it is nowhere near as exciting even if
it's all just as good the p20 pro has an
excellent 6.1 inch OLED panel and yes it
does have a notch for those that really
hate notches there's a software setting
for camouflaging it but either way the
p20 pro display is really good the
smaller p20 also has an arch but it
comes with a 5.8 inch LCD instead last
year's Kirin 9:17 chipset with Huawei's
neural processing unit lies under the
hood and it comes with 6 gig of ram and
128 gig of storage but while they're
still a dual SIM card slot you can no
longer use a second space for expandable
storage
now performance testing the p20 Pro
bested the competition in almost every
benchmark firing the Galaxy S nine we
scored almost otherworldly results based
on the snapdragon 845 and the Exynos 98
10 you'll have to wait until the next
mate device to see just how good while
weighs 2018 performance can get the p20
Pro has an ip67 water resistance rating
and the best color option on our
smartphone I've seen since the
Stormtrooper Edition Nexus 5 if for some
reason you can't get the Twilight color
here there's also a black or blue option
as well as a gradient pink and gold
colorway as USB type-c earbuds in the
box along with a 3.5 ml are for your
existing wired headphones don't be at
most support and stereo speakers that
support for Sony Zelda Kodak and Hwa
audio over Bluetooth 4.2 if wireless
headphones are more your thing Budi on
the p20 pro whether via speakers
headphones what bluetooth was always
reliable enjoyable and better than most
the p20 pro runs Android 8.1 Oreo with a
slightly refined emui
8.1 it still feature packed and pretty
convoluted but you'll likely already
know how much of a deal-breaker emui it
is for you as with the may 10 pro pc
mode is still possible via nothing more
than a USB C to HDMI cable but if you
want to use your phone as a computer for
longer than a single battery cycle
you'll just need a powered USB hub
there's also a new face unlock feature
that is insanely fast and that works
incredibly well even in really dark
environments had no idea just how secure
it is compared to the likes of face ID
but face unlocking is typically less
secure than fingerprint scanners which
the p20 pro keeps just below the display
this means unlocking the phone wallets
face up is possible but you will get
some wobble thanks to the off-center
camera bump the fingerprint scanner can
be used as a navigation gesture pad as
well allowing you to remove the
on-screen navigation buttons to open up
even more usable on-screen space while
the gestures themselves are easy enough
to get used to I personally have no
issue with virtual buttons so I left
them where they are if you think they're
a waste of space though it's good to
have the option to get rid of them
the p20 Pro comes with a four thousand
milliamp hour battery that depending on
your usage habits will basically last
forever
despite the switch to a glass back on
the p20 Pro there's unfortunately no
wireless charging but the 4.5 volt 5 mm
Huawei super charged brick will get you
fully topped up in just 19 minutes per
milliamp hour the p20 Pro charge is the
fastest of any phone we've ever tested
except for the p20 with its smaller 3400
milliamp hour battery and ever so
slightly faster charging rate the p20
Pro even outperformed the mate 10 Pro
which we crowned the best smartphone
battery in 2017 according to our testing
the Huawei P 20 pro has the best battery
on any smartphone around right now so if
I said to say the p20 pro battery is not
something you need to worry about but
neither is performance or design or
audio quality or connectivity or specs
or build quality while we've been
nailing those cornerstones for ages and
they've only improved in the p20 pro
everything about this phone is so solid
and the camera is so compelling the only
real question is is it enough to
properly challenge the likes of Samsung
and Apple from a technical standpoint
the answer is absolutely yes but from a
branding and availability standpoint the
answer is undeniably no but the very
fact that Huawei is facing such an
uphill battle especially in the US is
part of the reason the company will stop
at nothing to prove that they can make
phones that are equal to if not better
than the best in the world with an 899
euro price tag the p20 Pro is priced in
the same tier as the galaxy s 9 and
iPhone 8 and there's no denying it has
just as much to offer than either of
those phones nowhere near as many people
will buy it of course but for what it's
worth they absolutely should want to and
there's only so long that while we can
keep pushing the boundaries until Apple
and Samsung fans are forced to take
notice
Huawei knows it's facing a drawn-out
battle to get there but the p20 Pro is a
great lead towards achieving that goal
as always thank you so much for watching
