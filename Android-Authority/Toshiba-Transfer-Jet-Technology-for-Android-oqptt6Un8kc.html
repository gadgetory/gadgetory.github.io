and we're here with the con folks from
Toshiba they have some really great
technology coming up here called
transfer jet really really hot bandwidth
really low power envelope lower than
bluetooth is a close close connection
the devices themselves have to touch
like this but we can transfer 360
megabits up to 400 a curve it's a second
it really looks like it has the
potential to revolutionize how we
transfer me to aim between devices so
let's just look at a quick demo over
here ok we're going to transfer a video
clip okay from one device to another so
I'm going to pick this video clip here
and just say send touch it here
just got transferred there and you can
see they did play automatically there
you go just playing their best thing in
beating yeah okay
you stopped it outside of that
it was playing now okay such as I hope
that's okay so this is the idea is to
show that how quickly we can transfer to
other example is we just took the video
of our interview here and we're going to
put it on the laptop here and you see
how quickly the transfer so again this
is using transfer gate technology
we do sleep alone
just by touch commissioner
just to give you a sense this is a chip
and this is our equipment it's coming to
Android before I phone everyone that's
for sure thank you yeah yeah thank you
very much thank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
