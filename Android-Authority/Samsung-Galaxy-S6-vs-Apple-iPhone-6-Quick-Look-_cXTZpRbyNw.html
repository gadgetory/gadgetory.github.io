particular versus at MWC 2015 but
perhaps with what Samsung has done with
their brand new flagship smartphone this
is more relevant than ever it's Joshua
regard from Android authority what's
going on everybody and this is the
Samsung Galaxy s6 versus the Apple
iPhone 6 samsung has promised an upgrade
in the design language for the brand new
Galaxy S a smartphone and that's exactly
what they brought us probably the change
that we have been waiting for now we do
say that there are some influences
obviously being had here and now that we
are looking at the iPhone 6 versus the
galaxy s6 we will say it they do look a
little bit similar especially since the
metal around the rim happens to have a
thinness that's very similar to the
iPhone 6 but it's influences also come
from the Galaxy Note 4 especially
considering these small edges that are
raising up on the top and bottom of that
metal frame for the Galaxy s6 and the
only real similarity that makes it
pretty striking is on the bottom where
you see the microUSB charging port the
headphone jack and even the speaker
grille on the bottom but nonetheless the
Galaxy S six now has a metal frame and a
glass panel construction on the front
and the back and it is actually quite
thin like I mentioned already but also
very lights making it one of the better
handling galaxy s6 devices out there and
if you go to around the back
the main difference here with the
Samsung Galaxy s6 from previous
iterations is its glass backing of
course but it's also not removable more
of a unibody design is found here much
like in the iPhone 6 but also it's
camera on the s6 is protruding out quite
a lot it might be a bit of a problem for
those of you who like to slide your
phones around on tables for example Paul
has always had some pretty great designs
and Samsung finally offers a flagship
with a design language a material choice
that does stand true to its high-end
nature and it's probably the change that
you have been waiting for even if it
looks pretty similar in this particular
verses of course considering where we
are in the smartphone market today it's
no surprise that both of these phones
and their sixth iterations are trying to
up the ante in display technology the
iPhone 6 now comes with a 4.7 inch IPS
LCD display that has a resolution of
1334 by 750 resulting in a pixel density
of 326
API now Android is somewhat moving
beyond the 1080p space and going into
the quad HD space and that's exactly
what the galaxy s6 does with a quad HD
display that at 5.1 inches has a pixel
density of 577 which is pretty insane
Super AMOLED though continues to offer
what we love about it from previous
iterations very deep blacks vibrant
colors that look even more vivid on this
even higher resolution display and from
what we've seen so far we really do
enjoy it the iPhone 6 is display also
gets some pretty good marks but with its
lower resolution if you are looking to
keep up in the spec war well then you're
probably going to end up picking the
galaxy s6 because it just simply Trump's
the iPhone 6 display in terms of its
sheer pixel density as always a
by-the-numbers look isn't quite too fair
when comparing these two devices from
two different ecosystems that provide
very different performance experiences
that being said the iPhone 6 offers an
a8 chip which comprises a dual-core
processor clocked in at 1.4 gigahertz
and is back to buy one gigabyte of RAM
but on the other hand the galaxy s6 is
going to set a precedent in the in the
sense that it is not sporting a qualcomm
chipset like many probably expected but
instead Samsung is going to globally
release this phone with Anik ceno's
processor backed by three gigabytes of
RAM an in-house processor that they are
optimizing for their software and as
such we should pretty much expect
fantastic performance from the Galaxy s6
and that is exactly what we had in our
short time playing with the phone
another hardware the iPhone 6 is
available in 32 64 and 128 gigabyte
flavors but that is also going to be the
case for the galaxy s6 which now does
not come with a removable back at which
you will not be able to expand the
memory or be able to replace the battery
despite the significant difference on
paper both processing packages do a
great job in handling their respective
experiences and fans of either have had
nothing to complain about in terms of
this particular aspect of this versus
because both ego systems still provide
very good performance no matter which
one they have in the camera Department
Apple stays away from the megapixel race
that dominates the Android world with
the iPhone 6 featuring a 8 megapixel
rear shooter the same as its predecessor
but with some improvements across the
board the better sensor and autofocus
system called focus pixels and a
software based image stabilization video
gets a boost as
well with 720p slow-motion video being
captured at 240 frames per second the
front-facing camera has AF 2.2 lens with
a burst mode in HDR video but now the
galaxy s6 has a 16 megapixel rear camera
and a 5 megapixel front-facing camera
both of which have F 1.9 aperture and
they also come with on both sides an
auto live HDR mode now Samsung has been
able to create some pretty incredible
cameras in the past for the Android
world and we're expecting it to be even
better on this new iteration of the
Galaxy S line we won't really have any
real comparisons in terms of pictures
until we get our hands on our own galaxy
s6 at which time I will probably do a
big camera shootout to see which of
these cameras really provide the better
experience for the user and finally in
software we're taking a look at two
different ecosystems like I said before
at which time I also said that the
performance on either of these devices
should be good for the users who decide
on which one they want to back that
being said iOS 8 remains aesthetically
similar to iOS 7 but introduces a few
new features like Apple pay to take
advantage of an NFC chip improvements to
iCloud a health app some improved
notifications with its own version of
the drop-down and the ability to
third-party keyboards but ultimately it
still looks like iOS has looked for many
years now at this point and many of the
users who flock to iPhone will have a
very familiar experience when going
through their ecosystem on the other
hand Samsung provided a look at their
brand new TouchWiz which is an updated
version with lollipop as the backend and
you will see that change in the
notification drop-down and also in the
recent apps screen but in the little
time that we were able to mess with the
galaxy s6 we didn't really find too many
extras in the little presentation that
we got for it I actually didn't find
myself accidentally triggering any of
the many features that would have been
on the let's say galaxy s5 or the note 4
after it and - for the most part the
lollipop additions were really the only
real aesthetic changes that were
happening here what we really did see is
the fact that this version of TouchWiz
might have been dialed back to the point
where its performance is kind of through
the roof especially one optimized with
the X n O's chip that is inside I really
had a hard time making it
stutter on me the way that it was easy
to do so on other Samsung devices and on
the galaxy s6 we're really hoping that
TouchWiz despite having all of the
features that it does and we're not
saying that it doesn't have those
features we just didn't really mess with
a lot of them we'll be able to perform
faster than any other iteration from
before and that will put it on par with
the performance aspect that iPhone users
have always enjoyed with their
particular ecosystem in iOS and so there
you have it for this quick look at the
Samsung Galaxy s6 versus the Apple
iPhone 6 these six iterations in these
two respective ecosystems bring a lot of
enhancements to their lines not only in
design display and especially in
performance with two different operating
systems being backed by in-house
processing packages at this point but
also from a camera experience that
hopefully will yield a very
great-looking photos I will have a full
versus not only on the camera but on all
the aspects between these two especially
since their similarities are starting to
get a little bit more pronounced and we
will see which one of these two phones
light and metal-clad are going to be
better for you so keep it tuned to
Android authority for all of the best
coverage and stay tuned for even more
from Mobile World Congress in Barcelona
