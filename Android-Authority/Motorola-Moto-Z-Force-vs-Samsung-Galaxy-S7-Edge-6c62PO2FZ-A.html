thority and today we're taking a look at
two of the hottest smartphones on the
market right now with the Moto Z and the
galaxy s7 edge the Moto Z is completely
different from anything we've ever seen
from Motorola and it brings something
very unique to the table with this moto
mods but how does it stack up to
arguably one of the best and most well
rounded smartphones from Samsung with
the s7 edge now something to keep in
mind with this comparison is there is a
forced edition of the Moto Z which has a
few key differences and I'll point out
what those are as we go through this
comparison kicking things off with the
design and build quality both of these
phones are made of some very high
quality materials look fantastic and
feel extremely sturdy the Moto G is made
of a combination of glass on the front
and back with a smooth metal frame
holding it all together the corners have
been rounded off to make it feel more
comfortable to hand and there is a
subtle curve with the front glass but
for the most part this phone is
completely flat on the front and back
with the only exception being that large
protruding camera lens the galaxy s7
edge is also made of glass and metal but
unlike the Moto Z you have curves pretty
much everywhere from the tapers on the
backside the rounded corners and the
curved edge front glass it's one of the
most solid and comfortable feeling
phones that Samsung has ever made and
overall it's just a very sleek and
eye-catching design the camera lens on
the s7 does protrude just slightly but
it's nowhere near as drastic as the Moto
Z and from most angles it's not even
noticeable the downside to a phone made
predominantly of glasses that it makes
it a complete fingerprint magnet so you
either have to deal with cleaning it on
a regular basis or use a skin or a case
with the Moto Z you can take advantage
of the moto mods and slap on a style
shell cover to give the phone a little
bit of extra Flair and it also adds
enough thickness to hide that camera
bulge while we're on the subject of moto
mods we might as well talk about them
right now there's only a few like the
JBL speaker the projector and the
incipio power pack but there should be
more coming as more third-party
manufacturers jump on board and create
these modal mods these motor mods are
definitely the biggest selling point to
buying a motor Z and if you like how
they work and the extra functionality
that they add then you'll probably like
them just keep in mind that they're not
exactly cheap and all of them at
difficut amount of thickness of the
phone by itself demoted Z is extremely
thin at a hair over five millimeters and
it's very impressive how thin Motorola
managed to make this phone the Moto G
force on the other hand is slightly
thicker at seven millimeters but it's
still a very thin phone you really have
to hold it in your hand to truly
appreciate it but despite how thin the
Moto Z is it's actually larger than the
s7 edge in every other dimension and has
a much bigger footprint even though they
share identical screen sizes at 5.5
inches samsung has managed to make the S
of an edge a much more compact phone by
having a smaller top and bottom chin
thinner bezels and curving down the
glass on the left and right sides both
of these phones carry a microSD card
slot for expandable storage which is
always a very useful feature to have but
where you'll notice a huge difference is
on the bottom the Moto Z has a USB
type-c port whereas the s7 edge has a
micro USB port but the s7 edge has a
headphone jack while Motorola chose not
to include one on the Moto Z which means
you'll have to use an adapter with your
headphones the Moto Z does have a better
sounding speaker and it's located on the
front of the phone which is a much
better location than Samsung's bottom
firing speaker but if we're being
perfectly honest here neither one of
these speakers are that impressive but
you have the JBL speaker to make up for
this deficiency on the Moto Z the
speaker on the s7 edge is also very
muffled and distorted due to the
built-in water and dust resistance but I
think most people will agree that this
is a small price to pay to have this
type of protection on their phone the
Moto Z is also water resistant but it
doesn't carry an IP rating like the s7
does this means that the motive II can
survive a splash or a small spill but it
won't survive being submerged like I
mentioned earlier both the Moto Z NSM
edge are rocking a 5.5 inch display and
they're both AMOLED screens with a
resolution of 2560 by 1440 this gives
off a very high pixel density making
them both super sharp and they're both
very vibrant saturated and full of deep
inky blacks the s7 edge screen is just a
tad brighter and has slightly better
viewing angles but otherwise they're
very comparable displays and media like
games and YouTube videos look absolutely
fantastic on them one benefit to the SM
Edge is that it also has an always-on
display which lights up only the
necessary pixels to let you see
important information like the time date
life the calendar and notifications the
motives e doesn't have an always-on
display but it does have something very
similar with moto display which is still
one of the best features to ever grace
Android it'll periodically pulsate
anytime you have notifications or you
can manually wake it by picking up the
phone or simply waving your hand over it
another thing worth mentioning is if you
happen to have the motors we force
you're also getting a shatterproof
display that's much more durable over
these standard Gorilla Glass displays of
the Moto Z and the s7 edge sitting right
below the displays of the Moto Z and the
s7 edge are the fingerprint sensors but
the main difference between these two
fingerprint sensors is that the s7
doubles as a home button whereas the
Moto Z's does not regardless of how much
you want to treat it like one as far as
accuracy and reliability they both work
extremely well but the Moto sees is
going to feel a tad bit quicker since
its fingerprint sensor starts reading
your print the second you touch it while
on the s7 you have to press down the
home button first before it starts
reading your prints even though the Moto
Z's fingerprint sensor is not a home
button it does function as a lock key to
put the phone back to sleep which I
personally think is a really nice touch
like every other flagship that has come
out this year the Moto Z and the s7 edge
are packing identical specs with a
Snapdragon 820 and four gigabytes of RAM
I won't harp on the performance too much
but these are both blazing fast phones
and can handle anything you throw at
them from web browsing multitasking and
high-end games despite offering two very
different Android experiences they're
both very fluid bones and you'd be
hard-pressed to notice much of a
difference between the two as far as
battery life goes the Moto Z has a 2600
milliamp hour battery while on the s7
edge you're looking at a much larger
3600 milliamp hour battery but the
playing field is a little more even if
you're comparing the Moto G force which
has a 3500 milliamp hour battery
obviously better life is going to vary
based on usage and the Moto Z can get
through a full day or you're going to be
able to do that much more comfortably on
the Moto Guzzi force and the s7 edge
most these phones do have fast charging
so they're very easy to fill up and in
the case of the SMA edge you also have
fast wireless charging but if you really
want to extend the Moto Z's battery life
it's as easy as slapping on the incipio
power pack which to me is currently the
most useful and practical moto mod on
the market taking a look at the cameras
you won't find anything too crazy going
on here like a dual lens setup but
you will find is a 13-megapixel rear
shooter with F 1.8 aperture optical
image stabilization and a dual tone LED
flash on the Moto Z if you have the
motor Z forces bumps up to 21 megapixels
but everything else remains the same the
s7 or s7 edge comes with a 12 megapixel
sensor F 1.7 aperture optical image
stabilization and a blazing fast dual
pixel auto focusing system that allows
that focus much faster than any other
smartphone camera currently on the
market the motor sees camera software
keeps things pretty simple by only
offering the most basic of camera modes
whereas the s7 gives you a very of
options with different modes and camera
effects but both cameras do offer manual
controls if I had to pick either one of
these cameras I definitely go with the
s7 edge the Moto Z can take some decent
photos but it really pales in comparison
to the s7 the s7 s photos are sharper
and more detailed with better dynamic
range whereas the Moto Z has the
tendency to overexpose and blow out
highlights the s7 s camera is also the
much faster camera overall and low-light
the Moto Z is really slow to capture
especially if you're using HDR while the
s7 is still really fast to focus and
capture photos thanks to that dual pixel
autofocus the s7 does have some troubles
with white balance in low-light but the
photos are still much more detailed over
the photos of the Moto Z one of the best
parts about Motorola phones is that they
keep the software experience pretty
close to stock the Moto Z is running
Android marshmallow and it says close to
stock as you're going to get without
being a nexus Motorola customizations to
Android also keeps things pretty light
but they're also some of the most useful
features we've ever seen on an Android
phone of course you have motor display
which I mentioned earlier but you also
have things like moto voice to call upon
your Moto Z from across the room and the
various moto actions like the double
shot to turn on the camera flash and the
ever so useful double twist of the wrist
to launch the camera the only real
downside with the Moto Z being a verizon
exclusive at the moment is that it comes
with a crap-ton of Verizon bloatware and
a bunch of other pre-installed games and
apps there's an unlocked version coming
soon which won't have any of this
bloatware but it's something that you'll
have to deal with if you decide to jump
on the mosey right now the s7 edge is
also running Android marshmallow but it
has Samsung's usual touch with skin
which changes a lot of the look and feel
of Android but Samsung has done a better
job with it recently and it's a much
cleaner and less bloaty experience than
it has been a year
pass with the s7 edge you also have the
edge panels that can give you quick
access to apps sports scores the weather
your contacts and a variety of other
shortcuts just by swiping in from the
edge glass they can be useful but like
many other new features on a smartphone
you have to train yourself to get use of
them or else you'll just forget about
them the Moto Z and the s7 edge are two
really fantastic smartphones in their
own right
but what it's really going to come down
to is how much you value moto mods and
how easily you can get your hands on one
of these smart phones the s7 edge is the
easier phone to get right now with
availability on all carriers but if you
really want the Moto Z and you can't
hold out for the unlock version
verizon is currently your only option
the Moto Z is a very solid smartphone on
its own and the Moto mods is just icing
on the cake it's a very elegant way of
modifying your smartphone and if you're
willing to spend the extra money you
won't be disappointed the s7 edge
doesn't have any crazy bells and
whistles or extra moving parts but it is
an all-around great smart phone that
ticks all the right boxes and for most
people that's going to be more than
enough to suit their needs but let us
