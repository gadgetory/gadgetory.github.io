brought to you by the LG g3 hey what is
going on guys lon here from Android
authority and the NOC code is one of
LG's most popular feature and we first
saw this on the G pro 2 and subsequently
on other devices like the g2 and the G
flex through a software update so today
we're gonna be taking a look at the NOC
code what it does and how you can set it
up on your LG g3 so here is my LG g3 and
if you don't know what NOC code is it
essentially is a form of security for
your lockscreen
but instead of typing in a PIN number or
drawing a pattern the NOC code is a
series of taps on a 2x2 grid and
basically you just sort of imagine the
grid on the screen and enter the pattern
of taps or knocks that you've created
unlike entering a pin or drawing a
pattern though you don't have to wake up
the display in order for it to work you
can actually enter your NOC code even
when your phone is completely asleep so
in that regard it's a little bit faster
and saves you the additional step of
having to wake up your phone first in
order to do it another thing to take
note of is the 2x2 grid isn't defined to
any particular size so you can imagine
the grid to be as large as you want or
as small as you want all that really
matters is that you get the series of
taps in the right order and if you
entered the NOC code correctly your g3
should automatically unlock and get you
right into the OS setting it up is
really easy and takes maybe a minute or
two first open up settings by pulling
down the notification shade and tapping
on the Settings icon swipe over to the
display tab and tap on lock screen and
then select screen lock from here you
just tap on the NOC code and this is
where you will set up your NOC code
you'll see that it requires a minimum of
three taps with a maximum of 8 and you
can make it as simple or as complex as
you want obviously the more taps and the
more complicated you make your NOC code
the more secure it is for the sake of
demonstration I'm gonna make mine very
simple but once you've entered your code
just hit continue and it'll prompt you
to put it in one more time but once
you've done that just hit confirm and
just in case you ever forget your
not code it's going to ask you to set up
a pin as a backup so I'm just gonna
enter 1 2 3 4 just to keep it simple and
hit continue
enter your PIN one more time hit OK and
now your not code should be set so just
make sure it works properly just go
ahead and lock your phone and give it a
try and if you did it correctly it
should wake up and unlock your LG g3 but
other than that I think the NOC code is
a really awesome way to keep your phone
secure and it's extremely quick and
convenient but that is it for this video
