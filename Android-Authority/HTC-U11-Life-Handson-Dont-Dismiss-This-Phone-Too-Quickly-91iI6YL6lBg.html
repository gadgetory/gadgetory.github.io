version of a flagship device well that's
exactly the kind of question that HTC
wants to address with a more affordable
in thus more accessible version of their
flagship you 11 it's Joshua Vergara
what's going on everybody and this is
the HTC u 11 life and I've been using it
for the last few days quick disclosure I
have had the U 11 life for a little bit
now and though I was initially prepared
to give a more casual take on what is
basically a phone that tries to emulate
its flagship original it slowly but
surely became obvious that I needed to
give it a closer look and that's because
the HTC u 11 life started to succeed now
two versions of the HTC u 11 life are
going to be available in different parts
of the world the original version that
you're seeing in my footage is the
version that has HTC software and
additions but there is going to be a
global Edition that runs Android 1 that
version of course will not use all of
the different software editions from HTC
and instead has a very lean version of
stock Android it is also going to be
made to a much wider audience while the
HTC u 11 life that I am using will be
available in the US and will be on
t-mobile at some point moving forward
now some parts of the U 11 life are
obvious downgrade from the original the
shrunken down size of the phone is
mostly due to a smaller screen 5.2
inches in its size with full HD
resolution I actually quite liked the
blue color of this phone even if it is
really reflective and does get really
smudgy the size is really nice though
due to that screen as one-handed usage
has been really easy on this phone and
that also helps with the edge sense
which is of course the feature from the
U 11 that now makes it onto the U 11
life it is one of those flagship
features that still makes it on the
mid-range version and we do quite like
having it you can do a quick squeeze in
order to do one function and then
squeeze and hold in order to trigger yet
another function and even then HTC is
trying to further the functionality by
adding in a beta program in which you
can use the squeezes inside of
particular applications I've tried to
use it in a few different situations
with spotty results in most cases the
original global trigger is what goes off
instead of the in-app trigger but we
will continue testing this moving
forward especially since users can
actually program specific tabs in pretty
much any application for squeezing or
holding the rest of the bits and pieces
are all dialed back in the expected form
the Snapdragon 630 power of the device
and so far
has been able to keep up with my daily
usage and it's backed up by three
gigabytes of RAM and only 32 gigabytes
of on-board storage even though you do
have an SD card slot for expandable 'ti
i've already played quite a few games on
this phone like shadow 4 and i haven't
noticed the phone struggle to keep up at
all the performance is actually
noticeably smooth which is a feather in
the cap of the phone specifications and
optimization so far it doesn't really
feel like you're sacrificing too much by
picking the you 11 life and the same
goes for battery life with a 2600
milliamp hour battery that is found in
the u 11 life with my kind of usage that
includes a lot of media some gaming and
plenty of audio playing I was able to
get four hours of screen on time which I
thought was pretty impressive for a
battery size like this and also for the
kind of phone that I was using in fact
it's part of what made me want to
continue testing the phone to make sure
that this experience is definitely the
norm now audio has always been a focus
in one way or another for HTC and the
u11 life tries to soften the blow of
putting away the headphone jack by
including a pair of USB C earbuds these
u sonic compatible earbuds can be
powered by the phone for active
noise-cancelling and this is all found
inside of the settings and can be
triggered in the notification shade it
will try to cater the earbuds for a
better perl file for noise cancelling
and for the most part I've had a good
time with these earbuds music and
YouTube in particular have been a blast
to enjoy due to this sound experience
but there is something that we can't
really let slide and while it's nice
that these HTC earphones are included in
the box
there is no adapter in the box for using
your own headphones instead of putting
one in the Box users will have to buy an
adapter separately for an extra cost we
felt the need to really mention what
could be a contentious choice by HTC
now there's another place where HTC
wanted to continue the high-end
experience as much as possible and it
continues in the cameras HTC put 16
megapixel cameras on both sides of this
phone so that you would actually have
some pretty high-quality selfies and so
far that seems to be the case the rear
camera is different from the 12
megapixel shooter of the original u 11
and both of these 16 megapixel cameras
move up to an aperture of f28 for
personally I have not spent enough time
with the original HTC u 11 which is the
reason why I want to give the camera a
little bit more time in terms of testing
I'm going to be getting my hands on a u
11 so that I can see how the quality
changes from
the original flagship to this more
affordable life edition and finally
there is the software which in my case
involves HTC Sense now some people might
not like HTC's take on Android but it's
certainly less in-your-face than plenty
of other iterations and you'll get even
less of that with the Android 1 Edition
which uses a very stripped-down version
of Android that is made to make the
phone even more affordable HTC Sense
feed returns as well where social media
posts can be accumulated in a grid
format for easy viewing aside from that
a number of features that you may be
familiar with from other HTC devices
returns here and we'll get into those
more in our full review but the main
addition that I want to mention here is
HTC Alexa Amazon Alexa makes it onto the
U 11 life as well so that you have more
than one voice assistant available with
this phone as an avid Google assistant
user I'm still getting a further feel
for Alexa as a potential daily voice
assistant and it will be taken into
consideration for our full review I'll
try to use Alexa more than Google
assistant and see if it actually
provides a worthy replacement but
nonetheless it is good to have a choice
between two of the major assistance
available now so for all that HTC is
trying to do with this device the hope
is that the you 11 experience can be had
for less money and then of course is
going to hinge on the price and as we
mentioned before different versions of
the you 11 life will be available with
different types of software and in
almost all cases the phone will sell for
349 dollars which is a pretty aggressive
price for a phone that so far has been
succeeding in being a reliable version
of a flagship phone that doesn't
sacrifice too much in the few days that
I've used this phone as my daily driver
I've been a bit surprised at how easily
has handled my everyday tasks and usage
it would be easy to just dismiss a
lesser version of a flagship phone but
real world experience with the you 11
life has me thinking a little bit harder
stay tuned for my full review and let us
know what you think of the you 11 life
and indeed the other version of the you
11 that is not going to be making it to
more markets but is still a new version
of the you 11 flagship we'll see you all
in the comments down below and don't
forget to give us some likes on these
videos because we'd love to see those
thumbs up and then subscribe to the
