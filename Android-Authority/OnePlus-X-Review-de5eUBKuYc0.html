hopes to marry the features of the most
recent flagship with the value of their
first offering and with the design
overhaul it seems they may have been
able to do it but is this the phone for
you it's time to find out because it's
Josh of agar from Android thority what's
going on everybody and this is the
oneplus X design is the most striking
change seen in the oneplus X off the bat
gone is the larger body and the subtle
curves and now we have a black slate
device utilizing dual glass panels and a
metal frame now there is a ceramic
version of this phone that is available
that uses a special fire baked ceramic
for the backing that also makes the
phone a little bit heavier but that is
more of a special edition device so what
we have here is the Onyx Edition that
utilizes glass primarily starting with
the metal frame there are a number of
micro cuts in it that help a lot with
the handling they don't necessarily
scrape the skin by any means but they
are very easily felt when gripping the
phone all the buttons are on the writes
with the power button below the dual SIM
and now micro SD capable tray and the
volume rockers and opposite all of that
is a returning feature from the oneplus
2 the alert slider on the bottom oneplus
does return to the micro USB charging
port and there are two grills here but
only one of them houses a speaker and if
you look really hard you can see the
markings of capacitive keys underneath
the 5-inch screen which are really close
to the bottom and take a little getting
used to in terms of actually reaching
them the screen is just the right size
for handling and above it the proximity
sensor helps in triggering the ambient
display then finally around the back you
have the oneplus logo front and center
and the camera optics nestled in the
corner now we haven't really had any
shortage of smaller devices this year
but the oneplus X takes a pretty sleek
design to keep this form-factor feeling
pretty fresh one-handed usage is the
highlight here with the flat sides and
those micro cuts helping it sit very
snug in the hand while reaching from
side to side and with the dual glass
design this is still a very fingerprint
prone device and even in filming this
review we had to wipe down the phone
after every single shot so yes there are
some sources of inspiration that the
oneplus X might seem to derive from but
we think that oneplus has done a good
job of keeping it from being way too
obvious and ultimately what you get is a
premium looking and feeling device that
somewhat surprises when you realize how
much you'll be paying for
but before we talk about that let's go
to the display this is an AMOLED Full HD
resolution display that brings the
standard form of quality with some
punched up colors due to the black
levels that this kind of display
provides text is sharp enough for a
5-inch display when reading and media
still looks good and brightness is also
pretty high and when you crank this
thing up the white areas of the
interface and any applications might
kind of blind a little bit even in
normal lighting situations however the
choice of AMOLED is taken advantage of
here by the oneplus software the ambient
display is triggered by waving one's
hand over the proximity sensor up top
and it shows the minimal version of the
lock screen to view notifications and
then deeper in oxygen OS is now in dark
mode by default which is a really nice
touch and by keeping the AMOLED from
showing too many brighter colors and
spots it also would mean that battery
life can get a bit of a boost
underneath that screen we have what's
pretty much a shrunken down version of
the oneplus one what you actually think
is a pretty great thing the Snapdragon
801 returns with three gigabytes of RAM
showing that last year's phones are
still pretty viable enough in today's
space and for the most part it succeeds
in daily tasks while writing emails
listening to music watching the
occasional video and all the general
reading the phone really doesn't skip
much of a beat and if you were to fire
up a more recent high graphics video
game though the speed might come down a
bit but it's kind of negligible it's in
actual comparisons to the current
flagship smartphones that the 801 does
really show its age while some of the
blame might be put on a little bit of
the Polish that oxygen OS still needs
those instances were still fairly common
there might have been little stutters
when YouTube started playing a video or
small but noticeable instances when
flexi would fumble with a letter and it
became clear to us that while the
Snapdragon 801 is still a very viable
processing package it is still over a
year old
so hardware might be a bigger focus as
oneplus has replaced a couple of
features from the oneplus 2 and put in a
couple of new ones
the main omission here is the lack of a
fingerprint reader and also NFC is still
missing the alert slider is back and
proves itself as an easy way of mostly
silencing the phone and though there are
two grilles on the bottom as I mentioned
earlier only one of them is a speaker
which provides audio skew to the higher
ends which is kind of unpleasant despite
the audio being pretty loud speaking of
headphone audio using a good pair does
make for
experience but your wires can serve an
extra purpose the oneplus X actually
comes with a radio tuner that works well
enough if you really do want to listen
to some local stations another feature
that returns is the dual SIM tray but it
also houses one of the most significant
additions a micro SD card capability one
of the trays can now house a micro SD
card for expandable storage which really
helps because the 16 gigabytes of
on-board storage runs out pretty quickly
though it doesn't have fast or wireless
charging we found our time with the X to
be pretty long getting three hours of
screen on time might seem standard but
then when you factor in the price of
this phone it actually is pretty nice
and a little bit above average though it
is important to mention that we got that
screen on time when using the phone on a
more moderate scale standby time is
actually pretty good on the phone as
well but we give a lot of credit to the
ambient display and the dark mode
leveraging the AMOLED display very well
now this one part I didn't want to leave
until the end there is a problem when it
comes to the mobile data bands on the
oneplus X it will mostly affect people
in the US who are on 18 T or t-mobile in
the case of AT&amp;amp;T this phone does not
have a band that will allow it to stay
on LTE connections all very consistently
and for t-mobile which is looking to go
to band 12 all over the place when it
does make that change this phone doesn't
support that band so you're going to
lose LTE connectivity on that network as
well the issue with that is that this
phone then becomes not future-proof
quite literally in the u.s. if you do
require LTE the fastest of speeds for
your networks on those two carriers then
this phone unfortunately will have an
expiration date now that doesn't
necessarily mean that this phone is not
viable in the US you can still use it
here and you'll still get good
connections but eventually that LTE
connection will probably go by the
wayside for everyone else around the
world however you probably will still
have a great time with this phone given
that it still supports a lot of the
Bands outside of the US the camera of
the oneplus X is a 13 megapixel shooter
that uses phase detection autofocus and
leverages HDR the front-facing shooter
on the other hand is of 8 megapixels so
you can get some pretty big selfies now
we'll start off with the app which is
the same as the app from the oneplus 2
and you use swipes on the viewfinder in
order to change the modes and then after
that you don't get a whole lot of
control over your shots a few other
modes are available though including
slow motion video time-lapse
and panorama even if you are going to
have to use the portrait orientation on
panorama which we thought was just a
little bit annoying the app is fast
enough getting shots done in a pretty
decent amount of time so that moving to
the next one isn't too far off but even
in medium light situations the camera
ops for slower shutter speeds in order
to compensate for exposure so for
pictures slower shutter speeds aren't
necessarily a bad thing but it does make
low-light situations like concerts a bit
harder to achieve good results from but
this actually permeates into the video
capture mode in which video is tend to
get a little bit choppier when the lower
shutter speeds have to be used and this
is one of the main flaws that we
observed in the camera experience darker
areas and photos are still quite fuzzy
which is kind of expected and they
aren't often that disgusting to look at
and colors are not particularly dulled
but they can use a bit more of a punch
unfortunately when using HDR you're just
going to get a brighter photo overall
and the colors for the most part remain
the same so for a daily shooter the
oneplus X requires a little bit more
diligence than usual to get good shots
but for the price we don't really fault
the camera too greatly for that unless
your focus is for filming video and
finally in software we have the return
of the oneplus built oxygen OS which
brings a mostly stock looking Android
addition to the X much of it is really
familiar as this is a lollipop build and
you get the paginated app drawer and all
the quick settings and everything pretty
much looks familiar you do get the shelf
where frequent apps and contacts are put
along with user-defined widgets it is
actually off by default and we do think
that it is a decent place to put widgets
on so you don't have to have extra home
screens so we turned it on and more
input options are available including
using soft keys instead of the
capacitive keys and then gestures like
double tapping the screen to wake the
phone we already talked about the dark
mode but we do have to mention that
there's a bit of customization here as
you can change the accent color so you
can give the interface a bit of a
different look what oxygen is able to
boast when it was first released was its
own version of app permissions which
give a nice insight into the kinds of
things that apps are trying to access on
your phone that's kind of the whole
story with oxygen OS but we will say
that by highlighting the dark mode
oxygen has taken that little step
forward to make its version of Android
be that little bit different from stock
editions we do think that oneplus a
company that
prides itself in being different should
continue to add even more to oxygen OS
in the future to further set it apart
and finally the moment of truth a
premium body and pretty good internals
make this phone seem like quite a steal
as the price of the oneplus X is 250
dollars with an invite yes invites are
still required but open sales windows
will start small and gradually become
full-blown
and it's with that low low price that we
have what might be one pluses most
compelling offering yet which is
interesting because this is only their
third smartphone this is not supposed to
be a flagship device and it doesn't
succeed in really meeting that standard
at least this year
what oneplus has basically told us here
is that it knows the oneplus one was a
great phone so here it is again in a
different looking package we think that
this is an actually pretty great phone
but that sentence has almost always
ended with the phrase for that price and
that's not really a bad thing when you
get a phone that just about anyone can
get and get some good usage from no it
isn't future proof by any means and for
users who need LTE it might expire
sooner rather than later but for now
this is one of the best bang for buck
phones we've had all year
so as always thank you guys very much
for watching and hope you enjoyed this
review of the oneplus X it is out right
now in the States and is available for
purchase using an invite so you can head
on over there and get a phone that is
incredibly accessible easy to use and
just might be one of the best entry
points for Android today there are some
flaws with it but you kind of expect
that because this phone is not supposed
to be a flagship killer per se but it's
supposed to be the best bang for a buck
and that's what we think it is keep it
