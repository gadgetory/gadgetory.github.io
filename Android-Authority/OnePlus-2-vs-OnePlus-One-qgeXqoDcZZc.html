momentum of the first but does it offer
that much more than the original
considering the 1+1 is still available
for a very good price point now that's
what we're about to find out because it
is Josh of agar from Android Authority
what's going on everybody and this is
the oneplus 2 versus the oneplus one
with the same size in the screen the
oneplus 2 s handling is very similar to
its original counterpart though the
overall footprint is just that little
bit smaller and also that little bit
more accessible but what is so
noticeable right off the bat is the
substantial feel that is a metal frame
in the oneplus 2 now which not only adds
to the heft but feels really nice even
compared to the lighter but plastic clad
oneplus one that isn't to say that the
oneplus 2 feels heavy or the oneplus one
feels cheap but you can really sense the
upgraded materials now the elements
around the device and the oneplus to
show what new features the company is
bringing to the table capacitive keys
still line the front but now the home
button is a carved out area this is to
house the fingerprint reader which is
flanked by simple lines for back and
recent apps keys which can be switched
around the button layout has been
brought all to the right side with the
power button below the volume rocker
opposite of these buttons is the new
three-stage slider the action slider
which will toggle among the different
notification modes found in lollipop and
of course there is the new USB type-c
connector port at the bottom which we
will get to a little more later what I
can tell you now is that having a
reversible plug is already proving to be
a small but noticeable positive now the
back materials for both of these phones
come in the original sandstone black
variety but customizations will be
possible right off the bat for the
oneplus 2 with various covers that
include Kevlar and wood what is
important to note here over is how the
backs are implemented if you can see
here you can see that instead of a full
shell replacement that was in the
oneplus one the back cover of the two is
simply a slab of very thin textured
plastic which easily pops on and off
this also means that the new material
will only change the very backing and
really not much else when you compare
the oneplus 2 to the 1 plus 1 in these
replacements the metal frame is of
course a very welcome change but it does
hinder the customization of the 2 just
that little bit really both of these
devices look and feel pretty similar but
we give the oneplus 2 more points
because actually feels a little bit more
premium going from one to two actually
does feel like the upgrade that it needs
to be between these two devices we moved
to the display for the so-called
flagship killers and find that the
experience actually largely remains the
same from one to two 1080p resolution is
the name of the game for both of these
phones which might come as a bit of a
bummer to those who wanted a quad HD
screen in the oneplus 2 but given the
price it isn't that much of a surprise
and a higher resolution could have
easily been the trump card for the new
phone but that simply won't be the case
that said 1080p is still the complete
standard in all media thankfully the
fidelity of the display has been
upgraded in the oneplus 2 viewing angles
are pretty great viewing in daylight is
pretty easy and text remains exactly as
sharp as it did in last year's edition
so though there may not be much to talk
about in ways of enhancements between
these two displays we can definitely say
that what was once a good 1080p
experience in the oneplus one becomes a
pretty great 1080p experience in the
oneplus 2 but it is definitely in
performance where we feel the update as
the snapdragon 801 is bumped up to the
810 oneplus really goes for the gold
with one of the most powerful processors
in existence right now the oneplus 2
thus is simply a beast in the
performance Department and I have yet to
experience any slowdowns or crashes as a
result going from place to place and the
oxygen OS is as smooth as ever only made
even more fluid with oxygens own
transitions and running applications is
a breeze when the bugs of this operating
system are kept at a minimum and gaming
is as good as ever
with 3d games like UFC and sprite based
games like Angry Birds to proving nice
and enjoyable for long periods of time
now for those worried about the heat of
the processing package under load I can
say that after long periods of gaming
the phone did get warm but it never got
uncomfortable now this is not to say
that the oneplus one is far behind in
performance on the contrary it is still
one of the most reliable devices
available today and when considering the
current great price point having the
tried-and-true Snapdragon 801 can be
considered a steal in today's general
market you might not really notice the
difference in speed opening applications
as you can kind of see here and that is
also true in actual daily usage the
typical user will really have a good
time no matter which of these two they
pick now keep in mind that the oneplus
one is a unit that has been used for
over a year already so you can see that
it actually hasn't really lost its step
so if not the screen or the overall
design
language it feels that hardware is where
oneplus hopes to differentiate itself in
the - and we already covered performance
but in hardware the simplest of these
additions is the action slider which
changes the notification mode in
lollipop the slides feel really solid
and the textured button makes it easy to
find when the phone is in the pocket
need to quickly silence the phone no
problem even then it's time that we saw
some new inputs and Android and we do
credit oneplus for that move forward
speaking of input the new fingerprint
reader on the oneplus 2 is working quite
well thus far even when the phone screen
is off just resting the registered
finger on the area wakes and unlocks the
phone in short order and all the
connections remain largely the same but
there is actually a difference here on
the oneplus 2 as it supports dual SIM
out of the box which can be a big deal
for those in the West who have never
experienced it but that's not to say
that will be completely useful for
everyone in the States unless the user
travels a lot but in those cases it can
actually be quite handy and of course
there is the glaring omission of NFC in
the oneplus 2 which is a big deal not
only because the oneplus 2 will then not
be able to take advantage of all the
different pay services that the phones
are supposed to be doing soon but also
for anyone that uses audio peripherals
like I do with Sony headphones or any
other audio devices that take advantage
of NFC capabilities just simply not
going to be the case while the oneplus
one never really made us worry about
shutdowns far before bedtime and the
same case is true for the two we can't
actually feel a bit more life in the new
iteration both phones will definitely
get through the day's worth of moderate
to heavy usage but the oneplus 2 will
likely have a little bit more in the
tank before it takes its night recharge
now we're taking a general look at the
oneplus 2 camera mostly because we have
been told that updates will be coming
very soon and we want to make sure we
have those for our full review
nonetheless 13 megapixels remain the
size for both of these cameras with F
2.0 aperture which should prove pretty
decent in low-light situations but what
the oneplus 2 brings to the table is
optical image stabilization with laser
autofocus both of which should help in
plenty of key situations but that said
the app has been given a bit of a
facelift if you are used to the oneplus
one in CyanogenMod camera app oxygen OS
actually strips the camera app down to
its main essentials at least for now
including HDR clear image panorama
and even a time-lapse mode with not many
options found deeper within it's still a
pretty responsive experience but it's
certainly not the fastest out there but
again OTA should be able to improve this
what really is a pet peeve of mine
however is spot metering which is what
it uses in order to get the exposure as
was the case with the oneplus one it is
kind of easy to get brighter elements
blown out in the - but this has been
toned down to some degree in the update
but what hinders the oneplus 2 despite
it so is is what held the one back with
AF 2.0 aperture low-light shots require
a balance of high ISO and slower shutter
speed but in the oneplus 2 it seems
slower shutter speed is prioritized
making OSS job that much tougher
unfortunately that means that both
phones require really steady hands for
low-light shots despite both basically
performing really well in bright
situations so both cameras manage to be
good companions on the daily though
oxygen OS does stifle them to a fair
degree at least for now but as flagship
killers there's still quite a bit of
ground for oneplus to cover and that
goes true for this year as it did with
last year's offering now software for
oneplus has been a pretty eventful
affair with the one originally coming
with cyanogen but when that relationship
went south oneplus had to make it
themselves and now it is called oxygen
OS now for anyone with a oneplus one
updates to the included original signage
and software can be updated to 12s now
that's the version that I do have on my
unit but installing oxygen OS does
require some work on the recovery and if
you wanted to change we will talk about
Sandwich in for a little bit image and
how much it did bring to the table aside
from the usual gestures somewhat
different take on the core elements of
material design and some security
features CyanogenMod did allow for a lot
of customization in the Android build of
the oneplus one all of that has been
basically stripped in oxygen so there
are some places where customization can
be had like in the notification
drop-down other features like the screen
op gestures and one addition of the dark
mode don't do too much to make this feel
any different from let's say a nexus of
course you can factor in the Shelf which
is a place that has two widgets for your
frequent apps and frequent contacts and
it is basically a replacement for Google
now but even Google now is still
accessible by holding down the home but
though it is still easy to root and rum
the 1+1 and I imagine the same will go
for the to the built-in oxygen OS
manages to be functional and simple
which we always like but if oneplus is
looking to really differentiate itself
it has to do more in its operating
system insight as it has been doing on
their outside and so there you have it
for this look at the oneplus 2 and the
oneplus one the full review is gradually
on its way but it felt right to see
where the updates and the upgrades were
made from 1 to 2 in some places more
than others
there is real progress that really makes
the follow-up to the oneplus one a
worthy contender while we will further
see if the oneplus 2 actually kills
current flagships we will make the case
that the oneplus one is still a very
viable offering especially with its
lower price point that said the oneplus
2 still comes in at a pretty good price
on its own so it really only matters if
you want to spend the extra money for
extra features like the fingerprint
sensor the alert slider a new USB
standard and of course the very powerful
processor underneath that being said
however keep it tuned to Android
Authority for all of the best coverage
of the oneplus 2 and don't forget to
