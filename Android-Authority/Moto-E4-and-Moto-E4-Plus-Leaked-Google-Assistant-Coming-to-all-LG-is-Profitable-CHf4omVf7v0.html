there because we think that two Motorola
devices just leaked we also got news
about the Google assistant in Google a
low and if you're like me who really
wants to see LG succeed we have good
news for you
a pair of Motorola devices has passed
through the Federal Communications
Commission believed to represent the
Moto e for and the Moto e for plus the
listings are for devices with model
numbers XP one seven six two four the 4
and the XP one seven seven three four
the four plus with the latter believed
to house a five thousand milliamp hour
battery what would be the largest
battery in any Motorola smartphone
tipster rollin quant also indicates that
the e4 plus will feature a media tech
system-on-a-chip the suspected efore
listing meanwhile appeared earlier this
week suggesting that it will contain a
twenty eight hundred million power
battery and run Android at seven o new
get rid of the box according to phone
arena the e4 will also include sixteen
gigabytes of internal storage 4G LTE
Bluetooth 4.2 and dual-sim capabilities
we don't have any other details to go on
thus far but it is possible that the
devices will have a similar ethos to the
Moto e 3 and the e3 power released last
year those phones housed identical specs
save for the internal storage RAM and
battery which were all greater in the
power model so when will these puppies
be released
well last year's models were released in
September so that's a pretty educated
guess so you one of those people who
want the new Google Assistant button on
your device good news if you've been
waiting for the new assistant button to
make its way to your device your wait is
almost up according to a response to a
user on Twitter Google's head of product
a meat fillet confirmed that the
assistant button in a low is now rolling
out to all users starting with Google
assistant this is the service which can
be called upon from within a low
conversations to answer questions to
make it more prominent Google is putting
the assistant icon right inside the
compose box tap it once to launch it and
start asking for those movies show times
or whatever you want next Google is
simplifying the gist finding process in
one of aloes most recent updates Google
added the lucky gist feature which
provided a way to share random gifs with
friends if you prefer something more
specific the new version of allo will
help you quickly navigate to the jiff
search menu just by tapping on the
smiling icon in your chat bar and
swiping left good news for LG because
they are now making a profit but it may
not be for the reasons you think it
looks like business has been good for LG
in the first quarter of this year the
company has said that the operating
profit is estimated at 922 billion won
which is around eight hundred and twelve
million dollars u.s. this is well above
market expectations and represents an 82
percent increase when compared to the
same period last year the company's
revenue is also increased LG generated
fourteen point six trillion won about
twelve point eight billion during the
first three months of the year up by
nine point seven percent when compared
with the previous year this is the
second best quarter and LG for its
history in terms of both operating
profit and revenue the finalized
earnings report will be released later
this month but it's not because of the
LG G six industry watchers believe that
the improved profitability of the
company's TV and home appliance
businesses is one of the major reasons
for the great financial results LG has
been focused on selling a lot of premium
products in the recent past including
high-end home electronics onto the LG
signature brand I honestly got to tell
