authority and LG's new V series is LG's
attempt to set foot into a new premium
smartphone market but is a unique form
factor new multimedia capabilities and
enhanced durability enough to make this
your next smartphone let's find out with
the LG v10 LG has never really been
known to make the most premium of
smartphones but at least they were
always functional with the v10 you're
getting the best of both worlds the
sides are made of 316l stainless steel
and the rest of the body is wrapped in a
dura skin that feels very soft to the
touch and gives the phone a lot of grip
these new material choices gives the v10
a very solid and sturdy feel in the hand
but it also makes it extremely durable
against drops the v10 is an
indestructible or shatterproof but it is
military 810g certified against drops
which means that go and stand the
average drop a lot better than your
normal everyday smartphone and if you
want to see exactly how durable the v10
is make sure to check out our durability
test after the reviews done even with
these new material choices the v10 is
still very much an LG device through and
through the sharp corners and slightly
rounded top and bottom is very
reminiscent of the g4s design with the
only exception being the v10 is a
completely flat phone and doesn't have
that signature curve to the body that LG
put on pretty much every smartphone they
released this year in typical LG fashion
the back is removable giving you access
to the battery and a micro SD card slot
and the power and volume buttons are
still on the back which helps keep the
sides of the phone completely clean
along the top is a microphone and an IR
blaster for controlling your peripherals
and on the bottom is a standard 3.5
millimeter headphone jack micro USB port
speaker and a second microphone the v10
is a large phone there's definitely no
getting around that and even though the
Duras skin material keeps the phone from
falling out of my hands it's still not
the easiest phone to use in one hand the
main reason for that has to do with the
display where I guess displays would be
more technically correct because the v10
actually has two screens the main
display is a 5.7 inch IPS LCD with 2560
by 1440 resolution and there's really
nothing bad you can say about it it's
bright beautiful char
ez2c outdoors and the large size makes
it a lot of fun for videos and games
overall it's nothing short of what you
would expect from LG the real kicker
here is the secondary screen at the top
and if you add this in this actually
makes the screen close to six inches in
size the secondary screen works as a hub
for notifications app shortcuts recently
opened applications media controls quick
contacts upcoming events in your
calendar and will show you basic
information like time and date when the
main display is turned off in a lot of
ways it's quite similar to what Samsung
has done with their edge display all of
these various components can be adjusted
and modified in the settings and for
some personalization you can have your
name or a short message to be displayed
when the main display is on or off to be
honest I was a little bit skeptical of
this secondary display and after using
it for a while I'm still not entirely
sold on it but there are a couple of
things I do like about it I like that I
can see what notifications I have like
missed phone calls or text messages
without having to wake up the entire
display and I like that the banner
notifications pop up in the secondary
display which keeps the main display
uninterrupted from notifications the
biggest problem with this secondary
screen is the location being at the top
makes it very hard to reach at least
with one hand and if you're trying to
use it as a multitasker of sorts to
quickly jump between apps it just
doesn't feel as quick as doing it the
traditional way because the screen is so
in conveniently placed the execution
isn't perfect and I like it a lot more
than I thought I would but if you don't
like it at all it can be turned off in
the settings just like the g4 the v10 is
running on the Snapdragon 808 where
you're getting four gigs of RAM instead
of three performance is about what you'd
expect from a high-end smartphone and
the v10 definitely lives up to its name
it's fast smooth and responsive in
day-to-day use with very smooth
scrolling and animations it does
everything from as simple as opening up
applications and web browsing to more
intense tasks like gaming without much
of a hiccup and with four gigs of RAM
the v10 has no problems jumping back and
forth between multiple applications even
with LG's heavy skin the processor and
RAM keeps the phone trekking along just
fine and never in any instance did I
ever feel like the phone had to catch up
to me the v10 is available in only one
storage configuration at 64 gigabytes so
no more and no less
but 64 gigs should be more than ample
space for most people but if it is not
you do have the option to
expand upon that with the built-in micro
SD card slot for up to two terabytes
the most notable piece of hardware
however is the addition of a fingerprint
scanner and with so many manufacturers
adding fingerprint scanners to their
flagship smartphones it was only a
matter of time before LG did to the
fingerprint scanner is embedded in the
power button on the back and not
counting the Nexus 5x it's a solid first
attempt by LG it unlocks very quickly
and is pretty reliable but it's not the
most accurate fingerprint scanner that
I've ever used I would say that eight
out of ten times and the locks on the
first try and the other two times it's
usually telling me to try again that's
obviously not the biggest failure rate
but it is something you'll notice the
more you use it the external speaker
isn't in the most optimal position being
mounted on the bottom and can be pretty
easily muffled with your hand in
landscape but for what it is it sounds
fine the real audio experience on the
v10 comes internally there's a 32-bit
high v digital to analog converter built
in and this is a huge deal for anyone
who use their smartphone as their
primary music player it's not a gimmick
at all and is 100 cent the real deal it
works with mp3 audio files and streaming
audio so you're not going to be left out
if you're using apps like Spotify or
google play music and as long as you
have a decent pair of headphones you'll
definitely notice the difference the
upsampling makes in terms of a crisper
and clearer sound the 3000 milliamp hour
battery inside is good enough for a full
day with average use but it typically
never lasted me much more than that and
if I was using the camera heavily or
playing a lot of games recharging the
phone midway through the day was pretty
much expected on the bright side it
doesn't take very long to charge up or
top off thanks to the fast and LG is
still one of the few major smartphone
manufacturers left that offer a
removable battery so you can easily swap
it out for a fresh one if you want the
cameras on the v10 is quite the
interesting story and there's a lot
going on here the main camera is a 16
megapixel F 1.8 aperture lens with
optical image stabilization and if that
sounds familiar it's because it's the
same exact sensor from the g4 so wasn't
all that surprising to see excellent
looking photos come out of the v10 the
images are sharp and well detailed color
reproduction and dynamic range is
fantastic and it's just an overall very
enjoyable camera to take pictures with
there's a hint of over sharpening in the
images but it's nothing too
plastic and I feel like in most
situations that actually helps more than
it hinders and low light the camera does
tend to overexpose especially in the
highlights which are typically blown out
and sometimes it doesn't get the white
balance quite right but aside from that
the images still retain a fair amount of
detail and generally look pretty good on
the front of the phone there are not one
but two front facing five megapixel
cameras we've seen dual camera setups
before on other smartphones but this is
the first time it's been done on the
front instead of the rear
unlike other smartphones that have used
dual camera setup for depth information
or 3d images the two five megapixel
sensors on the b10 are just used as to
individual front-facing shooters one is
an 80-degree lens for a more standard
field of view and the other is a hundred
twenty degree wide angle lens and you
can toggle back and forth between the
two within the software the quality of
the front-facing cameras are actually
quite good and the 120 degree wide angle
lens is a lot of fun to use and really
comes in handy when you're trying to
take group shots when LG released the g4
earlier this year there was a lot of
hype about the ability to shoot in raw
and DSLR like manual controls for photos
and those same controls are available on
the v10 but with the v10 LG has brought
those mannequin trolls over to video
which is a pretty big deal for a
smartphone camera so now you can do many
of the things that you would normally do
on a DSLR like adjust the white balance
ISO shutter speed and manually control
the focus videos can be recorded in 4k
1080p slow-motion and you can even
record in a cinematic mode and bump the
frame rate down to 24 frames for like
truly cinematic look when recording
videos having good audio to accompany is
pretty important so the v10 allows you
to easily monitor the audio in real time
adjust the audio levels change the
direction of the audio recording and
even eliminate interference with the
wind noise filter
there's a new study mode built-in that's
designed to remove motion blur even more
so than what OS is capable of it only
works when recording in 1080p or below
but the footage is very smooth very
stable and almost looks like something
you would get out of using a gimbal or
some sort of handheld rig all these main
controls are great and if you're
seriously the smartphone videography
you're going to be able to some really
excellent looking footage with this
camera but if you rather just have some
fun with your camera there's a new
feature called multi be recording that
lets you use up to all three cameras at
once to really offer some perspective
and in the right scenarios it can be a
lot of fun to use now the biggest
problem with video is that they're not
easily shareable social media due to
large file sizes but LG's video editing
software lets you quickly edit the video
into a 15-second highlight reel at the
touch of a button which makes it a lot
easier to share and coincidentally is
the same length as an Instagram video
imagine that the software experience
will be pretty familiar to anyone who's
used an LG device within the last couple
of years and with the exception of the
software features for the secondary
display it's the same experience that we
saw on the g4 LG skin still isn't the
most attractive thing in the world and
the settings menu still feels just as
cluttered and convoluted as before but
it does bring a bevy of features that
fans of LG may have become accustomed to
over the years you can still double tap
to wake or sleep the phone or set a
pattern of taps or as LG calls them
knocks for additional lockscreen
security resize the keyboard for easier
typing and multitask simultaneously
between two apps with LG's dual window
feature because the v10 is quite the
stretch to use in one hand
LG's added in a feature that lets you
shrink the screen and resize it by
swiping across the Android soft keys all
of this is running on android 5.1.1
lollipop currently but LG has stated
that an update to marshmallow will be
coming either before the end of this
year or early next year that's still a
pretty big window of time but let's hope
that it happens sooner than later the
v10 is available now on Verizon t-mobile
and
and is reigning between 600 to 700
dollars off contract but you do have the
option to finance the cost through each
respective carrier in a nutshell the v10
can be looked at as a much more powerful
version of the g4 but that was LG's
intention it's got a larger screen a
better building design a fingerprint
scanner and a camera that is both
excellent for photos and video if the g4
fell short of your expectations that you
wanted more well more is what you're
getting with the v10 as always thank you
