android authority and the LG g2 from
last year was one of the biggest hits of
2013 and LG is looking to capitalize on
that this year with its successor and
this phone has been leaking like crazy
there's been a ton of rumors so today
we're going to be rounding up all of
those rumors and let you guys know what
you can expect from the LG g3 alright so
before I get started the LG g3 is only a
couple of days away from being announced
and our very own Josh magar will be
there covering and doing a hands-on
video and a ton of other coverage as
well on top of the review itself so if
you don't want to miss out on those
videos make sure to subscribe to the
channel down below if you haven't
already and also if there's anything in
particular that you guys want to see
about the LG g3 if you want to know
about the camera or anything else to
display how big phone is leave a comment
down below letting us know what you guys
want to see and we will definitely do
the best we can as far as covering all
of that content but let's go ahead and
get the specs of the g3 out of the way
as this is probably the most confirmed
part about this phone which we most
recently saw in a slide briefing which
lists a Snapdragon 801 processor with
three gigs of ram 32 gigs of on-board
storage and a 3,000 milliamp hour
battery so this phone sounds like it's
going to be an absolute beast at least
on paper and we haven't seen that many
phones so far with three gigs of ram so
it's going to be nice to see another
flagship phone with three gigs of ram
and that 3,000 milliamp hour battery
sounds like it's going to last all day
so the specs on this guy sound really
awesome supposedly it's going to be a
5.5 inch display with a resolution of
2560 x 1440 so this will be the first
flagship smartphone in the united states
with a 2k display which we didn't get on
the galaxy s5 or the HTC One m8 so I'm
really excited for this display LG's
always made really nice looking panels
so I'm super excited to see how how
and sharp that it looks and the ppi this
thing is going to be through the roof
we're looking at about 538 ppi so it's
going to be ridiculous I'm really
looking forward to it probably going to
be one of the most enjoyable displays
that we've ever seen on a smartphone but
around back we're looking at a 13
megapixel camera and we don't really
know a whole lot about the camera
outside of its mega pixel count so it's
not going to be 16 or 20 like the galaxy
s5 or the Xperia z2 but we're expecting
maybe OS Plus technology which we first
saw in the g pro 2 so I don't see any
reason for LG not to implement that into
the g3 and os + basically combines
Hardware stabilization with software
stabilization and LG has been really
good with their cameras lately
especially since the g2 and also the g
pro 2 so the camera is also another
aspect that I'm really looking forward
to I'm really want to see how well this
camera performs out how good the quality
of the photos are so I'll definitely
looking forward to that one of the most
interesting parts about the back of this
phone though is that extra sensor right
next to the camera which is something a
lot of people have been wondering about
is it a fingerprint sensor is it a heart
rate monitor is it a extra camera sensor
for capturing depth information what is
it turns out according to some of the
leaks and rumors that we've heard its
supposedly a sensor for assisting with
auto focusing and allowing better
performance and low light now let's talk
about the design of the g3 and according
to some leaked photos it looks like it's
still made of plastic so that hasn't
changed but when the g2 came out last
year it featured some very interesting
design cues one being the super thin
bezels on the sides and to being the
back facing buttons which LG has sort of
turned into their own trademark and both
of those seem to be making a return on
the g3 and the back facing buttons they
look like they're a lot more flush to
the phone now they're not protruding so
it looks like you're actually be able to
lay this phone down flat and
have the problem of accidentally
pressing the buttons when you lay the
phone down so it looks like LG has
figured that out which which is the plus
in my book as far as the colors are
concerned we're obviously getting a
black and white model which we've seen
renders up and it looks like LG is going
to be jumping on the gold bandwagon with
a gold LG g3 and we've seen gold on the
iphone 5s gold on the galaxy s5 and gold
on the HTC One m8 so it looks like LG is
joining in on the party with the gold
option is well I'm probably going to be
picking up a black model but it's always
really nice to have options so i'm not
really complaining on the software side
of things we're expecting the g3 to ship
with 4.4 point2 KitKat with LG's custom
interface on top and from the link
screenshots that we've seen it looks
like they've scaled things back quite a
bit the UI looks a lot flatter more
minimalistic and just a lot cleaner over
all the colors don't look quite as
punching in your face which to me is a
good thing so I I'm liking the new look
and it doesn't look quite as cluttered
either you can see a comparison of the
notification shade looks a little bit
cleaner not a not quite as much stuff
going on which is good we're probably
expecting some of the same staple
features we've seen before in previous
LG devices like the qslide apps which
lets you multitask and the NOC code as
well which we saw in the g pro 2 so
those are probably going to be there but
one of the most interesting features
that we've heard about that we've seen
leaked so far is LG's concierge service
which supposedly is going to be like
Google now where it gives you
information based on your usage and your
habits it's going to be interesting to
see how well this particular feature
actually works if it works just as well
as Google now and what it can actually
do beyond Google now they don't actually
make you want to use it or if it's just
going to wind up being like s voice a
service that nobody ever really uses but
I guess we really don't have that long
of a wait to find out but that's going
to do it for this video guys the LG g3
is only a couple of days away and like I
mentioned earlier our very own Josh
magar will be there covering the event
