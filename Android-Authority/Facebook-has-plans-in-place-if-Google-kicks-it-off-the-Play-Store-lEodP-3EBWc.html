a contingency plan if Google comes
callin asking Facebook to pay its server
bill now this is all a follow up to a
show I did two weeks ago where we talked
about all the excessive API calls from
Facebook to Google that cost Google a
lot of cheddar now if that was all
completely Greek to you allow me to
explain it briefly like this you see you
know when you get a facebook
notification on your Android phone your
mom liked your dog pic or something well
that information had to go from Facebook
through to Google servers
that's called an API call now if you're
a small app developer with only a few
million users the cost that Google has
to bear is too small to measure but if
you're as big as Facebook the cost that
Google has to bear is massive for those
API calls and if mother Google demands
from Facebook that they help pay those
server costs the bill would be
gargantuan the information Zamir efrati
reports that Facebook has been weighing
its options in case a conflict with
Google results in the removal of
Facebook apps from the Play Store one
measure that Facebook is considering is
the creation of alternatives to Google's
cloud services targeting devices that
are sold without Google stamp of
approval in China and other countries
this includes the infrastructure for
delivering notifications making payments
and downloading installing apps and
updates Facebook could even host its own
App Store for other developers though
according to the information the social
company isn't really interested in doing
that
Facebook has also struck deals with many
carriers and manufacturers to have its
apps preloaded in new devices and has
even run wargames to simulate what would
happen if users could no longer download
Facebook from the Google Play Store
Facebook even went so far as to remove
the main app from the Google Play Store
for an entire country for a week to
gauge the reaction of its user base and
in a slightly unnerving move the company
intentionally induced errors that would
make its app unusable for some users
just to see how far I could push users
before they give up on using the app
even with all that abuse users kept
finding ways to use Facebook this could
be interesting to see how it all plays
out what are you
think it's gonna happen let me know in
the comments below thanks for watching
android army
