what's going on everybody can you guess
what I'm about to do Google made a lot
of people happy with an update to the
Nexus 7 last year we took the original
Nexus 7 and we put it to the test by
dropping it compared to the iPad Mini
and unfortunately it really didn't stack
up the original one was a little bit
thicker it did feel a little bit more
Hollow but it definitely did have lesser
build quality this update to the Nexus 7
brings a much sturdier but thinner and
just overall better feel and we want to
see how it stacks up compared to the
original so what we're gonna do is drop
it for you today I hope you got some
pain killers because this is gonna hurt
the test will comprised of three
different drops we're basically actually
for let's say four we're gonna drop it
on its back right like this and then on
one of its sides and then on one of the
other sides this time in portrait mode
and then finally on its face and we're
gonna see just how far the Nexus 7 can
go without dying and we'll get started
with the test right now
it's drop test time Nexus 7 2013 edition
drop test onto its back here we go
cameras checking cameras checking
cameras and try my best with the grip
here let's see if I can get to land flat
on its back
sickening thud right onto its back
didn't even bounce nothing like that I
got a perfect drop right there so let's
see what happens all right well the good
news here is that the back definitely
held up pretty well there were no cracks
not really anything there just some
scratches over here but very few I'm
dropping this on a hard Kong on cement
over here so we are not really working
with jagged rocks like in my previous
drop test but that being said I got a
perfect drop right flat on its back not
really any scratches even just a couple
over here and yeah actually looks pretty
good it still retains that nice sleek
look
one turn-on
Wow okay so so I actually have some bad
news uh that one drop it seems dropping
right on its back might have dislodged
something on the inside I can't hear any
shakes or anything loose inside but I
just tried to turn it on right before
the second drop test and I I can't get
it to power on at all so but the show
must go on and we're gonna drop it to
see what other aesthetic damage might
come up if we drop it on its side on its
other side and finally on its face
alright so drop tests on the side Nexus
7 let's see alright again I'm trying to
get try my best with the grip here just
to make sure it lands on its side and
there you go and you see it there the
cracks right onto the bottom portion of
the screen right here you kind of
spiderwebbed right there
it's no use in me trying to turn it back
on again because it just won't but yeah
there you go you can see the scratches
right on the what looks like the bottom
portion of the bezel maybe the bottom
left portion and it's spider webs over
to the side actually now that I think
about it we should try to drop the
opposite the side that was cracked so
I'm gonna drop it from where the
headphone jack is which is at the top so
right here trying to drop it so it lands
right on its side right there okay here
we go
there you go that was a good hit the
actual cover that goes around the entire
back of the Nexus 7 has snapped out so
you can probably see right over here
right there see I can actually separate
I can actually separate the tablet a
little bit more and also a little piece
snapped tiny little piece of plastic
snapped from just right around there the
Nexus 7 is essentially in two pieces now
so if I really wanted to I could just
really pry this Nexus 7 tablet into to
complete pieces but we have one last
test we already cracked the screen but
we have to be fair and complete the test
properly we're gonna drop it right on
his face for the last test so here we go
got to get into my shot here and finally
there you go and so that's the damage
done to the front even more cracks and
spiderwebs down on the bottom of the
screen when dropping the Nexus 7 on its
face as you can even see here it gets
even worse because not only that more
cracks happen I've actually exposed part
of the circuitry right underneath so
unfortunately it doesn't fare very well
for the Nexus 7 in terms of a drop
stress test at least when compared to
the original one because they both did
equally as bad and well there you have
it for this nexus 7 drop test it's
really unfortunate and honestly kind of
saddening that the Nexus 7 of this year
still has the same problems that one
last year had when we did that drop test
not only is it inoperable it stopped
working even after the first test and
then a lot of cracks over on the screen
even from different drops even so much
as circuits started to become exposed
from underneath the screen and the build
quality of the back also even though it
feels really nice it also started to
snap off and if I really wanted to this
Nexus 7 could be come to pieces so
unfortunately that's the story of what
the Nexus 7 of 2013 still has a pretty
questionable build quality for drops
bottom line really do not let go of your
Nexus 7 don't let this thing drop
because if it gets a good enough impact
on the floor you could be wound up with
a nice looking break so as always stay
tuned to Android authority for all of
the best coverage and the occasional
drop test whether good or bad
and as always drop us a like down below
