android authority and we are bringing
you the finest vs videos from CES 2013
we were just wanted to do the most
logical comparison of obviously one of
the leading phones in the market just in
terms of raw specs and how sophisticated
is technologically speaking and that's
the droid DNA by HTC on verizon now this
is also going to be an LCD capable
device from Sony who have a lot of
expertise and display technology and in
particular optics so both our 1080p 5
inch displays both have very very
similar physical footprints as you can
see now that's where a few of the
differences end now we have a really
nice curved sort of matt back whereas
with the xperia z we're looking at a
tempered glass so it has a little more
of a classy look but the HTC does feel
really really nice in the hand now it
should be known that the battery is
larger in the xperia z is packing a
2,400 milliamp hour battery vs HTC droid
dna's 2150 in addition to that even
though this does look to be a larger
camera it is actually only an a
megapixel camera whereas on the xperia z
we're looking at a 13 megapixel camera
with Sony's Exmor RS technology
additionally since that is their latest
image sensor it also has on the fly
hardware accelerated HDR video recording
so that means you're able to capture a
lot of high dynamic range video which is
really really cool it's the first time
we've seen this out a particular device
and it's going to be calculated on the
fly and process on the flash so there's
not gonna be any delay afterwards
additionally speaking there is one other
really cool feature which is the fact
that sony has incorporated a dust proof
and water-resistant designs it can be
submerged for up to 30 minutes we're
told both are packing Qualcomm's s4 pro
technology two gigabytes of RAM but we
have two handed sony for including more
advanced optics in their technol into
their smartphones everything is really
really smooth really really fluid it
also has an IR blaster as well which is
really cool so you
control your home audio and your TV and
stuff so we're going to have take a
closer look at a few other devices here
but let us know which one you think is
better HTC's flagship for 2013 the droid
DNA both are really exceptional guys you
have to see these 1080p devices to
really really understand how smooth they
are it's really really impressive in the
hand you know it has a rectangular
design but it feels really really nice
and we've got a big fan of Sony's classy
design nice rectangular feels beautiful
in the hand that's really impressive
dice but we also have an HTC too it's
nice that it has sort of a curved
backing as you can see it's just too bad
that they didn't opt for more advanced
optics so this is the droid DNA vs
xperia z we're android authority
