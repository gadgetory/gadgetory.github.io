authority what's going on everybody
and every photo and video that you're
seeing in this feature focus was taken
on the cameras of the HTC One mini - wow
that's good the selfie game is strong in
this particular camera shootout with the
HTC One mini - as you can see here I'm
just smiling for the camera the five
megapixel front-facing camera but let's
move on to the rear facing camera now
this was a little bit in demand you guys
wanted to see what the HTC One mini twos
camera was like because it's a more
conventional 13 megapixel camera as
opposed to the four ultra pixel camera
of the HTC One m8 and as you'll see you
already have the benefit of the cropping
that is available inside of this camera
and the quality of the pictures actually
is pretty good but we'll just focus on
the cropping for a bit as you see these
100 crops the sharpness is still pretty
much there you do notice a small dip in
the sharpness as you get in there but it
really isn't all that bad and if you
want it to crop your photos using the
pictures from the 13 megapixel shooter
of the HTC One mini - then you you are
actually able to here's a macro shot
that I took with using the macro mode in
the camera and then we go right in you
can actually see quite a bit of detail
on the very inside of this flower so it
was a sunny day out in Carlsbad
California really hot out but and it
provided a lot of great opportunities to
show the broad daylight performance of
this camera and there were just some
really nice opportunities to take
pictures of like the flowers and stuff
out there but you're going to see some
indoor shots a little bit later as I sit
in a coffee shop and you'll see what
that is like but let's go ahead and move
on to some video
so you just watched a couple videos
using the rear facing camera recorded at
1080p resolution and it's worth
mentioning that the front-facing camera
is also capable of doing 1080p
resolution as well so for those bloggers
out there who would like to just do a
quick clip of yourselves say talking
about something or whatever's going on
in your life the audio capture was also
quite good using either of the camera so
that's also a plus it is worth
mentioning though that the camera on the
Mini 2 does not have all of the modes
that originated in the one m8 mainly the
pan 360 and also the Zowie camera so
you're not going to be seeing any short
bursts that which is what the Zowie
camera tends to do along with taking
photos and videos so you're not going to
be seeing those but it is possible to
create the collage or rather the
packaged zoe's from the gallery app and
you're going to see one at the end of
this video so you are so able to create
the zoe's to really kind of commemorate
maybe the day or rather the location or
whatever the particular motif is of your
pictures and videos to create a nice
little package to really reminisce about
those memories we get into the indoor
shots here now and we're at the coffee
house and this was one I saw one picture
that really made me think that this
camera was even more of a decent
performance and I expected it to be at
first I expected it to be a very
conventional photo but then on the
picture of this latte I did a 100 crop
and all of those bubbles were actually
pretty detailed like I actually was
really impressed with what I saw when I
zoomed into this particular photo
the one mode that is available in the
one mini two is the sweep panorama and
I'll go ahead and sweep through this
entire thing right now essentially
you'll see that it is stitched together
really well but there is one caveat and
you'll see it in the sky above right
there where the exposure seems to change
or even the color seems to change a
little bit between the stitching's it's
not that big of a deal but you do notice
it now we have the comparison between
the HTC One mini 2 and its Big Brother
the m8 essentially when you get into the
crops of here you do notice that there's
more of a loss of detail in the m8 not
too much of the loss compared to the
menu 2 as long as you have the
circumstances or rather the scene put
together correctly you will still be
able to get some pretty great photos
with the m8 it's just that the Mini 2
has the benefit of better crops but the
color as you can see there as well the
m8 seems to be a little bit more
optimized I guess is the term to use in
terms of its color reproduction in that
the Mini 2 seems to go for a softer tone
with its colors as opposed to the m8
having a little bit more of a higher
contrast between the colors a little bit
more of a dynamic range all in all
though I think that the pictures between
the two are really great it's just a
matter of what you really need and as
you're going to see right here if you
need low-light performance out of your
phone well the ma just Trump's the Mini
2 which does not do very well in
low-light conditions especially one
compared to the m8 and so there you have
it for this camera shoot out using the
HTC One mini 2 you're seeing the Zoe on
the left side over there so you are
still able to create these montages and
packages from within the gallery app so
that's always really nice I do think
that the camera of the HTC One menu 2 is
a very decent performer and a lot of you
out there might be saying that this is
the camera that should have been on the
m8 but that it really is just a matter
of your opinion so keep it tuned to
