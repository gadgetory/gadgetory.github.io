authority and with the HTC u 11 the
supposed successor to the HTC 10 right
around the corner I think it's only
fitting that we take a look back at the
most underrated flagship of 2016 it's a
phone that definitely deserved a lot
more attention than to God and now
that's a year old let's go ahead and
revisit the HTC 10 and see exactly how
well it's held up this is one year later
with the HTC 10 it really is unfortunate
that the HTC 10 didn't get more
attention from consumers it was pretty
much universally praised by reviewers
which was really good for HTC
considering everything that came between
the m7 and the 10 didn't necessarily
receive the same treatment as good as
the HTC 10 was and still is people just
weren't buying it and aside from tech
journalists and reviewers I've yet to
see the phone being used in the wild by
an average consumer I think I've seen
more LG g5 s in the wild in the HTC 10
and I would partly put that blame on
HTC's marketing or lack thereof it
literally became the best phone of 2016
that people weren't buying which is a
shame because it went toe to toe
extremely well with other flagships on
the market remember when the original
HTC One m7 and the Galaxy S I think it
was the Galaxy s4 at the time where the
two hottest Android phones on the market
with LG delivering a flop last year this
could have been HCC's moment to capture
that magic again but there just wasn't
enough of a push behind this device for
HTC to really capitalize on that
opportunity I still think it's a very
attractive looking phone and easily one
of my favorite designs from 2016 the
metal body feels incredible in the hand
and the huge chamfer along the back is a
very unique touch that I wished HTC
wasn't so quick to get rid of the front
of the phone was completely clean and
free of any logos or branding which is
honestly how it always should be for any
smartphone but something I truly
appreciated about the HTC 10 was how
easy it was to use in one hand it has a
very small footprint and despite having
an all-metal body it was easy to hold on
to because of the flat sides in terms of
the phone's durability I didn't exactly
baby this phone and while it does have
some minor Nicks and scrapes which by
the way is much more noticeable on the
matte black version overall it's still
in great shape especially for never
being in a
case I'm also a huge fan of the display
normally I prefer AMOLED but HTC has
always done an excellent job with LCD I
personally think their phones have the
best cell TV panels on the market I love
how vibrant sharp and contrast II this
display is and if you didn't know any
better you would think that this is an
AMOLED screen just because of how bright
and colorful it looks one thing that did
change rather significantly on the HTC
10 from previous HTC phones is the audio
experience no I'm not talking about the
headphone jack that feature did remain
intact and actually provide some very
high quality audio with the built-in DAC
and amp I'm referring to the speakers
the HTC 10 went for one front firing
speakers and a bottom facing woofer
instead of dual front-facing speakers it
turned out to not be such a bad change
but I do miss having front-facing
speakers a feature that has sort of
disappeared entirely from smartphones
performance even after a year is still
quite good in my experience while the
specs aren't the flagship standard
anymore it's still very snappy and
responsive even after several software
updates speaking of updates the phone
did receive an update to Android newgate
and is also fairly up-to-date with
Android security patches this update
also brought Google Assistant on board
but aside from the features and
enhancements that you gain from nougat
the experience feels pretty much the
same as it was when the HTC 10 was on
marshmallow that's mostly because HTC
Sense hasn't changed all that much and
although Sense is still one of the
cleanest Android experiences it does
feel like it needs a little bit of a
refresh which hopefully we'll see on the
u 11 battery life on the other hand has
not really held up that well but I never
really thought that battery life on the
HTC 10 was amazing by any stretch of the
imagination and the 3000 milliamp hour
battery is pretty average by today's
standards and it never really got me
through a full day especially not with
heavy use it does however have quick
charge 3.0 which is really nice so
getting this phone back up and running
was never really that big of a deal
where HTC historically has struggled a
lot with is the camera department but
that changed pretty drastically with the
HTC 10 while I still feel like this
camera was a step behind its 2016
flagship counterparts from LG and
Samsung it's leaps and bounds better
than what we saw on the m7 m8 and M
I know that may not sound like it's
saying much but this is a really good
camera and I forgot how good this camera
was until I started using it again even
digging back through a lot of the old
photos that I took on this phone when it
was brand new the photos are a lot
better than what I initially remembered
it also has manual controls and the
ability to shoot in RAW so you have a
lot of flexibility here when it comes to
shooting photos the front-facing camera
is also quite good and it featured
optical image stabilization a feature
that I'm not entirely sure why we don't
see more of on front-facing cameras it's
perfect if you love taking selfies and
it's an even better camera if you're
into vlogging and speaking of vlogging
we have someone on the team who did
quite a bit of vlogging on the HTC 10 on
top of many other things of course so
let's go ahead and kick it over to him
and see exactly what he has to say about
the HTC 10 you already know who it is
it's mr. Joshua veigar himself these are
all really great points my lawn and I
wanted to chime in to give my thoughts
on the HTC 10 as well because it might
be my favorite phone from last year now
there are a couple of really big reasons
for that and one of them is because of
the vlogging experience the OS enabled
front-facing camera proved to be a
pretty good tool for a couple of vlogs
that I did on my personal channel called
Tekken T and you've been watching a
couple of those clips right now putting
away s on the front-facing camera was
just one of the many things that HTC
actually got right with the ten
including the metal build the Android
iteration which is one of my favorites
actually and then of course there's the
headphone jack experience now I'm
wearing my audio technica m50x is right
now and they were incredibly fun to use
on the HTC ten and it was because of
that that I made the realisation I
listen to music and podcasts on smart
phones way more often than I use them as
main cameras and it's because of that
that I gravitated to the HTC 10 and its
third-party DAC and built-in amp and
that's the reason why this phone is
actually one of the most memorable
experiences I had from 2016
so hopefully the upcoming the follow-up
rather to the HTC 10 is going to
continue this legacy but based upon what
HTC is doing right now well you know we
could feel a little bit skeptical but
one thing is for certain the HTC 10
deserves its place as a classic of 2016
the biggest question here is is the HTC
10 still worth buying in 2017 well if
you get it direct from HTC it's still
pretty expensive
if you can get it for a good deal on
third-party sites like Amazon I would
say go for it it's a fantastic phone
that has aged very well and it isn't
missing a whole lot even when compared
to the most current of flagship it
certainly deserves to be in more
people's pockets especially if you
cherish that classic HCC metal build and
design consider what we've seen so far
from HTC this year the HTC 10 looks to
be the end of that era so I would get
your hands on one while you still can
as always thank you guys so much for
