this is clayton over at android
authority calm and today we're going to
be checking out an app now this is the
hey check application which is a photo
sharing app that you can use in
conjunction with your facebook account
to easily share your photos so without
further ado we'll just check it out so
here's the main screen on hey check you
see you've got your camera gallery
instagram and facebook options these are
four tiles here as well as the my feet
and profile page the my feed contains
all of the different photos that you may
have from your friends that are using
this application when you login with
your facebook and here's your profile
you can see i've uploaded 0 photos as of
now and no one's following me and I
don't have any followers this is where
that would be displayed so anyways this
is your capturing options you can either
take a picture with your camera choose
one that's already existing in your
gallery take a picture or choose one in
your Instagram gallery and then you load
a photo to Facebook so just for the heck
of it I'm going to click the gallery and
show you the user interface fair okay so
here we've got a list of pictures I have
I'll just choose this one it's a
background for the Galaxy Nexus now when
you get to the pictures you can select
it and you can write a title you can
edit the picture using the photo editor
down here possibly remove redeye if
you've got that in any of your pictures
and choose the bordering you can also
choose to delete it anyways when you're
done with that you can click done and it
will post a photo to your facebook
automatically so if you go to the
Facebook you can see that it's loading
up and it has this all of my friends
there and the photo is posted it'll let
you know when that happened so now you
can go to your Facebook
you can see that has one photo and then
under my feet it'll show what I've
posted now there's all these different
emoticons that you can put for the
caption of the photo and you can also
write a comment and pull down to release
and refresh so that was a hey check
application guys if you're looking for a
photo aggregator that can put all of
your photo sources into one and upload
it to Facebook for you easily i would
suggest checking this one out and stay
tuned with android authority calm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
