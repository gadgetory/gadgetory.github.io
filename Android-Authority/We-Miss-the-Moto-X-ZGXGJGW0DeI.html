not talking about the one that we just
saw a couple of weeks ago at Aoife in
Berlin I'm talking about the original
the one that came after Google acquired
Motorola before Lenovo came into the
picture well we're going to take a look
at what made the Moto X so well liked
it's Joshua for Gaara
what's going on everybody and this is a
look back at the Moto X now before we
get started I do want to direct you to
an article that has already been
published on Android 30.com by Adam Dowd
he dives further into the Moto maker
that I will touch upon later in my video
and you can go and read that wonderful
article over at Android authority comm
also don't forget to tell us what you
think about this topic and let us know
what you feel about the Moto X the
current one or even the old ones in the
comments below the Moto X was a little
bit of a departure from what people knew
of Motorola at the time and it was a
little bit more in tune with the image
of Google and Android that we were
starting to really like a clean inside
meant that the phone was rocking a very
lean version of Android the concept was
further popularized later on by the
Nexus and then the pixel line a user
experience that is as close to minimal
stock Android as possible
moto did put in a few of their own
additions including the moto actions and
of course the moto voice as it was
called touchless control on the original
Moto X where you were able to say okay
Google now in order to activate the
device Thoreau on top of that B moto
display and you have what is basically
the precursor to the always-on display
as we see on LG and Samsung devices as
well as the ambient display that you'll
see in other kind of stock Android
iterations so moto wasn't necessarily a
pioneer when it came to all of these
features but they were one of the first
ones to make them incredibly fun and
incredibly practical but then came the
icing on the cake moto maker
customization is almost a given in the
Android world as fans really enjoy
making Android pretty much anything that
we want it to be but when it came to the
outer look of the phone there wasn't
much differentiating all of the
different plastic designs and then if
you kind of fast forward to today's
landscape all of the metal and glass
phones that we have moto sought to
change that with the Moto maker a way of
customizing the X that included colors
and materials for the bag that ranged
from traditional plastic to even leather
now quick story if you followed me here
at Android authority back in around 2014
you would know that bamboo backs were
kind of my jam however to get the review
done I had to use this plastic black
version of the phone and I was a little
bit salty about it at the time but with
the next iteration of the Moto X I was
actually able to finally get the bamboo
backing along with an inscription on the
bottom that was my life's motto and
honestly that's what really made the
Moto X so popular back then
personalization smart phones especially
flagship phones really found a stride
after the Moto X 2015 pictured here and
the thing is all of those phones
continue to be really recognizable for
one big reason the designs haven't
exactly changed from year to year since
2015
not a whole lot at least at least with
the Moto line in 2015 there was a chance
to change things up not just because the
company was iterating but because it was
something you wanted this time around
don't get me wrong
there are remnants of the Moto maker
that are still found today only they are
in the successor to the Moto X line the
Moto Z has a number of attachable
backings that changes look effectively
but it is almost literally a band-aid
compared to the actual hardware level
changes that the Moto maker provided and
if you're using a mod then you're
basically just adding more bulk to the
Moto Z so up until this point we thought
that the Moto Z was all we were going to
get rumors of the Moto X returning were
kind of abound right before Aoife and
then we finally got our hands on it and
this is what we got this is the Moto X
2017 or better known as the Moto X for a
metal and glass design that tries to
look a lot like the original X but just
seems different it's almost like the
phone is a moto Z trying to masquerade
as an X for example the front has that
fingerprint reader that's not quite a
home button because there are soft keys
and the overall design is something that
we've seen in numerable times with other
phones it is smaller than the Moto Z so
it does have that in terms of ergonomics
but otherwise there's very little
differentiating this phone from even the
rest of the devices in Moto's lineup so
you have the Moto Z that is the high-end
flagship that uses the Moto Maude's and
then you have the Moto G and the Moto e
which are mid-range and budget devices
respectively so where does the Moto X
fall aside from a really cool multiple
Bluetooth audio stack made by tempo
there really isn't a whole lot that
differentiates the Moto X or really
makes it exciting it's decidedly
mid-range and its specifications when
users are demanding the absolute best
and greatest more than ever plainly put
the Moto X has been put into a state of
limbo and the one thing that could have
made it exciting even on par with the
Moto Z is that level of personalization
that we
once had years ago imagine the motox
that came back with even singular parts
of the Moto maker like for example a
different choice when it comes to the
backings maybe there's a leather version
or maybe there's a wood version and it
would literally be the only device that
actually tries to be different without
relying on covers or cases these days we
are basically at the whim of the phone
companies and their hardware choices
camera bumped this home button that
fingerprint reader here and only some
colors available there and the Moto X
was one of the few phones that actually
tried to give some of that control back
to the user that's not to say that the
Moto X is a bad phone per se we still
have to test it and give our full review
but it only has a couple of main
features that differentiate it from even
other Motorola devices and holding that
phone in my hand at Aoife for our hands
on I couldn't help but remember what was
and wonder what could have been and I
always came back to the same thought
each and every time I miss the Moto X</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
