authority and i just wanted to show you
one of my new favorite notification apps
it's kind of like a task manager but it
doesn't tap into google tasks it's
called note if you'll see it right here
in the bottom right hand in my app
drawer and what note of what you do is
it lets you create custom notifications
for your pull down bar if you're running
a jellybean device simply open up notif
and you'll see that it's designed in a
beautiful hollow format using all the
Android design guidelines there's a
settings menu right here that lets you
pick just a couple of things you can
close the app after creating a
notification tell you what priority or
set what priority the notification
should be in and choose the theme I'm
currently running the dark theme right
now there's also a light theme that is
pretty much the inverse of this it uses
a lot of whites grays silvers and blues
you'll notice right here that it's
mostly excuse me dark grays the
occasional hollow blue color and then
this orange that he uses in his logo
hopping right into how the app actually
functions you can create four kinds of
notifications a default one a big text
one a big picture one and a list now all
of these have some fairly standard
options in them you can choose what icon
you'd like them to be you'll see that
there's only what 20 icons right here
you can also make them an ongoing
notification if you would like for every
notification you want to create you
simply fill out the text title content
there's a big content box you fill it
out you hit the plus button for big text
you can do a title and expanded title
and then content for big picture title
expanded title content and then you can
either take a photo or get a photo from
your gallery right now there is a
persistent bug that if you choose to
take a photo from within not've it won't
be high quality so i would suggest
getting a photo from your gallery that
you've taken outside of not've my
personal favorite is a list where you
can have a title and then a series of
list items list summer and reduced
content now the reason I'm not making
these right now is because I've already
made four of them one of each just for
times sake so I can show you guys real
quick how it works so starting at the
bottom you'll see this is the default
notification hello this is the simplest
notification it doesn't expand
simply has a title and then one single
line of text something pretty short the
one that's titled good morning android
authority that's our big text one right
there so you notice at the title right
now is good morning android authority
this is an example of a big text
notification just like the new swiping
things if you swipe down on it you can
expand it the title changes to the
subtitle that you set which is a smiley
face in this case and I wrote this is an
example of a big text notification you
can type more than one line of text so
if you need to write a dissertation for
yourself you're in luck seriously the
brevity is a virtue the big picture one
acts just like a picture if you've taken
it using the camera app it shows you a
small I guess preview of the picture
you've taken I said this is a picture
now the cool thing about big picture
notifications is that they to expand and
you can do approximately one lab text I
said a picture's worth a thousand words
so there's nothing that needs to be said
but it shows you the picture in a large
format this is a camera messenger bag
that I really really like and then the
last one is a list and I just titled a
demo list nice to take critical video
take note of video and write app reviews
and otherwise that's it I made all of
them persistent notification so you
can't swipe them away you'll notice that
they just kind of jelly back like if
you've missed a call and if you want to
clear persistent notifications you
simply hit these two flag icons right
here are you sure you want to clear any
notifications delete them and you'll
notice that the only thing I have now is
my google now remind you telling me that
the cowboys are playing today there is
an option to go pro and going pro opens
up all sorts of different things like
over 200 icon icons that you can pick
and things like that and it looks like
it costs a mere 99 cents however if
you're pretty low-maintenance like
myself notif is free by default so if
you're looking for a great notification
modifier app I would recommend note if
it's in the google play store and you
can get it for free</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
