Patriots Invitational cup airs this
Sunday February 3rd on CBS and most
people will probably tune in this Sunday
through standard cable television but in
this day and age there are a ton of apps
and services that allow you to cut the
cord and still let you watch TV shows
and live sports so we're gonna go over
some of the best options out there that
are gonna let you stream the Super Bowl
this upcoming Sunday so since the Super
Bowl is being aired on CBS this year you
can actually watch the Super Bowl
directly from the CBS sports app this
app is available on Google Play
completely free of charge and you'll be
able to stream the game completely free
there's no sign-in or subscription
required just download the application
and you'll be able to watch the game
from anywhere on any one of your mobile
devices in addition to the CBS sports
app you also have CBS all access CBS all
access gives you access to NFL games and
also access to all of CBS's current and
completed shows like the Big Bang Theory
NCIS The Late Show with Stephen Colbert
the list goes on and on the service cost
anywhere between 6 to 10 dollars per
month but it does offer a 7-day free
trial if you haven't taken advantage of
that yet next up on the list is YouTube
TV YouTube TV offers over 40 channels
has cloud DVR and also has chromecast
support it costs $40 per month which is
not really that bad of a deal and again
also offers a 7-day free trial if you
want to test it out for yourself and see
if you like the service another really
popular option is going to be hulu hulu
is a really diverse streaming service
that lets you stream TV shows movies
animes etc there's a bunch of things
that you can watch on hulu pricing
starts at five ninety nine to eleven
nine per month the live TV starts at $40
per month and will offer over 50
channels and you can add in additional
channels for extra money
it also has chromecast support and
there's also a 7-day free trial for the
live TV service next up is playstation
view and playstation view is probably as
close as you're going to get to cable
television on the internet the service
cost between 40
to $75 per month and as you go up in
tier you get access to more and more
channels the mobile app needs a little
bit of work but it does work most of the
time and it also has chromecast support
this service is a really great service
for cutting the cord even if you don't
actually own a Playstation DIRECTV now
is another really great option that also
cost between forty to seventy five
dollars per month the base package will
get you over 65 channels and you can
also add in additional premium channels
like HBO and stars for around five to
eight dollars it's a great service that
provides a ton of value and definitely
shouldn't be overlooked last but not
least is fubo TV and fubo TV is another
service that costs between forty to
seventy five dollars per month and
provides a ton of value for example the
$45 package gives you 81 channels which
is quite a bit of channels and is a
pretty good deal there's even optional
add-ons that will give you nothing but
sports channels and this is a really
great TV service if you're big into
sports so that promotion wraps it up for
this list these are some really great
options that are worth considering if
you plan on watching these Super Bowl
this Sunday thanks for watching this
video I hope you guys enjoyed it please
