Angela thority and we're taking another
quick look at the Samsung Galaxy s6 edge
more specifically the actual edge itself
and the functionality that it brings so
the first thing you're going to notice
is that the s6 edge has an edge on both
sides which is different from the note 4
edge which only had one and this so you
don't have to flip the phone upside down
whether your left or right-handed
instead you can pick whether you want
the edge features on the left or right
edge but you can't use both so you'll
have to decide which side works best for
you the first feature that Samsung has
been hyping up is the people edge and
the people edge places a tab on the
upper portion of the edge that gives you
access to five of your favorite or most
frequent contacts and you can call them
or message them right from this edge
it'll also place additional tabs that
correspond to each person on your people
edge whenever you have a missed call or
text message from them which I thought
was pretty cool and you can also respond
to calls and messages from the edge as
well also if you happen to have your
phone face down the edge will light up
anytime you get a call and you can
easily dismiss it simply by putting your
finger on the heartrate monitor on the
back the second thing you can do with
the edge is use it as an information
stream so you can have things like
weather news social feeds like Twitter
show up and if you see something you
want to read further in-depth you can
tap on it and it will take you to the
respective application various
notifications like emails text messages
missed calls can also be set up to show
up here since the screen is AMOLED the
edge can also be used as a night clock
and you can set this night clock to come
on at a specific time at night so you
never have to worry about remembering to
turn it on when you go to bed and
because of that AMOLED screen it's going
to draw very little power I guess the
best part about all of these edge
features is that Samsung gives you the
ability to turn them all off if you
don't like them but doing so almost
defeats the purpose of the edge designed
to begin with
either way this has been a quick look of
the edge features of the s6 edge as
always keep tuned here to Android
