it was kind of up to me to find the
place but lon and Darcy god bless them
just kept telling me we're sick of tapas
and I said yes all there is exactly it
really is ready in Spain in Barcelona I
tapas is all they have here okay that's
pretty much it yeah you could go to a
steak house and they'll give it to you
on a small plate I mean come on man but
funny so how's how's everybody been it's
been a couple weeks since we've been on
the cast I've had a couple of late
releases I hope everyone's been okay
with that but well house how how have my
regular co-host bin since this mwc
season is finally like died down a bit
um not bad actually I had a really I
feel so bad like I've everybody who is
that you know who did mwc 2015 stuff I
did the least I did almost nothing I did
the rig in uh the hd2 the live blogs
that but yeah I did that's it that's all
I did for him to PC 2015 that only way
morganite what I did to be honest I only
got a couple posts as well yeah yeah I
didn't do squat man I felt so bad
everyone's like I'm so busy work at like
16 hour days I'm like I oh I spent the
whole day watching anime and handle my
girlfriend felt so bad I'm glad you
didn't message us that that was all
happening with you yeah I would have
probably like shot you in the face
Oh III kept quiet I think I was just
like you know I'm just gonna let them go
and just kind of hang out back here in
the back I did oh I did do a whole bunch
of apolis videos though i think i did
like 10 of them i did notice that kudos
to you man it's a lot of hard work I
wanted to get them all out before all
the mwc stuff so that way you know it
wasn't like mwc video mwc video app list
why now we've been fine and be nice
change of pace you're just hearing me
and lon all damn day like man lon hit
the 1 million mark I'm proud of the guy
I am super shout out to lon like we we
we have such a great time like this is
probably the happiest i personally have
ever been at a trade show because i
finally was able to split the work with
somebody I I was happiest I've ever been
and I wasn't there just because just
because uh you know things got out so
super quick it was so smooth oh yeah
from the you know because from them me
an administrators point of view and it
was it was great i loved it i mean yeah
i was busy I mean my busiest days were
Sunday obviously and i think tuesday
which might seem like an odd day for me
it i've been busiest but i think that's
when a lot of the videos were coming in
maybe yes i'm still early Tuesday I
worked like 16 hours ya know those were
the days i mean that no yeah then sunday
was crazy i think sunday was like it was
like oh I was about to say day 0 was
just a crazy fest and just it was course
you know yeah yeah you had so many
videos that day you were doing and Oh
again I gotta say being able to split
the work with somebody thank the
freaking Lord and I can't imagine how
you did it especially with like Samsung
bringing out the edge and all that and I
remember at the beginning of that little
like brief that we have so we can get
the footage early I just looked at lon
and I'm like dude which one do you want
and he was like I guess I'll take the
edge but yeah I mean um yeah that d0 was
nuts because it wasn't just all the pre
briefings I mean um brushy you've been
there with us on the on I in the
trenches like you know how it is when
certain events are going on like like
the pep come and show stoppers the thing
is they were all scheduled for that one
Sunday
yeah it was I looked at our schedule it
was pretty booked yeah exactly and like
even that pep com that was at the end of
the day when we went over there everyone
else that we knew all of our tech
friends were out at Samsung's uh event
still and kind of like three-quarters of
them didn't even show up to pep com i
texted a michael fisher and i was just
like dude like where you at man we got
we got to have like a glass of wine or
something because it's been a hard day
he's like oh we totally forgot about pep
kong was like oh man that's just how
hard that day was but it wasn't saturday
was pretty busy from our point of view
just because we were doing all that you
know pre you know pre stuff the perhaps
yeah all the prep stuff in the
background I mean there was somebody
stuff so much stuff to do there but it
wasn't as long I think I worked maybe 10
10 to 12 hours which isn't that big of a
deal yeah I juice I do I knew something
was gonna be so bad for you guys when
krushi messaged me he's like did anyone
talk to you I thought I was getting
fired at for every time someone says
have you been talked to yet that's the
first I think oh my god I'm being fired
but it was like no yeah you want to do
the HTC and Samsung live blogs right I
was like yeah sure he guys all right
yeah once in a 10 and the other ones it
like noon I was like okay yeah which
days they're both on Sunday what yeah
yeah yeah they're do it there now take
everything on the same day I am trust us
when we woke up that morning and we
looked at the schedule cuz okay Dorsey
thing thank God for Darcy because he's
able to put together all this stuff that
allows us to get the content and then
you know it's just this nice well-oiled
machine but the one thing Darcy didn't
do during this particular show that he
does every show was Google cow me a week
before um yes I don't think I didn't get
it until I mean I got it probably before
you then when did you get it I got it
the morning of sunday wow I got it a
little before you I think he's send it
on Friday night yeah I mean I don't want
to known that I would have said but I
assumed you'd be the first person he
gave a cup oh my goodness like we had we
have never known that I would have sent
you a copy but it wasn't his copy wasn't
very good initially I mean it was
missing some things oh sure I dine in
the dates were the times for wrong on
half of it could get confused like we
had the zone we had a call like a few
days prior and he told me that you know
everything's kind of falling at the same
time so yeah we were kind of prepared
for it but when I looked at it on this
sunday morning after
like having my bulletproof coffee I was
like so Nava babe oh yeah i'm sure you
guys do i'm sure you didn't sleep at all
that day right um i'm trying to remember
coming up as a battle i haven't heard
much from feisty over there man like
what like you said that you did even
less than Joe so this is your this is
your your midseason evaluation what took
in the fair because of his time zone and
because the fact that Jimmy and I are
both on the central time zone everything
was pretty much done by the time the
poor guy was around though so what you
know how did you pass the time uh during
uh during mwc season what was worried up
to this past couple weeks you know I've
been spending the majority of my time
tap tap x absolutely that's right our
new sister site although tablets and and
you know completely immersing myself in
it we got the new writers going on there
and that's it you know it's been I want
to say exciting but hey we're moving
forward going strong so yeah definitely
everybody check out tap x also as my
note for starts ringing who is calling
Oh number I don't know hang up okay so
clean just like a just like bruh she was
saying I mean kudos to him and Jimmy
let's be honest that every time I popped
in and like hey what's there for me to
cover how can I help brushy was like you
know what we got this you're fine and
then you know the three o'clock in the
morning comes along I'm ready to close
it you know close it down and he's like
ooh could you do just one more for me or
bogdan's getting on and he's like hey
would you mind just one before you go so
C by bogdan etta show has this really
interesting way of being because he gets
on and he starts talking to all of you
guys and then he doesn't necessarily get
like stressed out but it seems like it
but because the way that bogdan reacts
to like his eyes getting tired and stuff
like that is he puts his like head in
his hands and you started getting really
hard is like it really throws us for a
loop because like me and lana like you
okay dude and then bogdan's like no I'm
okay it's okay guys it's okay you know
in his head he was going Tam Americans
cheese and all right ah man I oh so what
I have I have to mention like this might
be the first show that I'm actually
super excited about what's to come like
did you guys see my video on the HTC
vive I did not that's I missed most of
the NDMC videos oh no problem like I've
watched every single one we don't have
to go through that length but this is a
VR platform that I can actually believe
in and having valve at the helm I mean
HTC helps with the hardware and of
course some of the software but valve is
creating these experiences that you're
going to have completely immersive
experience like I am I gonna get into it
too much but let's just say once you put
that VR headset on the headphones and
then you put the controllers in your
hands the room you were standing in
before you put that all that crap on it
disappears and you are all of a sudden
in this crazy world the controllers are
like your hands in the world you're
picking everything up and you know we're
mostly gamers up in here and we're gonna
get to that in a little bit but the
final dent part of the demo the final
world that they showed us was aperture
and you had to repair a portal robot it
was freaking amazing and of course
you're set up to fail cuz GLaDOS is like
when when when the walls come down and
GLaDOS like zooms in on you and
basically tells you she's gonna kill you
you piss your pants like that that's how
immersive that thing is but super super
exciting to see at mwc that i finally
got excited about something again you
know like I love smartphones I love what
we do for a living but it's good to
finally walk out of a room that you get
some sort of demo of something before
everybody else in the world and you're
super excited for them to try it you
know so good but on that note as we look
toward the future from mwc we're looking
back at our past like that Segway hey
nice today we're talking origin stories
and we just had a little check in there
so if you guys are are enjoying our ftp
we're back in the studio and back to our
memory studio but studios and back to
our regularly scheduled programming this
week thank God for grush II picked a
pretty light one for us we're talking
about our tech
origin stories what got us into tech and
what God is essentially to where we are
now let's see here alright so I kind of
wanted to just open up the panel you can
go as far back as you want when you were
a kid that's what I'm gonna do a little
bit later back when you were a kid what
were the first pieces of technology that
really loved and kind of kind of you
know what what made you fall in love
with this world of technology that we
all now in one way or another report on
and make a living off of I'm going to
open it up even if there's a little bit
of silence you guys can figure out who's
gonna start so yeah let's uh let's open
it up who wants to start off with their
origin story in tech um I've actually
been thinking about this all day because
um I haven't had anything else to do
today I have like the show to do
tomorrow so I've really been thinking
you know mwc stunner I know I don't know
it sounds like I'm so lazy like I do
others things just you know anyways um I
actually didn't start out as a tech nerd
I started out as a regular nerd like
magic the gathering and Dungeons and
Dragons and like wearing shirts with
like pokemon on them which I'm actually
still doing right now as we speak but I
actually which my own my first computer
or like you know like all my game
systems I share with my brother
throughout my childhood it's like I
didn't have any electronics that were my
own until I was like 20 years old I was
like eight years ago and um yeah it's it
felt weird like getting into technology
cuz like you know I was with all the
family computers and stuff like that I
was always the person that had to fix
all that stuff but I was never really
all that into it so you know I got a
computer and then a few years later I
got my first android device and i don't
know i just kind of like don't really
okay Joe we need we need details up in
here all right what computer was this
what phones are we talking about man
well what are some of these electronics
that you shared with your bro I figured
we were gonna get into the details later
my bad that's my bad um co the consoles
that's a long list I see my brother and
I had
an xbox the PlayStation 2 PlayStation
Super Nintendo we had I swear to god one
of those Nintendo VR things you know
remember those love virtual virtual boy
we had a virtual boy and it does it's
what I said yeah that was an interesting
system that was a thing system was not
awful it's behind me in that I have a
little cabinet behind me it's in there
that thing was responsible for every
headache I had between the ages of 9 and
10 it was so bad but it was so it gives
really bad it was so fun to play was
like it was so painful it's like
drinking too much alcohol it's like the
night before you're like yeah gonna get
wasted the next morning you're like oh
why did I get so wasted and like the
virtual boy is exactly the same way like
man would play some virtual boy
afterwards like oh man what I play that
virtual boy it was so bad um may I
pretty much every major game console
that came out between like 1990 and 20
whatever 20 2004 where my brother and I
split one my first computer was Shh wrap
I can't remember it was an HP POS like
dual core blah-de-blah like that was
that was an official name of the
computer should I kept POS HP HP POS
Intel something or other clock did
something or other well yeah I had that
one too yeah I was a good machine yeah
that's such a great laptop it was like I
say are you sure it was a dual core back
then oh yeah eight years ago was how
long ago were you talk oh it was only
eight years okay I guess yeah 2007 okay
that's why was what was the buzzword
core 2 duo was something I guess I was I
guess I'm thinking when you talk about
old computers I'm thinking oh ya think
we had like a family computer but like
when I was like but you don't member
what it was uh no it was a compact white
brick with like one button on the front
and it's a compaq presario it wasn't a
presario it was like the off it wasn't
that's about all they know is the office
presario brand it was like two hundred
dollars even back then but um it was
like a you know my dad was married back
then we had there's five kids in the
house so like we
had to like schedule time on that thing
at you know we all do school work and
stuff like that so I didn't get to like
play games on computers or anything like
that my mom had a gateway and i played
diablo 2 on that for a long time nice
but it was like you know i was only up
there every other weekend and during the
summer so it's like most of the year I
wasn't there playing it um but yeah I
know with my first computer i started
tinkering around with some stuff uh I
got a lot of really crappy technology
and believe it or not that's what like
really sparked my interest I got a hard
drive that was a jpod enclosure you guys
remember when that was a thing no I I
was so crabby most people even know what
it is um I was too hard drives in a
single enclosure right so it's like a
one terabyte one terabyte in a single
enclosure and it was like this ji it was
called j-bot I can't remember exactly
what it was or what it did but it was
just essentially a raid 0 in an external
hard yeah the way sounds like a lotion
store your data and rejuvenate your skin
with Jay bod sorry exfoliate but yeah so
yeah like I kept buying the CEO really
crappy old technology to get breaking it
was really terrible um and then I got my
first android phone speaking of crappy
and terrible technology it was a
motorola click click oh my god was my
first android phone and i ended up
having to get three different ones
because the radio kept dying and it
wasn't like I was a newbie and stupid
and didn't understand what's going on I
mean like the little thingy at the top
would go away entirely and I could not
make any phone calls text messages or
get data at all it was just totally dead
and the cool thing was every time I sent
one back they sent it back to me with
the SD card and everything so I had like
I still have most of life like three or
four two gigabyte microSD cards just
sitting over here that I never use no
man talk about POS yeah yeah those can't
even hold like for apps these days oh
man that was back when like motoblur was
like really bad
like really really bad did they have a
refresh of motoblur at one point back
then that was like really well-received
though like it was like what was one of
the first ones to have the heads of
notifications am I in my remote that was
like a verizon the first couple of
generations of the droid razr series
still had motoblur and it was actually
somewhat yeah motoblur I remember
actually i got i had a uh I droid
something or other something rather it
was frightened I I bought it off of ebay
because I was doing something on the XDA
forums cuz that's you know it's where I
kind of got the really hardcore into
Android was there I started rooting my
devices and all that stuff uh but I
bought one just because they said it was
like really difficult to root and that's
like that was my thing back there's like
all it's so hard to root I'm gonna root
the crap out of it it wasn't the
incredible was no it was the it was
after the incredible I'm sorry it was ok
wasn't three sound that was HTC anyway
holy crap I can't believe I'm blanking
on this so bad he said Troy that's why
it was it was oh my goodness it was
before the quad cores came out I
remember that I'm gonna go look that up
real quick somebody else talk for a
second all right well yeah well we got
into the Android world would y'all ready
when we pop it over to feisty like what
what we don't hear a whole lot about
like or our pass a whole lot I'm really
interested to hear how feisty got
started in tech right now tech what's
that he's Amish was the technology man
talking about can right now to wire this
connect all I'm straight up Amish bro
yeah the way I've been shaving lately be
hard to prove otherwise but oh my god
I'm shaving sorry sorry bud oh my god
Bionic sorry go ahead bud I just wanted
to get that out sorry no problem I you
know for me technology got started
really young from more of a mechanical
perspective you know my dad had these
are sea and don't tell my dad you know
this isn't going public is it yeah he
had a remote control car it was you know
allemand type race car
oh nice I took a screwdriver to that
thing I ripped it open i took broke it
right down almost nothing built it back
up I don't think he ever knew and you
know that was early on I mean like I
barely remember doing this and I mean I
always sort of ripping things apart
stereos TVs VCRs you know all that kind
of stuff I just you know it was tearing
them apart and then that was fun for me
at one of those you know 201 electronics
kits has got all the you know the diodes
capacitors all that kind of stuff on it
all you do is connect the little wires
and then push the button and it makes a
noise and then you rearrange the wires
he pushed a button and makes another
noise you know but yeah I got bored with
that stuff pretty quick but hey what the
era was fun it was educational right you
know one of the big things for us in our
family there's five kids in our family
so we shared most everything but we had
this one little I want to call it a
computer now but this was like before
the days of you know before anybody you
know Intel was a household brand we're
talking well beyond that it was just a
little voice prompt you know children's
toy basically you know you choose these
modes and you know guess the number and
it would put to you know a simple one
plus one kind of mathematical equation
and you know you just learn from it but
you know we all ran through that thing
it was kind of a neat start but I mean
again that was youngster stuffin and
then you grow up right high school comes
along bigger stereo huberty puberty a
major driver for me especially through
all my teenage years into my curly 20s
was music now my friends were always big
on video games and yeah I've go over
their place and you know watch for the
entertainment value or play whatever
happened to be NHL 94 come on all the
time we tournaments but you know for me
it was music was really the big
motivator for me for technology and then
you know through high school I I kick
myself now but I made fun of the
computer nerds you know i was playing
sports on the basketball team that sort
of stuff
was it but really but yeah yeah so you
know I've got you know half way through
high school then I realized hey wait a
minute there's something to these
computers and I finally purchased my
first one after high school you know
kind of like Joe was saying just a you
know as a custom build at the time my
friend's dad was you know just starting
up his own shop it was the first
generation pentium processor with an 8
gigabyte hard drive that was I tell you
I could almost load webpages you sure
was a pentium one with a 8 gigabyte hard
drive that sounds not right by the
opinion to probably I remember yeah that
had to be more like a penny of two or
three that can't be a god I'm getting
like the weirdest flashbacks right sorry
yes i'm a super nerd you know I never
really looked back on that thing and it
burnt out but I hereby tossed it so what
year was it that would have been 99 so
yeah that'd be like a pen yeah d by
pentium to literally even remember that
we good lord i'm just getting started on
99 come on the 1999 was like WWE WWF
back then and I was like Chris Jericho
is really huge back thing because the
y2j thing oh man don't get me started on
wrestling did i watch his debut the
other day I was his first one is
first-rate yeah and how the the crouch
end when he interrupted the rabbinate
the crowd you started chanting rocky and
ignored him for five minutes yeah
exactly so okay oh man let me possibly
make you guys jealous you remember a
Bret the Hitman Hart and Owen Hart those
guys yeah yeah they're from they're from
Calgary I didn't grow up with those boys
but just after high school the first job
I got they were regulars and would go
out down to the gym the wrestle with
them and stuff yeah oh man that's crazy
so badass um voila the Ju just reminded
me of us i'm not into wrestling but
while i was working years ago as a as a
manager for mcdonald's as a store
manager for
while anyway during college and we in
our little small town mcdonalds on the
interstate we had John Cena coming in so
I've met him before no rush he follows
up bread to him and heart with like John
Cena like well I just you reminded me of
wrestling so I just I just think I got
thinking about that that's all he's like
it's like it's like it's like
fashionable right now to call John Cena
lame that's why it's funny oh and it's
so funny yeah i just gotta bump into my
head that's all that's really good old
I'm not into wrestling at all but well I
got in real life John Cena is actually
like a really dope dude that's what I
keep hearing but anyway feisty was
talking about pentium tues and a
gigabyte hard drives like so so what was
the what was the evolution into mobile
then if you started off with like you
know desktop computers you said music
actually know what let's go back to the
music thing how did music actually form
like formulate your your your tech life
if like back in high school and whatnot
you were saying well basically stereos I
was into all things now at this port
keep in mind mechanical you know
throughout high school I was you know
one of the top dogs in the at the high
school was mechanics class and you know
I was going to national competitions and
stuff for turning wrenches not that most
you know not the proudest time in my
life but you know that's what I was into
it was it as a gearhead at the time and
that was cool so you know I was always
playing with putting in car stereos and
bigger speakers and and then in the
house it was always you know what stereo
should I get what speakers what's up
should I get how can I keep this quiet
how can I build my own speakers but not
speaker themselves but you know speaker
enclosures and what kind of wiring that
kind of stuff so it's all very hands-on
mechanical electrical and stuff it to be
honest you know that is that kind of
nitty-gritty work that that moved me
forward with it all mostly because I got
sick of it and I just wanted something
that worked which is the story of my
life when it comes to cars and houses
and computers you know the whole thing
is just you know spending so much time
with hand-me-downs and POS is and you
just finally want something that works
and so you know it took almost 10 years
but I finally went back to college for
computer sciences and and as in college
where everything kind of turned around
and certainly went mobile that's for
sure yeah for sure yeah I mean that it's
interesting that's interesting angle I
just realized like so you went back to
school you went you went to school
rather for for computer science so where
were you were you just looking to to
continue that gearhead mentality to just
sort of find the find the inner workings
and tinker with what was eventually
going to become ubiquitous in our lives
yes essentially I mean I'd worked the
string of jobs into the office jobs at
this point no more turning wrenches but
it's still at dealerships mind you so
I'm still in the automotive world but
yeah yeah pushing paper nonetheless and
using computers on a day-to-day basis
that was a big thing was using the
computers and it just came easy for me
as i'm sure it comes to to most people
especially these days yeah but you know
you're always when you become good or
you help one person with one issue on a
computer all of a sudden as you guys
know you become a guru and you're
helping everybody and that's that's kind
of why I went to school was you know I'm
already helping everybody let's go step
it up let's learn my skills you know
network technician you learn some server
side stuff that's what I started in and
that very very quickly jumped over to
the programming world and I still don't
know how to properly configure my home
router it should've stuck with that a
little bit longer here oh man any-any
like high tech person will be stifled
when you put a printer in front of them
and be like why doesn't this work
exactly print that Dean of existence
that reminds me of a story that I have
to share real quick that's ok go for it
Lou so ok this was probably i don't know
maybe 97 98 we had a printer that wasn't
working right on our computer wasn't
bonding and so we had my uncle who was
like you know he was a computer
programmer and you know super smart guy
and he came over and he did all these
massive trouble shooting things and
couldn't figure anything out I think it
might have been Christmas or something
cuz we had him over and we had my best
friend's dad over to which was he was in
the technology but not so like hardcore
like programmer type anyway so my uncle
couldn't figure it out for the world of
him he did all the ran all these
commands at all these diagnosis and then
mr. Doughty was his name he came down he
looked at the computer he moved to the
back he plugged it in and all was fine
the court had come undone so my you know
the techie one wanted to do all these
hardcore like analysis and running
scripts and figuring all these really
complicated things but all he did was
make sure that the court was in right it
was fixed sorry when he said printers
that reminded me of that did all no no
yeah I even have a story about that too
like I remember the first because I did
tech support yeah in college and I was
like okay so this used to be a big deal
back then but obviously you know or
older now and it doesn't really matter
but I was at the time the only freshman
in the school's history to ever be hired
as a tech support specialist because
quote unquote I was that good and the
first on-call assignment that I had was
at this I went to the University of San
Diego so young people always joke about
it it's a lot of privileged people there
especially the females they're like the
university of spoiled daughters is what
it used to be called and i would i went
to this one girl's dorm and she was
freaking out because her printer wasn't
working and there was a paper that was
all ready to do in like the first few
weeks of school and she was freaking the
heck out and i was trying to figure out
what's wrong with this printer it wasn't
really connecting it was registered on
the computer which i remember what's
going on and sure enough she had just
not plugged the damn thing into a
computer and i was like i thought these
were wireless like what if it doesn't
work wirelessly plug the damn thing and
and I remember it gave me an idea I
always wish that I did this and I wish I
could go back in time and then do
day if a problem like that was that dumb
if the solution was that stupid I always
wanted to have like a pocket of glitter
and when i plug it in yeah popular and
when some when someone calls me for that
kind of problem and i plug it in and it
works and they're all and you know
before i give them like the final oh
look it's working they're like oh did
you figure it out is it gonna be okay
I'm like yeah let me just do one thing
real quick and then it's grab the
glitter oh my on the printer or on the
computer and then hit the button and it
works like I wouldn't and I would never
explained why you should have done that
hey that's awesome like they called a
tech support sounds like I don't know
what he did we threw some glitter on it
is working oh my god all right before we
already move off the rails that that
what we went to school for if it had to
do with tag that's an interesting angle
because I went to school for
communication studies which technically
is what what I'm doing now being in the
new media obviously but I was curious
Joe what was your major in University
and can come video game development
actually i'll see ya like it it's crazy
how it permeates throughout yeah it's it
it's it is what i'm trying to either way
the Frasers I'm having a brain for sorry
guys it's midnight where I am right now
um but it it helped a lot when i started
doing blogging because even just a
couple of years in like I've never built
anything substantial in terms of video
games i have actually haven't even
played with playing or doing a video
game in a while but uh like when you get
you know that the first couple of years
into developing video games you start
losing a lot of respect for like sixty
percent of the games that are in the
google play store right now like
everyone's like check out this brand-new
its revolutionary little minimal puzzle
game with like two shapes I'm like dude
I can do that try again I'm not
reviewing this go away so did you hate
like super hexagon no super hexagon was
fun and really really hard but it was
you know it looking at it it's just a
bunch of you know shape
it's been in various patterns and you
know it's it's not difficult to make but
it's difficult to play and that's why I
like that one but like i looked at like
I was never ended like that the 2048
game I thought that game was stupid cuz
it's like uh somebody made a million
dollars off of as something that they
could have learned in six months like
he's just uh so it turned me into a snob
a little bit but the thing that sucked
was that uh all of the stuff that I was
learning was in like C++ and the the
game studio I was using was unreal at
the time known as this like I a bit huge
into android now and I can't use my c++
knowledge for squat it's totally useless
now that's like man why didn't I learn
Java that would have been a way better
idea I remember hearing though back in
the data Java was like the worst thing
to learn back then and now it's
everywhere it was yeah yeah okay mean it
was the exact same thing in my world but
school after I change program over to
the programming side I learned all the
dotnet stuff vb and asp so i can code
for windows but i mean i'm running all
linux and android now when I can't code
anything for myself either right it's so
frustrating it's like two years a wasted
life like man that's s tens of thousands
and student loans I'll never get back
damn it was it now like at all it's all
Python and Java nowadays right like
that's pretty much what everything is
your yeah okay we're gonna jump over to
grocery in a second but I wanted to make
sure we covered this with feisty when
did Android get into your tech life like
when did when did it sort of evolved
into basically what you're doing now
right from day one of Android before it
was even you know the first products
went out to the public and of course
that was when i was in college learning
this stuff but you know i was going
ripping down operating systems learning
what the colonel was all that kind of
stuff and and then Along Came Google
with this new fangled operating system
for mobile and I'm like hey look
professor can we look at this he's like
there's no future in mobile
yeah and who wants an automobile when
you have Zeppelin yeah so you know that
was kind of it was you know before I
really knew what Android was or what it
could ever be I was analyzing it you
know its internals its software stack
and how it used in tents to handle all
of its processes and and you know
passing off you know tasks and yeah I
fell in love with the OS how it was in
the back end before I'd ever seen an
image of what it looked like on a device
oh okay that's good and then of course
the rest is history reporting on that
now are you the crazy thing about like
where we come from in terms of tech is
like we we we were basically living
proof of where it's where it was and
we're complaining about the way it was
and now we're complaining about the way
it is now so not a whole lot of joy as I
true I self everything I think it's all
fantastic I loved my old crappy compact
that never works because there was a
game on it that I could never ever beat
and it was like this ms-dos game where
you had to hit the spacebar shot an
arrow to the right hand like time it
correctly and I was like nine years old
I can I mean I figured it out a couple
of times but I was never any good at it
I sound so familiar I can't think of
what I love the crap out of that it was
just called archery is like an MS
Dodgers just like play archery and then
this is a little targets would fall down
the right side you shot the arrow at it
I love that game I thought it was
awesome I had no idea that there were
better games out there at the time
hashtag bring back Archer this Oregon
Trail guys come on Oregon Tom an organ
trail to oregon trail through superior
sequels blow there's a second one hold
on what what there's like a million
organ trails but oregon trail to was the
best or become a nose a second one if
you died of dysentery
well it obviously wasn't a sequel of
events it was just a remake no I know
was that the second one because you had
to beat the first one first to play the
second yeah there was like Diwali and
they just did they just remake it from
mobile or something not too long ago I
think no yeah they did a um because I
remember someone asked me to review this
and I told them no uh it wasn't Oregon
Trail the game it was like Oregon Trail
the sequel like all right you have
settled the West and now you have to
build a farm and I was like oh as I held
to no no i don't i'm not building any
farms I'm sorry were talking about that
one called organ trail where no we're
not talking about Israel organ trail was
a fun as hell game that game was awesome
problematic as hell but fun alright well
let's just pop over to crush me then how
did this tech world become your world
well for me it started it started
shortly after the Christmas of 1990 mom
so specific yeah the stuff i'm a nerd
like that to see that was the year that
my sisters were begging for i had older
sisters I have no no brothers with just
me and two older sisters and eventually
one younger anyway and they were begging
for a gaming system and so that year
under the tree there was a NES um it was
the one that was bundled with the Mario
Brothers &amp;amp; duck hunt uh anyway the funny
thing about that is when they first set
it up downstairs in the family room I
absolutely hated the thing because
everyone kept using it that meant I
couldn't watch cartoons you know I was
five uh so I was really mad until one
day my dad gave me like this is probably
a few months after we got it so when you
know the next year uh my dad gave me a
chance to play mario for a little bit
and like that was it I was addicted
after that you know and I've been
addicted to I was a Nintendo fanboy for
pretty much forever um I'm still pretty
close to that but I've moved on um I
still have a place in my heart for
Nintendo but more the old Nintendo and
not so much the new one but anyway it
really started with video game systems
for me I was huge in the game systems I
collected
I owned a Game Boy of course like every
other child of that of my era you know
super nintendo and you know that's
pretty much where it got started um as
far as like my you know obviously that's
geek but it's not necessarily tech geek
where I made the shift was uh well a few
Christmases later 90 probably 95
December to Maya of course hey 5pm if no
it was 753 anyway so uh um my family
decided once again because my sisters
were begging for it got a computer um a
compaq presario um CD s something i
think was like a 924 anyway this thing
was ancient by today's standards i mean
it's it's archaic back then it was
awesome but seventy five megahertz
Pentium one um eight megabytes of RAM
and it didn't even have a gig hard drive
it was like seven hundred fifty
megabytes no oh yeah yeah a 14.4 k modem
oh my goodness yeah this thing was that
was classy oh my god I surprised we
haven't talked about 28.8 or 56k because
well maybe we just would all like to
forget that I guess yeah you know I
remember what I upgraded to a 56k modems
like this is fast the Internet oh yeah
what a great thing the internet you know
going from you know going from 14.4
anything sentiment um you know and then
so yeah it was old old computer Windows
3.1 out of the box and back in those
days they didn't force you to windows 95
was out but it was just out so they
didn't force you to you know have the
newest it came to the disks if you want
to install it later which I had to build
up enough tech knowledge before my
parents would let me do that so was like
two years later um but anyway um yeah I
got started with that computer and I
just fell in love and got into really
primitive programming languages like GW
basic
and qbasic a little later and that's
pretty much where I got started by by
about two three years in so I would have
been 11 or 12 I started building
computers um and then I started selling
them to friends and family and actually
that's something I continued to do for
my whole life even today I still do as a
side thing at now granted it's not
really something to do regularly anymore
but I still have some regular people
that will contact me for things and I'll
and I'll do it for pay and so yeah
basically started with computers for me
you know I've at windows I've used every
version of Windows I've built hackintosh
is I've built you know i have used for
too much various different versions of
linux over the years so okay well we'll
use the term mobile but obviously you
know where we have the android ankle
when did when did mobile sort of pop
into your tech life there well mobile
popped in quite early as far as like
smartphones and stuff um well even
before smartphones i owned you know I
owned a Palm Pilot I had a sony CLE a
you know i had all of those old palm
based stuff and then i moved into
windows mobile a little later with the
touch pro 2 and that was in like 2010 oh
wow um that was windows mobile 6
something i think ya banat tried too
hard to look like when you yeah what up
with it well I thought that was awesome
back then I you know I was like yes it's
like I'm have a computer you know the
hardest thing to troubleshoot as a yeah
though they were awful they were awful
and apps were off everything was awful
about them then I upgraded I don't know
if I would consider much of an upgrade
but it was Android at least I upgraded
to the LG vortex mm which most people
who are listen to this might know that
as the G optimus one um but on verizon
it was called the vortex so you're
talking us the 600 megahertz qualcomm
chip and Froy oh oh nice yeah and so
that was that was 2011 I think so and
that's so that was my 2011 swear I'll
started with Android for me
so and it was mostly budget stuff until
more recent like a couple you like it
was a few years ago that I finally
started getting decent android phones so
yeah baby when i started at android
authority of that too much before that
actually you know it was what I you know
cuz well I you know I did an authority
part-time for a while and you know I I
had android the whole time but yeah they
were I mean I had I was still rocking
you know gingerbread when you know ice
cream sandwich was the thing you know
yeah and then I finally upgraded and I
was so excited yeah but I bet that would
be an exciting ones to move from I mean
I mentioned Froyo gingerbread my
goodness you see it just seems like ages
ago that we even had those in existence
yeah well yeah and I mean there's just
such a I mean honestly guess there's
been major changes form ice cream
sandwich to like lollipop but they still
seem related it's like Froyo and all of
them seem like they're in a different
world you know like they don't even you
know they don't belong there not android
you know yeah all right well I guess all
I guess I'll I'll follow up and I keep
thinking about like where where I've
come from in terms of like you know how
much I love tagging where it all started
and it's gonna sound like I was catered
for what I do identity now but anyway so
it started off I have one older brother
no other siblings just my older brother
and we we we like you guys had to share
a lot and the the first computer that I
ever got was an apple like an early
early apple and everything will look to
monochromatic on it and I remember we
stuck with that computer long long long
but long after we should have because we
gotta remember us getting like a like an
up-to-date printer and I tried to I
tried to print out the marvel.com splash
page because I had like all of the
superheroes on it and it basically fried
the good it was just too much data for
it to put into this more up-to-date
brenner but we ended up going to a
compaq also and I'm realizing presario
is probably a special like fancy way of
saying POS but hey I loved my computer
thank you like that you know what the
compact was really great but what I
remember most about it was
we had windows 95 on a I think we moved
to 98 after a little while but what I
remember most about that compact was
that I'm try remember if it was best buy
or compusa but i want to say was compusa
they had this policy where if your
computer messed up you could bring it
back and if the guys behind the counter
couldn't fix it you just got a
replacement what and what the he was bad
yeah that was compusa that was compusa
I'm pretty sure those come which might
have been part of the reason what they
would ever business fair enough but yeah
I remember we we took advantage of that
thing so many times because I remember
trying to mess with the version of
windows we had I tried to change the
splash screen all the time the loading
screen with that little bar on the
bottom I remember changing it so that it
said like windows 98 pirate edition and
if I turn it up and the whole thing was
messed up then we moved to like HP and
now this was when the turning point came
because what used to be just like the
apple computer and you know the the one
that I fried because of the the Marvel
splash screen became a media center
computer by HP that was in my room and
that was when I I used to tell people
used to ask me all the time like how do
you know so much about technology and I
said when I was a kid I had a computer
in my room and all the time in the world
and that's pretty much what happened i
learned how i learned the ins and outs
of how to really make the windows
experience like my own and cater things
you know it was off was it just software
then or did you it was software like i
never got into building computers and
actually like a little while back i
remember time Joe that I wanted to move
to a desktop computer and I came to him
like like the absolute noob like please
teach me and oh that story gets better
because I put together a really nice
part list after fighting out his budget
and all that stuff and then like a day
later he messaged me back I'm just gonna
buy a laptop I know because I realized
you know as much as I would love having
a desktop there i was i was in the
market for a ps4 and i still needed a
rig that was portable then for the trade
shows and stuff so it it made sense as
much as it didn't so like that's why i
was i was fighting with it like I
you're putting together that part list I
was like I was so torn but between the
the possibilities but yeah I missed with
those computers a lot and of course
gaming had a lot to do with you know how
I was back then also I had a I had a ps2
around this particular time but I had
like I was mostly a gameboy player
before then Nintendo yes before then but
I was so young at that point that I
don't remember exactly what we played
all the time on the NES but yeah
PlayStation 2 was really where I found
my stride as a gamer too so much to the
point where i still have I could dig it
up somewhere I still have a spindle of
all the pirated games and I remember
getting like a label maker for it and I
would actually just recreate on paper
the the actual what the discs look like
and like stick it on basically I
basically was like a peddler for for
these uh for these games and and the
thing is I games a lot on the ps2 but
where were mobile let's say but also
where my love for actually seeing
technology where it was going and and
what kind of became what would become my
reporting life in technology came during
the PSP days because Sony back then they
were they could do no wrong they could
absolutely do no wrong they had the sony
ericsson line with the Walkman the w810
the W 800w 850 and and then the PSP came
out and everyone was all up on the PSP
and I got it I got both you know I was
able to swing it I got straight A's and
I was able to swing both um and I
remember my dad found t3 and an issue of
t3 which is a British magazine for tech
very trendy not necessarily like to
in-depth but they're pretty trendy
they're pretty popular out in Britain
and he looked on the page that said like
the top 10 gadgets of the year and sure
enough number one and two were the sony
ericsson phone and the PSP and i
remember it was at that point that some
sort of light clicked in my head like oh
I I know a thing or two about what the
people would want maybe I could make
maybe one day I would love to write
about technology and from there just
mobile started to sort of become a big
thing I went from the sony ericsson
phone i went to
my first smartphone was a blackberry
bold 9000 I I missed that thing so much
to be honest mostly because BBM was that
awesome back then it sucks ass now I
never got behind blackberry ola be fair
though i've never really used him that
much ever the keyboard answer did but
i'm just waiting for google to buy
blackberry because this the the patents
behind the keyboard and how it interacts
with with with the does the smart phone
capabilities that those are all still
blackberries camp and really they're the
only ones who can make a keyboard and
it's like the most sublime experience
ever but it was after that that I went
to the droid incredible and that was
when the whole Android life started to
come in I started routing and doing all
that stuff I don't do so much anymore
given how robust operating systems are
now but yeah I got into the whole
routing game I put cyanogen mod on my
droid incredible I got a Galaxy Nexus
which at the worst battery life and I
remember having spare batteries in my
bag all the time and always popping them
in and out and slowly but surely I
started to get you know more more and
more into this world of mobile and
android and here's the part that I
really wanted to share and was when it
came to video production obviously I'm
you know Joe and I are the are the
youtubers in this podcast right now but
like when it comes when it came to video
production and that's obviously the big
crux of what i do now associate entra
thority um I always remember back to all
like the the family vacations that we
had and we had you know these piece of
crap camcorders and at one point I had a
flip video and i would use those but i
remember i always became the historian
of our of our family vacations and i
remember when i first started out being
the video camera guide so we can
document our memories I would do shots
like this here and there I would narrate
in the
background Nicole check out this museum
that were at our old check out this
landmark my dad would always give me
tips it's not that he knew what all of
the what all of the terms were but he
would say stuff like no know when you're
going to move the camera like I just do
slowly because you want to see
everything blah blah blah and it just
kind of it blows my mind because all
those things that he said back then not
even knowing what he was saying kind of
became what I do for a living now it was
almost as if growing up he knew and when
you think about that aspect of my life
and video production and then getting
into mobile and then loving tech it
almost feels like I'm exactly where I
need to be so it's it's it's pretty
gnarly what I think about it and while
you guys were talking I was thinking
about I was like all holy crap like this
is going to be kind of a crazy story for
me to share so those were our origin
stories and sorry if i rambled on a
little bit there but I don't want good
we're coming up on oh thank you are way
better than mine I wasn't even a tech
nerd until eight years ago haha oh yeah
I didn't and I never got around to I
kind of spaced out the whole part about
how I transitioned into doing what I do
for a living oh well I mean it just kind
of felt I felt pertinent because of we
know the things I was thinking about oh
yeah but if you want to show that I mean
my all means go for it oh no it's it i
mean basically I uh I went to college
you guys were talking about that angle
uh I went to college for business
administration I was really into that
kind of stuff I mean I was well as in
college I was a manager at a really
young age of as a store manager for
McDonald's and I ended up becoming a
district manager when I finished and I
stayed with that for a while because
believe it or not fast food can put prey
can pay pretty well as you get up there
and I stayed for it for a while but you
know I got burnt out you know working 70
hours and something that was just a
thankless job you know and they always
expected more from you and if anyone did
anything wrong you were blamed for it
and eventually I I just got you know to
the point where it's like huh see as a
child I was there was two things I was
passionate about before that it was
technology and it was writing
I remember writing when I was like I
don't know probably 11 or 12 my version
of Jurassic Park to before Jurassic Park
to came out it was awful i'm sure but it
was I did write like a hundred pages you
know I was I've started and never
finished probably a hundred novels over
the course of like from third grade up
till a couple years ago when I finally
realized it was never going to finish it
he thinks oh it's time to give up but
anyway so you know I got to the point
where I was like you know I don't like
what I'm doing it's time to explore
other avenues it's for a little while I
took a job working in a factory just you
know warehouse type situation you know
driving around for cliffs and I started
exploring the internet for writing I
knew that people you know that it was a
possibility that I could find something
and I started just doing random like
freelance writing for just anything and
then one day a the site doesn't even
exist anymore but there was this little
tiny site called mobile magazine and I
ran into it and I decided to apply and
he gave me opportunity I knew nothing
about WordPress at the time and this is
like four years ago now and I was like
you know what I'll do this is a side
thing and see and it's it's like my all
my training it's kind of like what you
were saying that's why I decided to
mention it it's like everything I did
before found its home you know I I
helped you know run the administration
side there I you know I wrote it was I
got to express myself about technology
and what I came to android authority
just continued from there and now i'm
basically you know in an administrative
role and then I right and I edit and you
know what so it's like everything you
did before even though I may not I would
never have guessed in a million years
that would be doing what I do today um
it makes sense looking back though you
know yeah absolutely I don't know if Joe
and Phi see you wanted to sort of
explore that that that that aspect like
you know what what tech world or what
you've done in the past kind of like
shapes what you are doing right now um
you want to go first feisty sure I'll
dive in yeah did i mention that that
purchasing my first android phone was
almost an accident
so here's the thing 2007 which I meant
to buy an iPhone no they were sold out
no no I'll touch on that Len I promise
but uh no see us halfway through college
at this point I was rocking my HTC touch
the windows mobile phone you know you
know previous version to what the gresh
II had there but the same device and now
let me say you know google announced
what there was this morning or last
night that that they have this
cross-platform music app that you know
can work on the phone on them on the you
know the Chrome browser all this kind of
stuff that's the stuff I was doing in
school with this windows mobile phone I
would you know create games you know
dotnet programming on the laptop and
then just a few quick button pushes it
would pour it over to the phone but it
regardless so here I am 2010 I'm in the
midst of doing all the paperwork so I
can move from canada to the states I
don't want to buy a new phone I'm
driving through the mountains for coming
from British Columbia through back home
to Calgary and the phone dies just
completely stops so I find the next best
buy I pull in i say i want the cheapest
prepaid android phone you could give me
and I had it got the LG optimus one that
old p500 you know what it's right here
in front of me it still plays music just
fine on gingerbread yeah i think was
awful that possible gene haha bread was
like camera was like the the the top of
everyone being excited about an OS
release oh my god did you see the glow
at the end of the scroll holy balls that
was amazing I just love grush II just
stomping all over face tees memories
there like that no it's a bet that's the
fun I had that was my first android
phone so I'm just gonna be fun you know
I'm just yeah that is what it was it was
the same phone other than mine was
labeled LG vortex but it was exact same
okay got you so yeah just for my own
experiences that thing froze all the
time ya never had oh I've rooted this
one and I like that probably it was
verizon okay you know probably the fact
that i had verizon bloatware may have
played you know a role I'm just saying
that again this was the unlocked version
so that helped a little bit yeah um so
yeah I rocked that phone for the longest
time until finally I moved into the
states and then well i got the Moto G
but but you know that the defining point
for me moving to today it was the Nexus
7 I remember watching 2012 the i/o
conference sitting there in my office
watching it and I mold it over for a
couple weeks before i actually ordered
but i finally ordered that thing and
that they had arrived was you know
completely new experience for me yeah it
showed up what can I say I'll never
forget that day it was my brother wasn't
a motorcycle accident that day so I you
know I turned the device on I got the
phone call I was out the door you know
there's a three-hour drive up to where
he was I basically did the initial setup
of the Nexus 7 you know in the waiting
room in hospital my first week with that
device was our entertainment in the
hospital room it was in ever since then
I you know I I don't think I've gone a
day since that thing arrived that I
haven't touched a tablet and and you
know just that that kind of where it all
came from was there you know that device
became at the time it was the strongest
computer i had and it did everything
there wasn't much that I could not do on
it and I i was doing quite a bit on it i
might add but you know now there's
multiple devices and you know i
distribute everything across and you
know through this all out i was working
at a real estate company and I was kind
of doing their in-house technology stuff
and web development but really the big
thing that got me over to the writing
side was just writing all the in-house
how-to manuals I will say again for
anybody new computer users listening
double-click does not mean push the left
and right mouse buttons at the same time
is the left mouse button twice oh yeah I
just imagined myself doing that and that
feels really weird oh yeah yeah no
kidding yeah so yeah that was kind of
the world I was in was you know after
school but before working with you guys
here at Android authority was you know
working with the people at real estate
world sorry that wasn't the name in the
company in the real estate world just
teaching them how to use technology in
general you know starting right from the
ground up and that well as you have seen
you know plugging again my Thursday
posts even today was you know just a
basic simple easy user stuff with you
know how to change an icon pack on your
on your device nice and you know I'm
getting a lot of love and air quotes
from readers who are like me come on
that's simple stuff why are you doing
this button you know I've answered this
question for a number people before it
was you know requested again that I
write it up here so you know what I was
doing before is it's at least one small
part of what I'm doing now and then well
writing other than that is certainly
still learning process for me what is
speaking to the quote unquote love as
you said I remember mentioning this to
someone at mwc the people who will
benefit most from what seems like the
simple stuff are the exact same people
who probably don't even know how to
comment on it okay so there you go I'm
yeah you you you probably reached a lot
of people who have who have benefited
from the work that you've done you just
don't know it because well you know
chances are maybe they actually don't
know how to tell you that they did that
that thank you that you're looking at
you're looking for possibly you know
absolutely ah sound of this disqus yeah
what the hell is disqus not exactly
so Joey formulated your thoughts there
are you gonna bring yeah I went over
this up briefly in my meet the team
video so i won't go into too much too
much detail so i got like the moto cliq
and but i didn't root my first device
until the HTC mytouch 3g slide and holy
crap i hate saying the name of that
phone every time i do i just like it's
like six syllables it's ridiculous but I
rooted that and that was the first time
I did a whole lot of stuff and it was
you know going from because I still
wasn't that much of a tech nerd back
then like I loved technology but I
wasn't like a nerd about it um the HTC
mytouch 3g slide was the first time I
nerded out on something like I was in
the XDA forums i was looking up how to
tether and I you know I looked up how to
route the thing i routed the thing
learned how to flash the custom roms
learned what cyanogenmod was and it was
like it was such a huge and overwhelming
experience I was like man I'm never
going to get all this um my next phone
after that was the HTC g2 which is my
first 4g phone cuz well 3.5 g for the
haters out there hspa+ rocks I don't
care what anyone says I know but you
know I rude at that put cyanogen mod on
that and then after that I decided to
dump t-mobile because at the time they
sucked and I picked up the evo 4g the
HTC evo 4g on sprint and thats was the
phone that made me an android fan the
kind of android fan that I am today a
phone was ridiculous it was the route
methods there was the S off methods
there were like something like two or
three hundred roms AOSP and stock sense
and it went from two point two two two
point three to four point oh and it was
like you know before 2.3 was even out
there were four point 0 sense roms out
it was ridiculous and you know I started
hanging out in IRC channels and I sort
of talked into the moderators and to the
developers you know not like you know
you know talking with them but like kind
of just sitting there and watching them
talk for anybody listening that
remembers the the last Android a thought
podcast the the hangouts on air one
Daniel Charlton is how I met him he yeah
he was a kernel developer he developed
kernels for the evo 4g he went by Tiamat
back then I think um so yeah the first
time I met him he actually a band me
from the IRC channel for three days
because I said something stupid um but I
learned so much about Android with the
evo 4g and frankly you know speaking
that the root experience for every phone
since then has been wildly worse like
the 4g was just so epic in every
conceivable way um and then I had an EVO
3d and a galaxy s2 and then a Galaxy
Nexus and then an HTC evo 4g LTE after
that um during that time I was I was in
college was doing full time college I
was you know I was working various small
jobs I was a rookie a uhaul at some
point I worked in a BW three wild wings
and it was october i think was 2012 and
unfortunately my dad passed away and i
was living at home with him you know he
was the one that was paying the bills
putting the food on the table you know
roof over the head while i went to
college and after he passed away I
suddenly had this problem where oh
I need a roof over my head so I was
looking for a second job and I was
looking everywhere for one and i was
just goofin out on XDA one night is like
two o'clock in the morning and I saw
Help Wanted writers I was like well
he'll why not and uh so I sent them a
message I was like hey you know I don't
really write much but I really love you
know the forums and I've been here for
years and at that point I was pulling
like modems out of phones and posting
them up in posting stock roms and all
that stuff you know like little modder
stuff but definitely more than most and
uh they hired me on and then I worked in
XDA for a 14 months and then
transitioned over to android authority
but uh in terms of writing I was
actually in the military for four years
in my early 20s
and my first the first unit I was ever
in was disbanded or disbanded shut down
or whatever it wasn't needed anymore so
I got transitioned over to a PR units
and ended up transition transitioning
into broadcast journalism and that's
where I kind of like anybody who watches
my video delivery that's where I learned
it then the super rapid-fire fast you
know if I screw up I have to start over
and do it again that's where I got that
from oh I see so I mean it's crazy like
thinking about it now we we came into
this podcast thinking oh we're just
gonna talk about the stuff we used to do
and now we realize just how much it kind
of melded us into who we are now I
didn't I was not planning on this
podcast being so cathartic and that it
did all the fields yeah I know right
we're all just like is the origin
stories our Chin's are in our hands
right now we're just like you're the
thing that sucks is like I cuz I have a
keyboard tray and then like my mic
doesn't fit on it so I'm actually like
straight back leaning forward a little
bit I don't have any room to rest my
elbows anywhere so and you guys may be
doing that the you know the hands and
the chin kind of thing but I'm like
straight-up wired ready to go right now
like all right well it is it is well
past midnight for Joe though so I mean
we're a little bit past our time but I
you know what we've had such a good time
sharing and listening to one another
story is that you know I hope I hope all
of you have been able to get something
out of this particular podcast and this
is certainly another one of those
favorites that we've had I think we can
all agree but yeah i'll go ahead and I I
was telling them at the beginning of the

canned intros during the call but I will
still do the canned outros oh man died
