this video there's actually a very high
chance that you just watched the Samsung
Galaxy unpacked event here in San
Francisco California that is where we
just came from and Samsung just unveiled
not one not two not three but four new
phones so we're gonna go through all
those new phones today we got these
Samsung Galaxy S 10 samsung galaxy s 10
plus samsung galaxy s 10 e and the
samsung galaxy s 10 5g so first off
let's start off with these samsung
galaxy s 10 and the samsung galaxy s 10
plus and these are definitely the
flagships that the company is releasing
right now they've got these big
beautiful displays they're definitely
upgrades from the simpson galaxy s 9
you've got a 6.1 inch OLED display on
the samsung galaxy s 10 and a 6.4 inch
OLED on the samsung galaxy s 10 plus is
what they've done is done this new
hole-punch display which they're calling
infinity oh so in the samsung galaxy s
10 you're just getting a little hole
punched out of the top right of the
display where they're putting the camera
whereas on the samsung galaxy s 10 plus
you get kind of like an oblong shape
because you've actually got two cameras
in this whole cut so both the samsung
galaxy s 10 and the s 10 plus you've got
a 10 megapixel camera which is used for
selfies but of course in the s 10 plus
you've got an additional 8 megapixel
camera which is mostly used for depth
detection so you can actually get a
really good portrait selfie as for the
other cameras you've actually got three
cameras on the S 10 and s 10 plus you're
getting a 16 megapixel ultra wide camera
a 12 megapixel standard camera which
they call wide and a 12 megapixel
telephoto camera so you can really get
that ultra wide image you want to look
for you can get a standard image or you
can use the telephoto lens if you're
looking for more of a portrait mode so
these are Samsung's flagship switch
means of course they're going to be
using the latest Snapdragon chip they're
writing the Qualcomm Snapdragon 805
they're running eight gigabytes of RAM
and they start at 128 gigabytes of
storage with expandable storage
available if you want that now you can
go up to 512 gigabytes of storage but
actually the s10 plus has an
option which is a ceramic option which
does 512 megabytes of storage or a one
terabyte option if you really want a ton
of storage in your phone now both of
these phones still retain the wireless
charging that we've seen in most Samsung
phones before this but they also have
reverse wireless charging so we first
saw this in the huawei mate 20 pro it
was a little bit slow but now Samsung is
finally kept playing catch-up they've
just added this in their phones and
we're hoping it's gonna be a little bit
faster because it works with phones or
it can actually work with the Galaxy
buds which they've also released
alongside these phones the other major
feature finally making its way to
Samsung's phones that we've seen in some
other manufacturers especially Chinese
manufacturers lately is an in display
from your front reader but this is not a
optical fingerprint reader like we've
seen in v1 plus 60 this is actually an
ultrasonic fingerprint reader which
means it actually vibrates the display
to read your fingerprint and this is
Samsung's flagship so you're getting
pretty much every feature that you could
find in a phone here you're getting ip68
water assistance you are getting a
headphone jack which is amazing I really
hope to ever attain that as another few
generations and you're getting cat 20
LTE which is a new LTE bands that is
super fast and you should get really
really good speeds on this phone so next
we got to talk about the samsung galaxy
s 10 e which is basically their reaction
to the iphone 10 r it's the cheaper
model that most people might actually
pick up it does look a little bit
cheaper to me it kind of looks like a
samsung galaxy s3 but it's just a new
version of that boats interesting is
you're getting almost everything that
you're getting in the samsung galaxy s
10 and has 10 plus you're just missing a
couple of features so you're still
getting the sanitarian 855 you are
starting at 6 gigabytes of ram instead
of 8 gigabytes of ram but you're still
getting the same amount when t 8
gigabytes of storage here now the other
key differences are that the back of the
phone also does not get that telephoto
lens you're just getting a standard and
a wide lens and instead of in ultrasonic
for your print reader you're actually
getting a capacitive fingerprint reader
besides that the screen is fhd instead
of quad HD but if you want a smaller
phone this is a 5.7 inch display and
this could actually be a nicer pickup
for some people that don't want that
huge display that you're getting on the
s10 in the s10 plus and finally they
also revealed at the galaxy s 10 5g and
this one isn't coming out right now it's
actually coming out in q2 of this year
but the major differences here is
got a bigger display six point seven
inches that's actually enormous but it's
also got 5g of course and then it's got
time-of-flight sensors on both the front
cameras and the back cameras in addition
to those three cameras on the back in
the two on the front this is very
similar to the s10 plus but you can do a
little bit better depth sensing and it's
more of like a 3d camera so if you want
to get your hands on these phones Peters
start tomorrow February 21st but they
actually come out on March 19th which is
a little bit of a way so just take that
as you will the 5g model of this phone
comes out in q2 we don't know a date we
don't know if rice we don't know if you
want it you probably are not gonna want
it yet because 5g is still gonna take a
little bit of time to get here it will
be getting there this year so if you
want to be on the cutting edge that
could be a cool option but otherwise I'd
probably just stick with one of these
normal phones so that's been it there
were a lot of phones to go through here
obviously we've had four phones
basically to talk about but we also have
a ton of coverage of basically
everything else the Samsung announced
today I have unpacked we've got the
Galaxy buds like all of those other
accessories but ton of photos so make
sure you stay tuned to hundred or thirty
calm for comparisons for whatever
Samsung news you might want so I will
catch you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
