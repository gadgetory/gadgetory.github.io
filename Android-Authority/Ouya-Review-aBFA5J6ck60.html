game console for the future or just a
phone with no screen find out in our
review hey everybody I'm Chris look when
the Ouya first had its funding goal on
Kickstarter a lot of people were excited
and a lot of people just didn't care
that still seems to be the case when you
talk to people about the oh yeah the
question is is it worth it for you well
that depends on what you're looking for
to see what I mean let's get started
with the review
well you might expect top-of-the-line
specs in a unit ostensibly dedicated to
gaming that's not what you get with the
Ouya though the specs aren't
particularly wimpy either powered by a
Tegra 3 chipset it runs a 1.7 gigahertz
quad-core CPU and ULP GPU along with one
gig of ram and 8 gigs of internal
storage for connectivity it has a tow
2.11 B G and n Wi-Fi wired Ethernet and
Bluetooth le 4.0 more on that later it's
got one standard USB slaw and one micro
USB slot and video output is through
HDMI current-gen high-end phones blow
those specks away but keep in mind that
this box only costs 99 bucks right now
the console itself is fairly small
essentially a 3 inch cube though a bit
stylized setup is super simple plug in
the AC adapter plug in an HDMI cable and
you're all set if you've ever used an
Xbox 360 controller the Ouya controller
should look and feel very familiar it's
not quite as smooth an its general feel
and obviously the buttons are labeled
differently in an entirely unsurprising
twist instead of the traditional letters
like you might expect to see on a
console controller you've got the
letters o
u Y and a guess what that spells where
the controller gets different is its
built-in touchpad this isn't clearly
marked on the controller and at first I
honestly had no idea was there but it's
a very cool feature especially when
you're using an app instead of gaming on
either side of the controller there's a
removable faceplate with a double a
battery underneath each I've heard
stories of these becoming loose but
during my time with the console I never
noticed this it is a little weird taking
off too
different base plates to change the
batteries but it's not a huge deal it's
worth noting that you can also use a ps3
controller via bluetooth or a wired Xbox
360 controller via USB the Ouya runs
Android 4.1 jellybean but you probably
won't ever notice unless you go look
under the hood the interface is entirely
leo with no trace of Android aside from
the occasional progress dialog or pop up
once the Ouya is turned on you're met
with a screen offering four options play
is a simple list of all the games you
have installed discover is where you go
to browse all the games and apps
available on the Ouya make is mainly for
developers although it's also useful for
those who want to sideload apps as
there's no Play Store here finally
manage is where you change console
options check for updates and generally
well manage things the who uses a try
before you buy model so any game you see
can be downloaded and played for free
what you get to play from the game and
how long you get to play it is entirely
up to the developer some games are short
demos or just demos of a single mode in
a game while others basically give you
the entire game for free and ask for
donations there are some cool games
available but the selection is the area
I think that is lacking the most right
now for every interesting game there are
10 games that are either straight ports
of simple Android games or are just
plain bad the one thing that we Ennead
x' most is a killer app one game that by
itself makes the system worth buying in
addition to games there are a few
rudimentary media box features for a
long time the only streaming at the Ouya
had was twitch TV a service for gaming
streams recently though it got support
for Plex which greatly increases its use
as a media box now the one thing that
will definitely make the system worth
buying for a lot of people exists in a
legal gray area emulators there are a
ton of emulators available right in lieu
you store everything from the original
NES to the PlayStation 2 odd systems
like the MSX are available these aren't
illegal by themselves but chances are a
lot of the roms you might use with them
are still I'm sure this will sell more
than a few units right now the main
thing that the RIA delivers is potential
well that and a lot of emulators it's
definitely a neat little device and for
99 bucks it's not quite an impulse buy
but it's close if you're looking for
really compelling games they're not
quite there yet anyway
luckily the try before you buy model
keeps you from buying a game you end up
hating the main thing is if Netflix and
other similar apps come to the system
and a couple great games then it'll
really be worth it we've got a written
