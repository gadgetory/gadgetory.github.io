to you by HipChat plus so were you
curious about what's in store for the
HTC One and nine otherwise codename des
kima what's gonna be powering that puppy
well I'm gonna give you my thumbs up on
those rumors thumbs down or just uh here
we go so first up let's start off with
the overall design given how the one
evolved from the m7 and m8 we imagine
the next-gen flagship will retain a
similar look and feel when compared to
its predecessors though we expect there
to be at least some minor refinements to
the HTC's design language there have
been some whispers that HTC will improve
the build quality by switching to a
tougher aluminium alloy when compared to
the m7 and m8 but really there's few
concrete details about how it will
actually differ the device is also said
to be launching in grey silver gold or
gunmetal gold color choices if well
known leaker up leaks proves correct we
can tell you that the size of the phone
will be quite similar to the HTC m8 one
set of images that were recently leaked
appear to show a device with very thin
lateral screen bezels but the same large
bezels at the top and the bottom with
the HTC logo now it's possible that
these images just show a prototype we'll
have to wait and see one interesting
feature is the large camera module on
the back but it remains to be seen
whether this will make it to the final
design or not now it should be noted
that Bloomberg has reported that the
overall design of the Hema will be very
similar to the m8 and hey if it's not
broken don't fix it so we're gonna give
this one a probable thumbs-up now let's
move on to the display and it looks like
that HTC is not gonna follow the herd
and make a bigger screen phone some of
the early rumors associated with the HTC
One m9 claimed that the phone will have
a much larger 5.5 inch display but the
more recent rumors have suggested that
there will be a more modest 5-inch 1080p
display while not as impressive as the q
HD resolutions that have been adopted by
other flagship phones we feel that this
will be an excellent resolution for a
5-inch display
phone now maybe I'm biased because I
want smaller one-handed devices but I'm
gonna give this a hopeful thumbs up to
now let's get to the guts and talk about
specs shall we now many sources have
gone back and forth with conflicting
rumors suggesting that the HTC m9 will
only have an 805 chipset others have
claimed that it will have the Snapdragon
810 with three gigabytes of RAM but
considering the fact that the LG G flex
2 is launching with this chips at the
a10 we can't say we'd be too surprised
battery life is also expected to make a
minor jump upwards going from 2600
milliamp hour battery to a 28 40
milliamp hour battery always as expected
the battery will be non-removable
I also think you're probable that HTC
will offer some sort of fingerprint
scanner so we're gonna give both the
fingerprint scanner and the 810
Snapdragon chipset I probable thumbs-up
now next up is the camera and this is a
big one for many of us HTC One has come
under a lot of flack for its ultra pixel
camera but this time our own HTC is
apparently switching things up
reportedly the phone will offer a twenty
point seven megapixel rear facing camera
though the exact size of the sensor is
not known just yet on the front reports
say that there will either be a 13
megapixel shooter or a four megapixel
ultrapixel camera with the former being
similar to the desire I set up and the
latter akin to the new desire 826 now
for one of the things the HTC One is
known for the most those front-facing
speakers what's in store one thing HTC
is known for is its sound quality and we
don't expect these things to change with
the one and nine in the past Beats has
power the sound tech behind the 1-series
but according to at least a few early
reports HTC may be teaming up with Bose
this time around the device tis said to
feature a Dolby 5.1 surround technology
integration well call it a gut feeling
but the idea of bose taking over from
beats so are you a fan of blinkfeed
let's talk software features not a lot
of rumors have focused on exactly what
would be different when it comes to
software improvements but you can expect
it to run Android 5.0 lollipop with HTC
Sense 7 on top one report meant
and advanced location services without
providing any other details
now given that HTC is expected to
release a SmartWatch along with the m9
Hema it's likely that there will be some
basic customization to take advantage of
a new wearable device and for that I got
to give a very probable thumbs up so
let's talk about when exactly you can
get your hands on this puppy this week
HTC sent out invites for a press event
taking place in Barcelona on March 1st
the day before the official opening of
the Mobile World Congress while the m9
keema wasn't mentioned or hinted at
specifically we're positive we will get
to see it then alongside a wearable
companion as for the actual availability
date if all goes well HTC will make this
new flagship available within a few
weeks after its official introduction so
some of you guys seem pretty surprised
than when I told you last week that the
whole Android Authority team is more
than like 22 people and none of us work
in person we all work remotely how do we
pump out so many videos and so many
articles every day and never see each
other face to face well we are in need
of some serious collaboration tools and
that's why I love me some hip chat plus
HipChat plus is an instant messenger
video Chad document sharing screen
sharing code sharing all integrated into
one simple platform and the best part is
that hip chat plus integrates with the
top developer tools like github JIRA
