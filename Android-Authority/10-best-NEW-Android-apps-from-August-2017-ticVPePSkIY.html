handy the Android authority app guy and
we're nearing the end of August and that
means it's time to find out the best new
Android apps that were released over the
course of the last month if you want to
check out any of these apps for yourself
you can find those links in the video
description below
adapte cons is essentially the
application version of Android O's
adaptable icons you can take virtually
any icon on your device and alter it to
fit your theme it even has support for
third-party icon packs with the only
caveat being that you need a launcher
that supports custom icons otherwise
this is a pretty decent little theming
tool and you'll get most of the features
in the free version the paid version
unlocks the rest of the features amazing
weather HD is a new live wallpaper and
it shows the current weather on your
home screen the application allows you
to view weather in multiple locations as
well
you can also lightly customize the
wallpaper and it should change whenever
the weather changes and also when it
turns from day to night and back again
you have to pay up front to use the
application thus we recommend you give
it a proper test before the refund time
expires
bolla is a new budget manager app it's
also rather simple you track your
paychecks expenses and your budgets you
already know and understand the goal of
budget apps so I'll keep that part short
it also supports multiple currencies
cloud syncing and you can keep track of
multiple budgets at once you won't find
a bunch of bells and whistles with this
one it handles the basics well enough
though those who need more hardcore
expense reports for things like taxes
probably won't need to use this one
you do get some features with the free
version and the full version runs for
three dollars and 49 cents d amplify
helps you deal with Google's amp pages
some people don't like them and this app
is for those people it allows you to
bypass amp links and other apps like
Twitter Facebook hangouts or even Google
assistant the only place it doesn't work
is Google Chrome and there isn't a
workaround for that it does its job
fairly well the free version gives you
the basic functionality while the paid
version lets you whitelist sites allows
for additional customization removes ads
and also has Tasker add-ons heree is a
new Android widget that creates
countdown timers you can use it for
things like birthdays special events or
even your favorite TV shows it also
includes recurring countdowns
notification settings and a lot more the
widgets are generally tasteful and they
shouldn't clash too hard with any given
theme you can also add images for a bit
of extra Flair the app is currently free
to download and use auto po is a photo
editor application that's still in beta
it focuses a lot on things such as
stickers frames filters and the like you
won't find many hardcore photo editing
features with this one on the plus side
it does feature a whole ton of filters
stickers and of course frames you'll be
able to crop and rotate images add
elements and then move those elements
around it is a beta app and that means
there will be bugs but it is free with
no in-app purchases flex chat is a new
chat application for gamers it competes
with the likes of discord Skype and
other types of gamer chats you create a
hub for your gamer group or guild or
whatever game you happen to be playing
it features 10 levels of permissions
various chats within the group and a lot
more it should scale well depending on
the size of your group or your game it
is still a little slow and rough around
the edges you might not want to try it
out just yet however do keep it on your
radar because it could be really good
someday Samsung doesn't typically
release applications for non Samsung
devices Samsung internet browser happens
to be one of those few rarities this is
a fairly lightweight browser it features
extensions material design at swiping
tabs a night mode and a lot more the
extensions include ad blockers many of
them aren't compatible with most phones
just yet however one or two should be
available for most people it's in beta
and that means it's buggy and a little
bit slow it has a lot of potential
though style music is a new radio app
and it's also a regular music app yes it
does both the music player part of it is
basic but effective you can listen to
your library get meta data downloads
from last.fm and a lot more there is
also a full review for those who like
that the radio part contains over 50,000
stations for you to listen to frankly
this is one of the better radio music
players that can do both of these things
it is just a little bit buggy though
wall r is a new wallpaper app it has a
massive collection of over 100,000 HD
wallpapers it can also auto set your
wallpaper turn wallpapers into low poly
crystallized images and a lot more the
free version of the application doesn't
have hardly any feature
you'll have to pay the price of
admission in order to really play with
this one additionally those who love
crispy super high-resolution images may
be a bit disappointed with the 1080p
stuff here it is free to download though
and there are tons of options and that
about does it for this one folks don't
forget to subscribe to Android Authority
and ring the bell to get the latest
android authority videos as soon as they
come out once again all of these links
are in the video description below if
you want to check out any of these apps
for yourself as always thanks for
watching everybody and have a wonderful
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
