we had good stuff on not only the s8 but
foldable devices and a smart jacket so
why is it that uncle Sammy decided to
put the fingerprint sensor on the
Samsung Galaxy s8 on the back in that
awkward position right beside the camera
well it turns out that they wanted to
put it on the front screen but they ran
out of time the decision to switch to a
rear-mounted sensor was reportedly made
at a last minute which would explain the
somehow awkward design if it wasn't for
lack of trying the report says that
Samsung poured resources into synaptics
and made all-out efforts to finish it in
time but Samsung is trying to make time
for foldable devices will that be a
gimmick or a practical according to E t
news Samsung's long anticipated foldable
smartphone is finally getting close to
production the Korean company plans to
position this new form factor at the top
of its production line above current
flagships unnamed industry sources told
ichi news that samsung electronics and
samsung Display aim to start prototype
production in the third quarter of this
year several thousand units will be made
and seated to major partners including
carriers the goal is to gather feedback
and further test the foldable smartphone
design ahead of mass production it seems
kind of gimmicky to me I guess it
depends on the actual design but hey I'm
the guy who thought that big phablets
were only for power users and geeks now
let's talk levi's commuter trucker
jacket I don't know why they call it
that
it's basically a smart jacket at Google
i/o last year the innovative Levi's
commuter trucker jacket was officially
announced made in partnership between
Levi's and Google's a top division the
product was scheduled to hit the market
this spring the good news if you want to
call it that is that we know the price
of this jacket it's not cheap it will
set you back 350 bucks the other news is
that you'll have to wait a little longer
before you can buy it the jacket is
scheduled to go on sale sometime this
fall what makes it unique is that it
uses conductive fabric to transform
clothes into connected devices it's very
simple to use all you have to do is tap
the sleeve of the jacket in order to
activate certain functionalities of your
smartphone play music answer calls use
Google Maps etc
now some of you may be thinking that's
kind of just a button on the sleeve no
big deal but it's the beginning of
something that has a lot of potential
for medical and security reasons just as
a parent imagine that if you're in a
mall or a Disneyland theme park or
something like that and you lose your
kid which happens almost every day that
shirt or jacket can begin to flash and
make sounds and alert everyone else
around them that hey this kid is lost
and needs to find their parent and of
course it's connected to your own shirt
and can help you you know play hot and
cold game where the closer you are
together it changes a certain color when
you're farther away it changes color
it's an easy way to make things more
secure like that you could also transfer
health information to an ambulance
driver that's picking you up there's
countless applications for law
enforcement medicine the whole shoot
shebang what do you think what are the
possibilities of smart fabric let me
know in the comments below now if you
