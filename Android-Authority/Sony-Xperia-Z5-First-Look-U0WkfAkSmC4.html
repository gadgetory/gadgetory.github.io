new flagship in their experience Joshua
car from Android authority what's going
on everybody and this is a first look at
the Sony Xperia z5 at first glance at
the Xperia z5 it might look a lot like
all the other experience but that's
something we probably expected already
in the Xperia z5 however there are a few
new features on here that should sweeten
the pot a little bit and hopefully this
phone is going to make it to many more
audiences aside from just the European
and Asian markets a 5.2 inch 1080p
display is available here and yes there
is a z5 premium that we're going to talk
about a little bit later but for now
we're going to take a look at the main
z5 that's powered by the Snapdragon 810
with three gigabytes of RAM 32 gigabytes
of storage with a micro SD card slot as
you can see here and this entire body is
water and dust resistant but what we do
really like about the z5 here is the
somewhat different look on the side what
we have here is a much larger silver
power button that doesn't quite look as
iconic as it did before as we remember
from previous experiences but still has
a very unique look but the reason why
it's a lot wider now is because Sony's
fingerprint reader is embedded in there
so if you're going to be unlocking the
phone with your right hand holding the
thumb there is going to be how you will
unlock the phone and it actually feels
quite nice just tap the button in order
to wake the phone and hold your thumb
there and it will unlock quite easily
feasibly you should be able to do this
with let's say your index finger on your
left hand for example but really in our
testing right here I went ahead and put
a fingerprint on there and it seemed to
really work quite well in general
however the experience d5 feels really
nice in the hand as most experience do
because it's symmetrical design just
feels quite solid and is really easy to
grip and really just sort of tumble
around if you need to get to the
notification drop-down at the top for
example or go from left to right the
Xperia z5 still continues that great
handling experience especially in the
size that it keeps at 5.2 inches in the
display now the display technology is
still being boasted about by Sony and we
do think that it looks quite nice
especially in our first look here but
really what we really notice here is
just how fast the phone is the
Snapdragon 810 is doing
great job of powering the Xperia UI
which is backed by android 5.1.1 and as
I'm going through the recent apps screen
and really hitting all the apps that I
possibly can it really feels like one of
the snappiest editions of Android that
we've seen thus far it's definitely up
there and the Xperia U eye does try to
keep things fairly Spartan with only a
few features here and there including
those little small apps that you can
access from the recent apps screen but
even then it still feels really really
smooth and very rapid but what we're
really excited for is checking out the
new camera now this is the first time in
the Xperia line in a long time that
we've had a reimagined camera module in
the back and we're really looking
forward to putting this 23 megapixel
Exmor RS sensor to its testing what
really is intriguing to us is the fact
that Sony really put out there that
their imaging department has been one of
the best and yes they have come up with
some great alpha cameras and hopefully
now we'll be able to see that kind of
quality in their smartphones the z5 also
sports one of the fastest autofocuses
and I tried to test it in this
particular unit and it did seem to do a
really good job even in this somewhat
low-light situation that I was testing
it out in of course 4k video capture
will be available on there and a steady
shot technology will hopefully be able
to stabilize all of the photos and even
the videos in a way that makes it very
pleasant to the eye the front-facing
camera is of a 5 megapixel construction
but really when you're looking through
the camera app it's tough there's so
many options and this is something we've
been used to from Sony for a long time
now everything from AR to even all of
these different ways of just
manipulating the shot panorama modes
slow motion fast capture and everything
that you could really hope for inside of
the camera to make your photography just
that fun but really we can't wait to see
if the quality of this phone is up to
snuff compared to all the other great
flagship Quogue that we've seen in 2015
already and finally we are going to take
a look at the Xperia z5 premium now we
do have a meeting with Sony coming up in
a day or two where we're going to get a
closer look at it because at the actual
press event no one was actually able to
get their hands on the premium we've
been told that we'll be able to tomorrow
now the z5 premium does have a 4k
display which is kind of insane when you
say it out loud but at a 5.5 inch
display you have
and one pixels per inch just a number
that we saw on their display there and
they were really touting it up being one
of the best displays that has been put
out especially with the highest
resolution that we've seen on a
smartphone to date but what they're also
going to do as Sony does with their
televisions and this is an intriguing
thought is the phone itself is going to
upscale all of the media content so that
it actually has a 4k look to it now we
are a little bit skeptical about that
even though a lot of media out there is
still around 720p resolution 1080p when
you're lucky it will get up scaled and
might have a different type of look to
it as a result but again we're really
excited to get our hands on and actually
compare these displays once we have our
hands on a review unit and if you're
thinking about battery life for a 4k
display the 2900 milliamp hour battery
of the original z5 gets a bumped up to
thirty four thirty in the z5 premium and
hopefully that's going to be enough to
put this phone through its paces across
the day whether it be for work and play
but with the stamina modes and the great
battery consumption options that you
have on the Xperia line you should be
able to get this phone so kind of
stretch itself out for quite a long time
but until we get our hands on a review
unit we're going to be waiting with
bated breath to get the Xperia z5 in our
hands and really put that camera at
least through its paces we do really
like the fingerprint reader in the side
power button and really it just looks
like a pretty solid phone that we had a
pretty good time with in our short time
with it already so keep it tuned to
Android Authority for even more from
Aoife in Berlin as we are here at the
Sony booth bringing you the Xperia z5
stay tuned for more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
