brought to you by the LG g3 so we've
been taking a pretty extensive look at
the LG g3 as of late and as you can see
here it is on my table we already have
extensive videos on the camera the
front-facing camera and even the NOC
code capability of this phone but I
wanted to just go ahead and bring you a
look at ten tips and tricks that you can
do with your LG g3 when you get it
whether it's on any of the carriers here
in the United States or beyond
so here we go we're just going to jump
right into the list now if you're not
going to be using the NOC code feature
which allows you to create a NOC code a
code of tabs onto the screen even when
it is in the standby position to unlock
and wake the device you can at least use
the knock-on now I have set it up right
now so that I have a swipe a classic
swipe unlock but if I want to just wake
the phone I would double tap on the
screen and there it is we have the
simple swipe to unlock right there but
if I wanted to also turn off or rather
put the phone in standby turn off the
screen
I could double tap on any blank area of
my actual home screen and it will also
turn off the phone it's a very easy way
of turning on and off your device after
that we're going to take a look at some
shortcut buttons these are really great
ways of waking the phone to two specific
functions the first one that I'll show
you is using the volume up button and
then after that is the volume down
button now the volume up button brings
you straight to a quick memo capability
that will allow you to very quickly
create a note so if anything happens in
your daily life that you really want to
be able to record you can go ahead and
just create that right here but the one
that I know a lot of you are probably
going to be using a lot is holding the
volume down button if you hold the
volume down button you will go straight
to the camera which is an easy way of
getting to a camera you can see me right
there hello
well and you can easily just get a shot
off very quickly in no time at all all
right and then after that we'll just go
ahead and jump into the next one now
we do have navigation bar buttons on the
bottom these are soft keys for the
operating system in the LG g3 but those
can be customized and especially with
the larger screen like this there's one
particular function that I love when it
comes to these home touch buttons that
are available on the bottom
but the button combination is where you
want to change things for example you
have four options right here
notifications quick memo qslide and dual
window the notifications one is the one
that I like that you can add to the
bottom bar which will allow you to not
have to swipe all the way down from the
top which usually take some hand
gymnastics but instead just hit the
button right there to be able to look at
your notifications top speaking of the
notifications we have all the quick
settings right here
and you'll notice that in the operating
system of the LG g3 it has been updated
to hide some of the elements that would
otherwise take up a lot of room inside
of your notification shade one way that
they did that was by opening the Q slide
like this and it will come out for
opening Q slide apps if you have the
Kwik remote you would also be able to
trigger it from there easily but if you
go all the way to the end you can also
edit the list and it is here that you
will see that I have cleaned up the
Quick Settings panel to not include the
brightness and volume sliders which
would then take up even more room there
if you do wish to have more room for
your notifications you can always just
turn those off and that will clean up
your quick settings notification panel
shade very quickly now as you can see
here my home screens are pretty clean I
do like to keep my home screens very
minimalistic when it comes to the icons
on the screen but you see here that I
have the smart bulletin now these are
two areas these top and bottom that will
show you the LG health application and
also some quick tips in their own way
that LG puts in for the phone itself but
you can actually remove that little G on
the bottom here or the smart bulletin
page as it is rather called by heading
over to the app drawer and then coming
down to the home screen settings is in
the home screen settings that you can
turn off the smart bulletin and it will
allow you to turn off that page and free
up some more of that space just kind of
clean things up a little bit more so you
don't actually have that page over there
anymore the other nice thing about the
home screens here is the fact that if
you want them to be as simplistic as
possible unless you actually need to
open applications is that if you were to
pinch out from the screen here in the
home screens it will actually put away
all of your icons I actually think this
is a great feature that you know just
keeps my phone looking as clean as
possible until I actually need to open
something in which case I'll just go
ahead and
Pinchbeck to bring the icons back and
over here if we select what kind of home
we have we just click easy home now for
those of you who really want the most
simplistic experience possible when it
comes to your smartphone easy home is
one way of really setting that up now
I'm back home right now and you can see
there I have the weather widget at the
top I have some quick shortcuts in the
middle right over here for Gmail play
music and a few of the built-in ones
right here and those allow me to get to
some really key functions if I wanted to
dial a number right away from the home
screen is already the place to do that
swipe over to the right and you can add
any number of applications here to be
easily triggered when you want to open
them up very easy very simple to use in
order for you to go back to it to the
original home screen rather you can head
over to the home screen settings you'll
notice that the font is a little bit
bigger here already just to make things
even easier but if I go back to home
screen and select home things go back to
normal
as it were we're here in the general
settings area and you'll see that I'm
trying to head over to accessibility
right here and we have touch zoom right
here touch a zoom basically allows you
to triple tap on the screen and you'll
notice I already have it on and if you
triple tap on the screen you'll see that
the entire operating system or interface
rather becomes a zoomable interface and
from here I can zoom in even more now
this is not typically a place that you
would be able to zoom in and you'll see
I'm using two fingers to slide around
and pinching to zoom and pinching out to
zoom out and it allows you to really be
able to just look at anything on the
phone that you may or may not be able to
see because it's too small just by using
a triple tap and there you go we're back
to normal and then if we come out of the
accessibility area just scroll down a
little bit and we go to security or
security allows you the ability to set a
contact lock for anything in the gallery
so if you have embarrassing photos or
videos or anything like that that you do
want to just keep away from prying eyes
well that is something you can set up
right here I'm setting up a draw pattern
we'll just do an L right there right
there you would basically just hold on
that item or if you wanted to close a
number of different ones you can select
them so let's like these three right
here and we're just go ahead and lock
them and
once they're locked what will happen is
if I wanted to show the locked files I
would have to put in the lock pattern
hit L and there they are these are the
files that are actually locked in the
camera so I can actually see those and
have them away from prying eyes if I so
choose and the final tip that I wanted
to show you is the guest mode now guest
mode is something that you might want to
use if say your kids get their hands on
your smartphone from time to time or if
anybody else does and you just want them
to be able to do very specific things on
the phone well go in and hit guest mode
in the general area just so I can show
you where it is
and then if we talk about the guest mode
it's just a way for for you to really
just show only certain apps that you've
selected for anybody else what we have
here is an allowed app area to allow
just these number of one so let's say I
just wanted to have combo crew which is
a game so we'll go ahead and just head
back there you go we have three apps
that are allowed you have a wallpaper
and a lock screen type for the lock
screen you can set it up for any number
of things so if you do a pattern right
here okay and now what you can do here
is after I set up the pattern for my
general lock screen now we can set up a
pattern to use that will go straight
into guest mode so if you were to give
someone else the phone you would just
put this court code in and from there
you will be able to just get into guest
mode so if you're giving your phone's
anybody else just put in the guest mode
pattern and that's what they're going to
get so if I was going to demonstrate
that for you right now you would just do
it like this
just knock off now gone so if I want to
just get into my interface I would just
put in the usual lock code and then I'll
get in that way but if I want to get
into the guest mode here comes the guest
mode pattern unlock and there you go
there are only these particular
applications that are available and
that's all that that person will be able
to use while I will get notifications
for phones and phone calls and alarms
these are the only three things that I
have allowed them to use in terms of the
applications and so there you have it
for this look at some quick tips and
tricks ten in particular in no
particular order rather for you to be
able to do with your LG g3 when you do
get it there are some really useful tips
in here like I said already there were a
couple that I really did like to use
just to keep things as clean as possible
and from there that is just a sum of
that we have for the LG g3 we have even
more that is available so make sure you
