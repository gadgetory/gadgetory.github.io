around the time of an iphone release
well you know what that means for
Android authority it's Joshua Garth
manager I thought it what's going on
everybody and this is your iPhone 5s and
5c drop tests well it's another year and
it's another iPhone release normally we
compare these new iPhones to some sort
of Android device but since Apple change
it up a little bit and gave us two
devices to work with we're just going to
drop both of them back to back of course
we have the iPhone 5s which is the
updated version of their aluminum clad
flagship phone but the one I know you
want to know about is the 5c and I'm
certainly excited to see how this
plastic or polycarbonate if you want to
get fancy how this plastic phone will
hold up to our drop test guess what
it's drop test that we're going to keep
it around this height and we're going to
just focus on getting into the fall on
its back on one of its sides and then
the one we all know could be the
potential big one on its face here we go
iPhone 5s drop test onto its back from
about chest level
the only real damage that you can see is
in the corner right here where it did
get scuffed this is where the point of
impact was when he landed on its top
corner as usually the aluminum body
holds up pretty well but now we're gonna
see how the iPhone 5s stands to our side
test we're gonna have it land right here
on its bottom all right here we go next
test coming right up whoo
once again the aluminum body still holds
up even though it landed on its corner
nothing happened to the screen because
there's a little bit of a give here on
the aluminum frame but as you can see
right there the aluminum frame did get a
little bit of a scuff all right again
from around chest torso level coming
through hopefully I get a nice flat
impact here and whoa that one was good
whoa that one was good
much like its predecessor the iPhone 5s
still holds up with its build quality we
dropped it on its back on its side and
on its face and as you can see here the
phone still looks pretty nice and for
the most part you can't even tell that
this thing's been dropped aside from the
little scuffs on the corners in the back
that you saw from the previous test the
screen remains intact even after we let
it fall flat on its face really not even
any cracks any scuffs on the screen
whatsoever so the iPhone 5s actually
passes this drop test with some flying
colors
and now here's the moment a lot of you
have been waiting for the iPhone 5c
let's see if the 5c is more than plastic
in a lot of different colors let's find
out if it's durable around chest level
as always and here we go hmm
while the iPhone 5c landed squarely on
its back but this plastic back that
wraps around doesn't look like it has
any damage all right we put it on its
back let's see what happens on its side
iPhone 5c side drop test and I'll well
on the side test what we have here is a
corner hit you can see the scuffs right
there it almost gets over to the screen
but other than that that's pretty much
the only damage we see on the iPhone 5c
thus far all right well the iPhone 5c
seems to be holding up so far but we're
gonna go ahead and give it our face
first test this is where things could
definitely go wrong so we'll see how
that iPhone 5c holds up so here it comes
well as we usually expect when it comes
to iPhones we see the screen shatter we
had a very good impact right on the
front and as you can see here there are
spider webs all over the front of this
phone so the screen definitely shattered
I'm afraid to touch it fertile fear of
getting cut but we're gonna see if it
still is operational and so there you
have it the iPhone 5s and 5c drop test
we did expect the iPhone 5s to hold up
pretty much the way the iPhone 5 did
with this great build quality but we
didn't know what to expect from the
iPhone 5c well judging from this one
test we do see that both of these phones
actually stack up however whereas the
iPhone 5s was able to avoid a shattered
screen by bouncing up and down the
iPhone 5c unfortunately landed straight
on its face and its screen did shatter
but as you can see in the footage here
both ones are still operational so
judging from this one drop test we can
say that both of these phones actually
do hold up and are pretty solid but in
the end it matters what you think so
