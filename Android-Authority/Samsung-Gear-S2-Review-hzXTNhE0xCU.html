with a round SmartWatch that also has a
little bit of out-of-the-box thinking
it's Josh of agar from Android authority
what's going on everybody and here is
your full review of the Samsung gear s2
as is the trend these days for
smartwatches in the Android space
everything is going around and the
Samsung gear s2 follows suit you do have
silicone bands on this particular
version that you're seeing in the case
of this gear s2 however the straps are
proprietary and latch into the stainless
steel body now there is a set of bands
that are available in the box if you
need to change the overall size of the
device and as you can see there already
on the back is the heart rate sensor as
we already mentioned this is a stainless
steel body which makes it feel really
nice and there are two buttons on the
side where the top brings you back a
screen and then the bottom one opens the
apps screen or brings you all the way
back to home and they flank the
microphone but of course the most
important part about this round
construction is the bezel that goes
around this 1.2 inch display that's
because it rotates now this rotating
bezel is one of the new ways of input
that Samsung has put into the gear s2
and it is sublime it is really great to
use and we'll get into that in a little
bit on the gear s2 classic there is a
design on the rotating bezel that makes
it a little bit easier to rotate but
even on the regular gears too you're
seeing here it is not that hard to
rotate the bezel at all and although
there are usually different sizes now
for other smartwatches the gear s2 is
going to come into the smaller body
right here that kind of finds a happy
medium unless you have a really huge
risk then you're not going to think that
this is a very poultry device but that
being said we do think that the
stainless steel body adds a little bit
of heft to it it's a manageable but
still noticeable amount of weight and
what's great is that it remains pretty
inconspicuous it can go along with
pretty much any wardrobe save for maybe
the fanciest of suits and it's not until
you actually start rotating the bezel or
you start using the SmartWatch that
people really tend to notice in a year
full of great Samsung designs in their
hardware at least we do think that the
gear s2 follows that tradition as
Samsung finally got their SmartWatch
right as mentioned before we are working
with a 1.2
display that comes in at 360 by 360
resolution and is made of Samsung's
signature Super AMOLED tech now this
tech does allow for a couple of
different benefits not only does the
ambient light display allow for some
battery savings but it also allows for
some pretty high saturated colors there
are all of the different icons and the
home screens that are available in Tizen
underneath the surface but they did run
into a couple of difficulties regarding
this display now there are some
applications that haven't been adapted
to this new round design just yet and it
shows when you actually get into the
menus and options for them one example
in particular is the watch face I like
to use on here when I want to actually
cater it to the color and everything
that I want you can see that a lot of
the different menu options are just cut
off by the round display but all in all
we will always like AMOLED for
smartwatches because it does provide a
couple of power benefits as well as a
good display experience overall a one
gigahertz processor with half a gigabyte
of RAM powers the Tizen software in the
gear s2 and happens to do so quite
swimmingly really if you used any
Samsung Tizen powered wearables in the
past then you probably notice a little
bit of stutter but that has been
completely eliminated here in the gear
s2 even going through among all of the
different elements whether you're
swiping or using the bezel provides a
very good snappiness and it's almost as
if all of the elements actually click
into place the same way that you would
hear the click the satisfying click from
that rotating bezel but it's in hardware
that we get some of the extras and we'll
start off with the microphone the
microphone found right over here between
the two buttons provides the ability to
do voice actions voice dictation and
voice commands but you're not going to
be taking any calls on the gear s2
because there's no speakerphone or even
connections to cellular networks there
is a 3g version of this device but we'll
get into that in just a second what I
will say is that the voice actions and
voice dictations on here can be pretty
nice especially when you're replying to
messages but s voice in this Tizen
powered SmartWatch happens to be pretty
limited when you compare it to other
iterations like Android wear
connectivity is done through a Bluetooth
connection to a smart phone and I say
smart phone because it doesn't actually
have to be a Samsung device anymore what
you have to do if you're using anything
like say a moto X or any non Samsung
device is just install the Samsung gear
plug-in and manager in order to get the
gear s2 to work
which is awesome but the other nice
feature on here which has been sort of
becoming a thing with Android wear also
recently is that this is also a Wi-Fi
powered version of the watch if you
haven't have your phone somewhere else
or you'll leave it at home but you still
have a Wi-Fi connection that the gear s2
can connect with then both of these
devices can still sync up now it
requires both of the devices to be
connected to a Samsung Account but still
it's nice to be able to get your
notifications even when your phone
happens to not be in your pocket or even
anywhere near you
Bluetooth also gets a boost as you are
able to move music local files over to
the gear s2 now this is another nice
feature if you want to leave your phone
at home
and let's say you want to go out for a
jog but you still want to have your
music on you you can pair a Bluetooth
headset to the gear s2 and you'll be
able to enjoy your music on the go
without even needing to have your phone
anywhere on your person speaking of
jogging Fitness is also an important
part of these wearables and in the gear
s2 you get s health now s health at its
basic level is mostly just a tracker it
will be able to track your steps
throughout the day and you can actually
input your water and caffeine intake but
as a sort of coach the gear s2 is
actually able to track your heart rate
during a particular workout and make
sure that you're still in your
fat-burning zone now while they will be
able to sync up with the s health
application on whatever smartphone you
happen to be using it also is able to
store your workouts inside of the watch
itself but the problem here is that if
you want to use the watch as a
standalone device and track let's say
the type of run that you did and where
you went there's no GPS on the Wi-Fi
only version of this device you have to
have your phone on you so it can track
your location the 3G version of the
watch will have it but that is going to
be a different purchase obviously that
you might have to wait for GPS omission
aside one of the other bad parts about
Fitness on the gear s2 is the fact that
it doesn't yet support some of the
really popular applications that are out
there and of course it's up to
developers to put things like run keeper
or endomondo
on here but if you have the Nike app you
can always use that because it's already
built in or if you happen to use s
health and you do like it and you can
use that as well but there are a lot of
runners out there who are kind of set in
their ways and the gear s2 is not going
to be the best companion for
and finally in battery Samsung has done
well to include a nice magnetic dock
that allows the watch to still be used
as some sort of like a nightstand clock
and basically you just have to lie the
watch down onto the magnetic charging
dock and it will charge from zero to 100
in just over an hour and perhaps it's
because of the Super AMOLED construction
but a 250 milli amp hour battery is
still able to power this device for more
than a day which is better than a lot of
other wearables out there while we
weren't able to get past the 2 day mark
basically we had to plug it in every
other night it was still pretty nice
once you had a lot of the brightness
settings down and maybe you turned off
the ambient display to be able to get
this watch to work even if I forgot to
charge it on any given night that said
however it's probably a good idea to
still charge the device every single
night just so you're not going to want
for power in the middle of your next day
and finally in software you have Tizen
Samsung's own proprietary software that
they bring to the SmartWatch game and
that brings with it good and bad things
first let's start off with the good
Tizen is a breath of fresh air when
compared to all of the different Android
wear smartwatches that are out there and
it brings a sort of different look at
how you can perform on your SmartWatch
especially when you factor in that
rotating bezel the rotating bezel along
with the two buttons on the side and of
course your touch and swipe allow for a
marriage of inputs of sorts so it
actually feels a lot more intuitive
because when you know that the rotating
bezel is how you can get around then
users kind of just gravitate towards it
and of course you can just tap in the
middle to get into various elements and
then use the back and apps buttons to
get to other functions Tizen also adds
in a number of extra functions that
maybe we should have had in other
SmartWatch ecosystems for instance input
when it comes to text allows you a lot
of choice if you get a message and you
want to reply to it there are a bunch of
built in emojis and there are also
canned responses that you can cater to
in the gear manager but there's also
even a t9 keyboard now let's not get it
twisted here the t9 keyboard is not all
that fun to use and it's kind of hard to
use even and you're not going to use it
unless you can actually sit down and
really pinpoint exactly where you're
touching on the screen but otherwise it
is a nice addition that allows a little
bit of extra choice which brings us to
the bad about Tizen unfortunate
it's full application support it's nice
for them to be able to support replying
to various messaging applications but
after that the list is really bare one
look in the gear manager shows you ESPN
Bloomberg Yelp which in and of itself is
a great example of how awesome certain
applications would look in Tizen with
this rotating bezel but after that it
kind of ends productivity apps like
Evernote are missing and even support
for full Google Maps in order to look at
your navigation or missing as well
and what's this hardening is that Tizen
is still considered a fringe ecosystem
developers might not be able to get
their applications on to the gear s2 and
future devices like it because Android
wear is still considered the standard in
the Android Market
the Samsung gear s2 comes in at 299
dollars with its gear s2 classic
brethren coming at 349 which puts it
squarely among all of the other Android
wear offerings available now but isn't
enough to justify the price of course
that's going to be up to you but at
least for us here at Android authority
we have a bit of a love-hate
relationship with the Samsung gear s2
while we absolutely love the design and
the hardware and really this is the
best-looking SmartWatch that Samsung has
ever made unfortunately everything
underneath the surface is just somewhat
lacking even if we were to pick up the
gear s2 and use it as our SmartWatch
during the day we would get frustrated
later on when we realize that one or
many of the functions that we would want
in an Android wear SmartWatch for
example just don't work as well on here
yet what gets us excited about the gear
s2 is that we might see more devices
adopted these kinds of input this
rotating bezel was just absolutely
ingenious and Samsung deserves a lot of
credit for that but with this particular
SmartWatch without to the full
application support it unfortunately
goes a few steps forward but it still
comes back a couple of steps as always
thank you guys very much for watching
and hope you enjoyed this review of the
Samsung gear s2 it's a great SmartWatch
we actually love wearing it and the
hardware design are top-notch by Samsung
but unfortunately the places that it
kind of falls short are the places where
it counts the most and unfortunately
that's the reason why we can't recommend
it more than some of the Android wear
smartwatches that we have seen this year
nonetheless keep it tuned to you for
