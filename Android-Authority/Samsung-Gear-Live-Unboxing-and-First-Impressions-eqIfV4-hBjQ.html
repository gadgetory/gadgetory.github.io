version of their Android wear wearable
but on my doorstep this morning I got
the Samsung version of it so it's Josh
of agarn from Android Authority what's
going on everybody and it's time to
unbox and give my first impressions on
the Samsung gear live alright and the
packaging of the Samsung gear live is
very similar to the kind you would find
on general Samsung devices with this
would ish cardboard apparently made from
sustainable materials so that's always
kind of nice it kind of makes every
single Samsung device kind of a little
bit droll because you expect it to come
in a box like this but that's not what
we're here for we're here for what is
underneath the front the top cover so
let's go ahead and do that and there is
the Samsung gear live this is again
Samsung's version of the Android wear
device in the shape of a gear SmartWatch
you probably are familiar with the gear
the gear to the gear 2 neo all of those
and what I already noticed when I did
the first look at the gear alive is that
it takes on the best parts of the gear
ecosystem well not only does it have the
look of the regular gear 2 or gear 2 neo
because there's no camera but it also
uses as you're going to see right here
the latch on way of putting on the
device to your wrist there's no like
weird latch right here basically it's
just two pins that go into the cuff over
here and then it's really easy to put on
so you'll see a little bit better what
that means in a second when I put this
on my wrist and give you my first
impressions and do the setup but this
you take the watch out of here and there
is some plastic actually a lot of
plastic all around the entire thing but
we'll just put that aside for a second
we have the charger right here which is
actually a wall charger it's not a
microUSB into an adapter and then from
here we have a small connector that
latches on to the back not particularly
the best way of charging something I do
like the LGG watch is flat flat profile
where you'll be able to put the watch
right on to there but this you have to
snap onto the back of the watch in order
to get to charge we'll take a look at
that a little bit more in a bit but at
least for me I'm not the biggest fan of
it and I wasn't on the other
gear devices alright and here we are
with the actual watch itself now there
is a lot of plastic on here that we have
to get off and I'm just going to go
ahead and do that right now comes all
the way around the band comes out to the
front then we're just going to go ahead
and rip that area off and the plastic on
the back should come right off like that
and there you go the Samsung gear live
like I said it pretty much looks like a
gear from the previous gear to gear 2
neo the gear before it but it has the
band that is much like the gear fit
little bit plastic there I'll take that
off and basically it's just a couple of
nubs that go right into this band right
here on the other side and that is a lot
better to me than the system that they
had in place for the gear one the gear 2
and the gear 2 neo I do like this
particular type better so we're just
going to go ahead this just looking
around the device real quick you do see
that there is that heart rate monitor on
the back along with the charging pins
that you're going to see and I'll go
ahead and demonstrate real quick what
that looks like basically you get the
connector pins and you just have to snap
it on to the back and you can hear that
snap right there so that's what it looks
like you can't really lie this thing
flat it does look pretty awkward and it
does feel pretty awkward too I will
admit but you just connect the micro USB
a charging cord into that port and after
that when you're done you just snap it
back off I have been hearing some
reports that certain users have been
noticing that the mechanism that snaps
onto the back here has been breaking so
you might have to take that into
consideration when you're trying to
charge your gear live so just kind of be
careful with it it looks like I actually
held the one button that's over here on
the side as you can see right there
there's the button and we're going to
get into the operating system right now
alright and looking at the actual setup
right now I have Android wear open right
now and it is connected to my LG G watch
at the moment but I will usually just be
able to pair it with a new wearable as
you can see right there so let's go
ahead and hit English right here and it
says to install Android wear on there
which I do already
just say except to everything and it
will start searching for the device and
there it is gear live and the connection
should be fairly easy just hit pair on
both the set up is nice and quick
everything should be all set and I
already have applications that are
installed on my phone so they should be
getting synced over to the watch right
now and the experience for the most part
should be the same the only thing that
will be different for the most part is
that I can check my heart rate using
this and it will sync to Google fit
which is the apparatus that is on
Android wear in order for you to track
your steps but also your heart rate in
the case of the gear live because it's
the only SmartWatch at the moment that
has the heart rate monitor for Android
wear all right so I have the gear live
right here I'm just going to go and put
it on to my wrist I have removed my LG G
watch so I will be using this over the
next couple days as I do my review on
the G watch which I pretty much know
what to be able to say there but as you
can see right here it says it's
downloading at the moment all of the
applications and probably updates to
this particular watch itself so we won't
be able to use it right away but I can
give you my first impressions as far as
the feel of the device because Android
wear aside from the heart rate monitor
on the bag is going to feel largely the
same so let's just go ahead and throw
this on now the curve of the actual
device allows for a curve on the band
and that's why the band thankfully has
just those two nubs that will just snap
right in and right there that way it
will fit pretty easily I'm not going to
lie it is pretty nice and comfortable
not to say that's more comfortable than
the LG G watch actually do think they're
both pretty comparable in terms of their
fits but the gear life gets a couple of
points because that curve does make it
easier to put on and those knobs do make
it easier to put on as well but that's
really just a personal preference
after that the curve does contour to the
wrist pretty easily and I am looking
forward to using this over the next
couple days because it's going to give
me basically the the experience that I
have been fostering on Android wear on
the LG G watch except I'm just going to
do it on here that's the nice part about
Android wear is the fact that you will
be able to have it no matter what
SmartWatch you use as long as you use
Android wear the application and you use
one that's compatible with it and yeah
it does feel really nice you have this
rubbery feel right here on the plastic
band
and then as far as the finish on the
watch goes it does have a pretty premium
feel it actually looks pretty nice the
only thing that's missing is a little
camera right here at the front so you
won't be able to take pictures with this
like on the gear too but nonetheless
that's not the focus of the gear live
obviously it's all about Android wear
and that's what we're going to be seeing
right here on the gear live in an
upcoming review so keep it tuned to
Android 34 all the best coverage and
