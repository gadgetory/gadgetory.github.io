don't you think that that's a great
phone it's a good comeback for Sony I
think it's an awesome foundation you
should be really popular but yeah I'm
glad you like it
all right so you know this is a review
unit I'm supposed to review this so if
it's broken no one's gonna love me
anymore all right
just oh this is actually uh oh I forgot
so it's a lot of resistant fun we're
good then we're good man
hey this Joshua car from Android
Authority what's going on everybody
you've been waiting for it we've been
waiting for it and it's finally here
because this is the Sony Xperia Z oh
come on Sony is looking to crack the top
three list of smartphone Giants with
this latest and greatest offering the
Xperia Z but does it bring a lot to the
table well the short answer is yes the
Xperia Z does get a lot right in many
key aspects so let's see what Sony is
packing into its new flagship phone
obviously the first thing you notice is
the design this angular or rectangular
design is honestly something we don't
see enough of it's like with cars
everything is curved now but we missed
the old days of boxier designs pretty
much the entire phone is covered in
tempered glass and gives the phone a
great black slate look with a flat look
all around it is certainly one of the
best phones that Sony has ever put out
the flatness has helped by a myriad of
port covers that are obviously there to
help with the water resistance
everything is covered by a removable
piece of material the ports include a
headphone jack at the top with a
charging port and yes a micro SD card
slot around the other corner the real
story here however is the button layout
which Sony has gotten right considering
the larger form factor due to the 5-inch
screen
all buttons are on the right side which
are the volume rockers and the power
button they are right where your thumb
would land and it makes the handling of
the phone even easier that silver power
button is also a great focal point that
adds to the phone's already great look
that rectangular feel believe it or not
actually helps with the handling of the
phone it's easy to grip the flat sides
of the phone and it never felt
uncomfortable well with the 5-inch
screen you will have to perform some
hand gymnastics but at least the button
layout helps one thing you should know
though the glass coverings are
incredibly fingerprint prone if you show
this phone off to your friends maybe you
should have a cloth handy speaking of
the screen it's definitely what you
expect this TFT capacitive screen
displays at 1080p resolution and has a
density of 441 PPI those are pretty much
what you would want from a screen
gracing what is supposed to be a
top-tier device speaking of 441 PPI all
is very crisp and sharp here as you can
see from the text
as expected video viewing is great on
the Xperia Z the Bravia Engine does seem
to do its job making the viewing
experience even more wonderful though a
good refresh rate has a hand in it too
if you've ever seen a bravia televisions
incredibly smooth motion due to that
refresh rate you get a taste of it here
unfortunately despite the fun you'll
have on this display I do have to
nitpick on the color rendering colors
lack of vibrancy then they actually look
quite washed out it gets a little bit
worse when you get outside in broad
daylight you will need the phone at the
highest possible level to make it
comfortably viewable outside and the
viewing angles actually don't help
things get further washed out when
angled and you'll get the best out of
the screen only when you view it dead-on
that being said however this is a screen
that still brings a great viewing
experience a good example comes from the
HD trailer that is built-in when you
watch it the trailer looks like it's
playing on a tiny theater screen the
colors even though they may not be quite
too vibrant or what we usually see from
a trailer at the theater it's kind of
like you're seeing it exactly the way
Sony really wanted you to and you know
what that's really not bad at all of
course you won't be able to enjoy all of
this without the power to back it up
thankfully Sony knows what's going big
in the android market and put in just
what the Xperia Z needed the Snapdragon
s4 pro processor clocks in at 1.5
gigahertz and is backed by the
tried-and-true Adreno 320 graphics
processor and then 2 gigabytes of RAM is
what you will get from multitasking now
this is a graphics package that powers
some of the top current Android
smartphones so it's no surprise that it
appears here as far as the benchmarks go
they are really very great the Xperia Z
is the first phone I have seen or
reviewed that breaks the twenty-thousand
barrier in the n22 benchmark application
quadrant and Vilmos scores are also very
high and you can see them in my written
review the big story in the hardware
however is the microSD slot many people
have lamented over the lack of removable
batteries and expandable memory and even
top-tier offerings so even though you
don't get to pop out that battery you do
get to pop in a micro SD card if you
need more storage than the 16 or 32
gigabytes that might be built in this is
yet another detail that sony gets right
in the Xperia Z
speaking of the battery it holds the
typical hope of proper capacity for a
5-inch screen as has been the case for
pretty much every five inch phone on the
market today it yields mixed results
tests have shown it to have a great
amount of talking time in a decent
amount of web browsing time but video
playback which is the test I use yielded
just over five and a half hours of
straight viewing the Xperia Z should be
able to go the distance and day to day
usage with no problems
nightly charging is a reality we all
live with but at least you won't run out
of juice in an opportune moment there
there are some nice options for stamina
mode and power savings so taking
advantage of those will likely extend
your time with the Xperia Z even further
but now we get to the camera the rear
camera is the story here with its 13
megapixel Exmor RS powered optics
capable of HDR sweeping panorama and
various other scene related picture
modes superior Auto is a feature unique
to Xperia S it analyzes the scene to
figure out the best settings to properly
expose the photo for the most part it is
pretty accurate these pictures are at 9
megapixels with a 16 by 9 aspect ratio
this is more my style than 4 by 3 and
apparently it's also Sony's because that
was the default setting as is the
typical result pictures with adequate
lighting yield pretty great results with
colors being rendered quite well with a
shallow depth of field because of a
decent
aperture speed superior auto seems to do
the job fairly well and thus pictures
are exposed properly the flash it does
help in very low light shots but having
the right lighting helps in this and
really all types of photography video
can be recorded at 1080 P Full HD
resolution and it was demonstrated
already as always in my intro ultimately
it's a step closer to replacing your
point-and-shoot camera if only by a
small margin it's better described as a
great companion to have in your pocket
for those type moments luckily you'll
probably get some pretty great shots in
the nick of time and lastly we look at
the software the first things you notice
are the black and grey tones that Sony
seems to employ often in their designs
the general layout is reminiscent of
Android Ice Cream Sandwich with these
darker tones and white or neon blue hues
and that kind of imitation isn't really
a bad
thing because this interface thus has a
minimalistic beauty to it this is
however jellybean 4.1 which is still
behind in the OS game but the Xperia Z
deserves credit for being somewhat
up-to-date you get Google now here
coupled with some of Sony's own tweaks
like a power widget in the notification
drop-down and a unique launcher
customizer you even get to remove or add
more home screens which to me is a
welcome addition sony designs
applications do make appearances here
like the gallery which is called album
and the walkman app perhaps the most
notable though are the small apps which
are accessible in the recent apps screen
from there you can select from an
expandable list of small apps that run
as an overlay over whatever you already
have running it's a nice way to get even
more multitasking done all in all the
Xperia Z whether it knows it or not
manages to give you the best of multiple
worlds by including jellybean features
in a more ICS style with Sony's own apps
built in it does just enough to be
different while bringing what people
love about stock Android along and that
deserves quite a bit of credit and so
there you have it Sony's new flagship
phone really does get a lot of things
right with its great design wonderful
specifications a more than decent camera
and accessible software the water
resistance might not be something that
you will use all the time but it is a
great party trick and is sure to impress
your friends coming in at almost $800
unlocked however you are paying a real
premium for one of the most anticipated
phones of 2013 this phone is definitely
coming to the States but we don't
currently know for what carriers or in
what different ways if any it will come
in nonetheless this is certainly Sony's
coming-out party and if hours and plenty
of others experiences are any indication
the company definitely now deserves to
be among the best in the cell phone and
smartphone market for all of the
upcoming Xperia Z news and features stay
tuned to android authority calm your
