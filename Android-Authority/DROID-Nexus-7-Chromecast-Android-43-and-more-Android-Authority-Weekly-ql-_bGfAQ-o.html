brought to you by netflix head to
netflix.com / android for a free 30-day
trial isn't it great to finally get some
real releases rather than just leaks and
rumors this week we got a new lineup
from Motorola the new Nexus 7 was
finally unleashed and now we also have a
new way of watching online content oh
and we also got more Moto X leaks hey
Josh of a guard from android authority
what's going on everybody and it's time
for another dose of the week's top
Android news it's android authority
weekly after months of hearing about the
new flagship phone by motorola the Moto
X was actually put aside this week in
lieu of a brand new lineup of droid
phones verizon's droid event this past
week was covered very well by Chris and
he actually made a rundown video for all
of you so if you haven't seen it yet
make sure you check it out when you have
a chance anyway Motorola effectively
bolstered verizon's device lineup by
introducing three new droids the droid
mini the droid ultra and the droid maxx
the droid mini is the smallest of the
bunch coining the phrase compact without
compromise we're looking at a smaller
phone that definitely brings the power a
4.3 inch 720p screen is backed up by a
rather mysterious mobile computing
system currently called the motorola x8
which consists of a quad-core GPU a
dual-core cpu and a couple single core
processors for contextual computing and
natural language processing respectively
the droid ultra looks to fulfill the
promise of its name by bringing an
incredible experience in what Motorola
claims is the thinnest Android set
available it is just over seven
millimeters thick you get a 5 inch 720p
display on here with the motorola x8
mobile computing system and a 10
megapixel clear pixel camera that is
found across all three devices the Droid
Maxx is perhaps the most anticipated of
the bunch as any battery life blows you
may have had in the past will be solved
by its 3500 milliamp hour battery
sporting all of the same inner specs as
the ultra you'll have the X a processing
package that the max claims will run for
48 hours
all three of these new droid sport
features we saw in moto x leaks like the
open mic I think it's pretty safe to say
that Motorola is right back in the game
with their new offerings or at the very
least they made quite the splash this
past week you can pre-order all of these
new droids at Verizon and they will ship
on August twentieth and from one press
event we move on to another Google had
its breakfast event this past week and
brought us a couple of very well
received updates and one product that
just might be a sleeper hit I did the
rundown video for that particular event
so if you still haven't seen it make
sure you check it out for all of the
in-depth information Android 4.3 was
finally made official and brings with it
optimizations on top of few new features
mainly support for a nude OpenGL system
and restricted profiles that are more or
less like parental controls it ships on
the new Nexus 7 and should be made
available to other Nexus devices in due
time even though plenty of people have
been expressing their disdain over not
getting it yet and like expected the
Nexus devices are getting them first but
the google play editions of the samsung
galaxy s4 and HTC One are going to get
it soon as for OEM Sony is currently the
only one to come forward stating that
they are currently working on getting
4.32 the Xperia line in the near future
and then we move on to the Nexus 7 the
new slimmer thinner and all-around more
powerful tablets the hotly anticipated
7-inch tablet is finally here with a
slightly smaller but overall much better
handling profile and better bits
underneath the Snapdragon s4 pro the
Audrina 322 gigabytes of RAM and 16
gigabytes on the base model oh and
there's also a 5 megapixel camera on it
now you can get the new Nexus 7 now for
229 dollars on the base model and 269
dollars for the 32 gigabyte model oh and
finally the chromecast an extremely
affordable $35 peripheral that makes any
hdmi capable TV a smart TV what was once
the Nexus Q essentially has been
shrunken down and streams content
straight from outlets like YouTube and
Netflix plenty of people have been
flocking to the chromecast and for good
reason it's got great potential all of
which was outlined by
our own dare across in a look on how the
chromecast has just helped the living
room evolve so we got our new Nexus 7
but what about our next is 10 the larger
tablet by Google and Samsung had a near
perfect to first attempt and now we
can't wait to see what they have in
store for the next one well someone from
The Wall Street Journal got to talk to
sundar pichai who gave us a signature of
Google tease apparently the Nexus 10 is
coming out in the near future it's nice
to know we're getting our Nexus devices
soon as all we have left then is the
Nexus 5 and then hopefully Android
five-point but of course we can't go
long without more Moto X leaks this
week's leak brought us a little bit more
information about the build of the phone
and a possible accessory supposedly the
Moto X will sport moto magic glass which
is basically a slab of Gorilla Glass
molded in such a way as to create a gap
free surface all around the phone it
could also feature dual LTE antennas
along with another antenna for two or
three G instead of the usual one antenna
that handles both and finally the fabled
SmartWatch that Google was supposedly
working on might be launched with the
Moto X on August first in the end we're
just waiting with bated breath for
whatever moto and google has in store
for us on the first and so there you
