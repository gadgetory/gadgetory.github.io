lot of you are talking about foldable
displays so let's talk about how and why
they could be a game-changer and the
first impact it could have is simple but
a welcome one increasing human
interaction like in the spirit of the
80s when they played battleship you
could face each other and play the same
game on the same device or you could
just face the humiliation while I teabag
you on fortnight
think of the possibilities with
one-on-one teaching and tutoring or
giving some sort of a business
presentation or pitch to investors and
think about all the PC geeks out there
who love having multiple displays for
multitasking why can't there be a
similar impact when it comes to mobile
devices it's possible the recent apps or
multitasking menu on Android was very
popular because it speeds up how quickly
you could access a previous app but what
if you could pin the previous app or
most used app to one of your screens
sounds enticing yeah that's pretty
helpful
you could also mean that cameras will
get even better than they already are
you see front-facing cameras are geared
towards selfies portrait images and
video calling rear cameras are dedicated
to everything else this leads to one
camera being worse than the other as
manufacturers try to optimize their
spending and resources with folding
phones specifically outward folding
phones the main camera can act as both
the front and rear camera depending on
whether the device is open or closed
this would mean that manufacturers could
focus on one exceptional camera rather
than splitting their attention between
two and freeing up valuable space inside
the handset for other components another
big benefit fewer cracked screens as
foldable displays must be flexible by
nature this should be far less likely to
shatter in an accidental trip to the
floor and finally the biggest benefit in
my mind is the fact that we will enter a
new category of devices which means that
we won't get products that pretty much
all look and function the same but I
told you before I remain a skeptic and I
do I am not convinced that foldable
displays will indeed be the next big
thing that everyone gets
sited about I think it is going to be
wearables I know it some of your
thinking you thinking wearables god they
suck they really haven't taken off but
if you think back you probably can't
think back because you're too young but
in the early 2000s before the iPhone
came out we had smartphones
I had the palm treo we had blackberries
blackberry really totally dominated that
that space but the palm treo was trying
to be the iPhone right they had I was a
phone their productivity apps they had
an operating system they even had some
games but it was such a bad experience
that I just stopped using the phone I
mean it was so bad that I'd rather not
have a phone at all than use the palm
tree oh that's how bad the tree home was
but then the iPhone came out and they
did the same thing they just did it much
much better in fact they did it so well
that they created a whole industry and
quite frankly it's the reason you watch
a video on mobile operating systems and
no I'm not talking about stupid glasses
that no one should have ever thought
would take it off or earpieces that
don't really work or clunky and hard to
connect I'm talking about some sort of
wearable device or devices or
combination thereof that extends the
usability of our smartphones and makes
us not have to look at this tiny little
screen to access what we want but opens
up the world I'm telling you it's gonna
happen when and where and by who I don't
know let me know what you think in the
comments below or on Twitter IT people
know how this works you're trying to do
focus productive work on your screen but

tree with IT alerts and notifications

distracted but you can reduce that noise
