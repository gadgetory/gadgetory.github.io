surveillance and even spying I've been
wondering is my Android smartphone
spying on me is someone activating the
microphone maybe and sending data across
the Internet well I develop the
technique where as able to capture all
the data that flows in out of my phone I
was able to analyze it to see exactly
what's happening
hi there my name's Gary Sims this is
Andrew authority if you want to find out
more please let me explain
it's a privacy is always in the news and
quite rightly so what a googol doing
what a Facebook doing there's also other
things going on about media telecom
providers what a why are we doing what
our other Chinese om is doing our people
being spied upon if not by their own
government but by other governments so
to tackle this problem I thought I would
really get down to the lowest level and
capture all the data that is flowing
back and forth from my phone and then
analyze it to see what is happening when
I say phone actually I mean several
phones including a huawei phone a Google
phone a pixel three excel a Samsung and
the oneplus 16 so are any of these foes
doing naughty things that they shouldn't
be so the capture of a database he's
like got a Raspberry Pi and I turned it
into an access point that means it's
Wi-Fi chip is used to broadcast just
like a normal Wi-Fi router would and the
phone under the test was able to connect
to the Raspberry Pi the same way we
connect to my router and then using the
Ethernet port on the Raspberry Pi I
can't do that to the Internet so what
that basic means now if the Raspberry Pi
is in the middle everything that comes
from the phone over the Wi-Fi has to
flow through the Raspberry Pi and then
out onto the internet and it was it
comes in from these that has to flow
again through the Raspberry Pi then over
the Wi-Fi and onto my phone and then
using a tool like Wireshark I'm able to
capture all of that data now the
advantage is the capturing approaches
that you can capture now and ask
questions later which means I could
leave the phone running overnight and
see whether maybe at 3 o'clock in the
morning whether the data was being
secretly sent while I was asleep and
then that way I wouldn't know
but I would to capture a whole nights
worth of data and then analyze it at my
leisure and I analyzed absolutely every
single packet of data and once I was
happy with a certain destination once I
was happy with a certain time of
connection I was able to cross it off my
list and then whittled down the list to
see if there were things going on that
shouldn't be happening further I said I
took four phones while a maid ate a
pixel three excel a samsung galaxy note
9 and a one plus 60 I kicked in this
network and then I tracked them for at
least 24 hours to see what they were
doing and this is what I found out so
the first thing I notice is that our
phones talk a lot to Google and of
course we expect that because of course
the whole of Android comes from Google
Playstore from Google Google searches
from Google YouTube is from Google you
know the list just goes on and on and on
Gmail is from Google but actually we
surprised just how much of the traffic
is actually sent towards Google servers
and that certainly got me thinking about
how much do Google really know about us
and I'll deal with that in a moment
now another usually thing is that Google
owned a lot of domain names I was
expecting all the traffic to go to
something or other google.com but
actually Google has got a whole bunch of
domain names that they use for a whole
different bunch of different purposes
and I list all those in the article that
goes with this video and you'll find the
link to that in the description below so
assuming it's okay that our phones talk
to Google because that's the ecosystem
where else do our phones talk to and a
really big part of the traffic besides
Google is actually to ad networks now if
we think about all those free games that
you've got on all the free apps that
you've got that are supported by ads
well all that data is being communicated
with several different ad networks now
here we have a bit of a problem because
developers app developers will just
develop their apps they put a lot of
time and s into making the app and then
they pick an ad network maybe one from
Google maybe one from somewhere else and
they just use their libraries and suck
them directly into their app and then
just publish it now really at that point
the app developer doesn't really know
what the ad network is doing so you may
find that the ad network is kind of
requests
different types of information and it's
actually looking for different things
that maybe the app developer doesn't
know and all that information is being
sent to the ad networks of course if the
ad networks were trustworthy this
wouldn't be much of an issue but we know
from our daily usage of the web that ad
providers are not trustworthy when we
talk about pop-unders and pop-ups and
auto-playing videos and inappropriate
adverts and all these full screen ads
it's like um we know that advertisers
will actually do whatever they can to
get an extra bit of money out of us so
it's interesting that we use a lot of
these freemium type games we use a lot
of these free apps but in doing that we
are exposing ourselves to an extent to
the Adhan providers who are kind of
trying to work out who we are and what
demographic we're in and what location
were in and you know what kind of phone
we have and what our preferences are so
that they can send us ads and that's all
happening in the background without
really much control from our side
another place I saw a lot of traffic go
to was actually to Amazon's web services
now you might think if you're only using
it's an Amazon product let's say you
know like Kindles and like that then
maybe it will talk to Amazon because
Amazon are a huge web service provider a
cloud hosting provider and so many apps
actually opt to use Amazon as the place
where they keep their databases as they
have kind of some background processing
going on and I'll find that a lot of our
traffic goes over to generic Amazon web
servers because there is hosted some
server that an app of ours is using and
that's okay because I assume we can
trust Amazon to provide those services
but of course we don't know what those
services are actually doing so though
Amazon is a well-known popular company
actually an app on our phone could be
sending all kinds of information over to
their private server which just happens
to be hosted by Amazon now of course
Android tries to help in that situation
you've got permissions you know do you
grab this app permissions to your
contacts for example well no I don't
know why you know a torch flashlight app
should have
access to my contacts because I don't
want those uploaded onto the Internet
and of course it's also the Google Play
protect which where Google are
attempting to check the sort of the
validity of an app to make sure that it
isn't doing things they shouldn't do but
it's interesting that Amazon features
quite heavily in the traffic that flows
in and out of our devices and since I
had this ability to track every single
packet that was going in out of my
phones I wanted to see what it was like
with Google assistant our Google
secretly listening to everything I'm
saying and sending it up into the cloud
so I was able to test the idea to verify
the idea that Google tellers which is
that date was only sent to the cloud
once we actually trigger the assistant
with you know either a squeeze or
pressing on the write button or saying
the key word which I won't repeat now
because all the people moan that I
repeat the word activate all of their
Google devices so I won't say the word
but hey something or other that
activates Google so actually what I did
was I looked at the real-time traffic
and I can say that all on all the phones
I tested whether it was a why away with
it as a Google phone didn't matter
there's no data flowing while you're
just looking at the phone using the
phone even talking directly at the phone
nothing at the moment you activate
Google assistant all of those things or
the sound around you is sent real-time
up to Google servers all of it and I'll
get more into that in just a second and
that flow of data traffic in real time
continues until either you complete
command or until the times out because
it didn't hear anything from you that
was legible and so what actually happens
is that why you're just kind of using
the phone there is a device or probably
a DSP on your phone that's listening for
you to say the key word and then once
you say it it will send that key word up
to Google to double check on the bigger
more powerful processors that that's
actually what you said and then it will
activate the Google sit and then all the
things you say including the background
noise get sent up to Google for
processing now I tried tricking the key
word so you know rather than saying
hey I kind of said words that were
similar like you know pray you know or
okay goggle for example to see whether
that triggered the keyword and it
doesn't the the keyword recognition on
the device is pretty pretty accurate
once out of many many attempts I got it
to send up some traffic and I was
monitoring this sent some traffic to
Google and it wasn't the right thing and
then for the assistant wasn't activated
and further traffic was not sent up to
Google servers so from that I concluded
this is that the keyword activation is
pretty good it's double checked by
Google servers and if it isn't a true
positive match it does not listen to
what you're saying but the moment is
activated everything gets sent up there
and I'm going to talk one more about
that in a minute when we talk about
Google takeout so before we get on to
Google what do we think about Facebook
Twitter whatsapp and all these other
social media apps that we use well the
truth is that we are sending data to
those companies willingly so actually
what's happening is that you're
willingly posting your name and your
date of birth and your friends and your
photos and your location and you know
what your preferences are across these
different social networks and you're
actually sending all that information
willingly up to Facebook or Twitter or
to to Instagram or whatever so there's
not really much of a privacy issue here
because you're doing it willingly so
let's just talk about Google for a
second Google have a service called
takeout which allows you to download all
the data that Google has about you now
I'm going to do a separate video on just
that entire process over on the Gary
explains channel so do make sure you go
over there and check that out but having
done that for myself there was a couple
of thing I just wanted to point out that
were quite scary first of all of course
we know that Google has everything about
me all my emails are in Google all my
photos are in Google you know I search
Google engine I watch videos on youtubes
of course Google has all that
information it knows what I've searched
for it knows what we're in my emails it
knows what photos are taken it knows my
location so all that stuff is there but
the thing to remember is that Google
keeps it Google keep
that date doesn't just keep it for a day
I've got records when I did my takeout
going back to 2015 2014 because Google
keeps hold of all of it so remember that
whatever you do on Google it's in a
permanent record somewhere now there's a
whole different issue about who has
access to that but the data exists it
exists somewhere on a server that can
demonstrate certain things about what
you've done and where you've done it and
so on and the other thing that I found
pretty interesting was that all of those
Google assistant commands that I said to
my Google home Mini are stored in mp3 on
Google servers and when you do the
takeout you get a big file of all the
mp3 files of commands that you have said
now that's okay when I've said you know
Google you know turn up the volume to
50% or whatever but an interesting way
is what I've activated Google then
someone comes into the room and says
dinner's ready
let's just use something benign and I've
then not completed my command with
Google and I've stopped it and I've gone
off to dinner now that call dinner's
ready has been recorded in this in an
mp3 file sitting on Google servers now
imagine someone said something more
delicate to you imagine someone said
something that you don't want recorded
actually the moment you activated Google
assistant all of that data including
commands it didn't do what they were
meant to do are recorded up there for
Google now on the garrix baby let me do
it I'm gonna play some of those for
example the background noise that exists
in some of my own personal recordings so
you can see what kind of things Google
have about you a lot more quick thing to
mention about Google takeout is that it
has a complete history of all the things
I've purchased online and when I mean
all the things I mean from Amazon from
eBay from iTunes even airplane tickets
and I'll go more into detail of that in
the garrix phase video but Google have a
copy of all of your purchases that
you've made online even the ones that
are not even associated with Google in
any way whatsoever
so you want to find out why that is go
and watch that video on gary explains ok
so let's talk about spying in terms of
espionage for a moment if you go back
before
the advent of the smartphone of course
every major government secret police spy
agency was involved across the world in
surveillance of one kind or another it's
important for national security is one
argument and that is certainly true in
certain areas but of course in those
days it was a case of well send a white
van outside the house point a
directional microphone up to the window
big long lens on the camera let's try to
spy on this person and that still
happens today of course traditional spy
craft traditional espionage traditional
surveillance is still occurring the
difference is with the advent of
smartphones what's actually happened is
now is that every person is carrying
around a camera and a microphone in
their pocket now is there a way for
Google to activate that in their normal
way no there isn't is there a way for
Facebook to activate that in the normal
way no there isn't
will at Google or Facebook activate that
if a police federal agency comes as we
would activate the microphone on Garrett
oh no that won't happen but recent
events for example surrounding the Saudi
Arabia's for example have shown that
there are ways of activating people's
phones unknowingly and that is because
all software has bugs in it all
software's written by people and they
write the software and it has errors in
it and there are things called zero-day
exploits which means it's a bug that's
unknown so it's been known for zero
number of days Google or Apple or
Microsoft had zero days and no days to
try to fix it and companies sell those
bugs how they can access through a bug
not through a backdoor but through an
error in the software how they can
access phones make them activate their
you know microphones reactivate their
cameras and they sell them to state
nation states for millions of dollar
mean millions of dollars like five
million dollars and so when you have a
nation state that wants to perform
surveillance on a particular individual
for them five million in the overall
budget of a large country is nothing
they pay it they get a way of accessing
individuals phones because they
effectively use unknown and intent
all ways into the phone of course Apple
and Google and Microsoft ran very hard
to close all of those doors or those
loopholes all those mistakes but if it's
zero date means is unknown so they have
no way of actually trying to fix it and
so can someone spy on you well can your
neighbor know can Google know Carnation
state yes if they buy the right zero day
exploits from a security company and
we've just had recent confirmation of
that of course in recent history so
there you go so does that all mean in
summary do companies like Google and
Facebook and tweeter know about us yes
they do we willingly give them loads of
data we willingly post things on social
media we willingly reveal so much about
ourselves and companies like Google
because the whole of Android is tied
into Google everything we do get sucked
up into Google's massive networks and
servers including our location including
you know the books that we've read
including that phrase we've searched for
including the videos we've watched and
Twitter for example state very clearly
in their privacy policy that they will
use your tweets the tweets that you
retweet the tweets that you like and
things like that to determine your
language your gender your age group and
other indicators about who you are so
that they know and can profile who you
are and they can try to sell you
advertising of course that is the key to
make money from you and if Twitter do
that and they say that very clearly in
their privacy policy all the companies
do that and so they are profiling you so
they can say new things so you just be
cautious about what you're posting and
where you're posting it because someone
somewhere is gonna read it so in sum we
did I find any actual activity that I
didn't expect on these phones no there
were no secret messages being sent off
to servers in China or Russia or North
Korea or wherever you think a bad guy is
gonna sit with his server or the traffic
look to be legitimate from the very
beginning
okay so your hawawa phone is
spying on you okay I tested it whatever
is not spying on you your pixel xl3 is
not spying on you but there are
legitimate things that are covered by
privacy policies that we've all signed
up to that all these companies are
taking advantage of that is an absolute
fact and so there you go my name's Gary
Sims this is Andrew authority I do hope
you enjoyed this video if you did please
do give it a thumbs up don't forget to
subscribe don't forget to check out the
garrix plays video channel and well
that's it I'll see you next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
