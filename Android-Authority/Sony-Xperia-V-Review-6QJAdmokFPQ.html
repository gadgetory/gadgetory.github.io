the Walkman and cyber-shot Sony Ericsson
phones back in the day and as great as
those phones were it doesn't seem like
Sony is at the top of the list when it
comes to smartphone manufacturers these
days but the experience is hoping to
change all that with some unique
features and some very very interesting
developments hey this is Joshua Berger
from Android authority what's going on
everybody and this is a fish bowl full
of water and this is the Sony Xperia v
yes as you saw in the intro this is a
phone capable of working even after
being immersed in water you can even get
a glimpse of it right on the box while
it is quite a great feature of this
phone there is more it can offer from
top to bottom it's no secret that we
like the design of the sony xperia
phones here at Android Authority and
even though this is my first foray into
the Xperia line I have to agree
the 4.3 inch screen is surrounded by a
black bezel that sees the speaker at the
top by the notification light and the
front camera there are no dedicated
capacitive buttons for navigation
instead you get soft keys much like that
found at vanilla Android systems found
on Nexus devices the button layout you
might be used to is in Sony style as the
volume rocker and power buttons have
been shrunken down and put on the same
side it might take a little bit to get
used to but having all the buttons
accessible on one side is actually kind
of useful on the opposite side is the
charging port covered by a protective
piece of plastic much like the headphone
jack at the top now these covers are
obviously provided to add to the expiry
of ease waterproofing but in my
experience no less with Sony Ericsson
phones they can break off after a lot of
usage coming around the back the white
cover is actually detachable and allows
access to the replaceable battery and
the two slots made from micro sim and
microSD cards above the Xperia logo is
the 13 megapixel camera and flash diode
a silver lining separates this back
portion from the front panel altogether
giving this phone a very nice aesthetic
only at the bottom can one see that the
back half of the phone is a little bit
bigger than the front panel it and the
top are the thickest parts of the Xperia
v
the result is a curved design along the
back that makes the middle portion
lighter than the top and bottom which
are a little heavier coincidentally this
makes the phone very balanced in the
hand and the slightly smaller size
compared to other devices with 4.7 inch
screens helps as well
speaking of the screen it might come in
at only 4.3 inches but I think a lot of
users will find that a happy medium TFT
capacitive display is capable of
displaying 16 million colors at 1280 by
720 resolution it is quite a crisp
display as a result but the text is
given a very welcome sharpness due to
the 342 PPI density interestingly enough
the multi-touch specs state that this
screen is capable of registering touches
from up to 10 fingers now I have no idea
how to test that many presses at once
but turning on the option in developer
settings to display touches showed that
this multi-touch is indeed functional
all in all this is a display capable of
giving an enjoyable experience however
it isn't the brightest display I have
ever worked with colors then are crisp
and detailed but lack of vibrancy that
I'm used to from other devices screens
this screen could use a little more
brightness and a bit more contrast to
make the colors take precedence over the
black and gray tones of the Xperia v's
theme
tucked under the display is a number of
worthwhile features added in that make
the Xperia v an attractive package and
these are found under the back cover
even some top-tier devices no longer
come with a replaceable battery or
expandable memory but the Xperia v
manages to put all of that into the
smaller body pop off the back cover and
you'll find a slot for an SD card that
you will likely use because only eight
gigabytes are included otherwise you'll
probably take advantage of replacing
that battery too because with 4G LTE
enabled you might run out of juice
before your day is over now these are
nice features to have on a device this
size and it makes you wonder why
top-tier device manufacturers can't
sometimes find a way to include them
connectivity is standard on this device
as the basic bells and whistles are
included GPS Wi-Fi Bluetooth and NFC the
Xperia v is capable of all major 3G
bands as well as 4G LTE as I mentioned
but it does lack support for 4G HSPA+ so
t-mobile might not be the way to go with
this ultimately the Xperia v does have
quite a bit to offer over even some
top-tier devices so we're going to have
to see if it's performance can keep up
a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor is
included in the Xperia v and clocks out
at 1.5 gigahertz it does the Krait
variation and is backed up by one
gigabyte of RAM and in Adreno two to
five graphics processor off the bat one
would see that these specs are well
below those found in the likes of the
nexus 4 and the HTC One x+ but the
optimization still yields a pretty
smooth and snappy experience even the
startup is quite fast going from power
button to full functionality in just
under a minute there is some lag in
particular parts of the experience
especially when opening intensive apps
like games unfortunately a little can
also be noticed on the home screens but
I did find that this is only one a
widget hasn't loaded its information yet
perhaps unsurprisingly then the
benchmark tests put the Xperia v well
below the top of the Android Market just
above the original HTC One X and below
the Samsung Galaxy s3 performance then
is just above average at best the
average user won't have many qualms with
the speed or the usage of the Xperia v
but power users will be wanting just a
little bit more
which brings me to the camera as a
former user of Sony Ericsson cyber-shot
phones I actually had some high
expectations for the one found in this
expiry of II I'm really happy to report
that this is actually a very good camera
it would seem that Sony hasn't lost its
touch with optics on its phones and the
Xperia v is a fine example of this the
app first of all has a nice looking
interface much like that found in the
jellybean app HDR panorama and even
various toy effect modes are available
to modify your shot with an aperture of
F to the scammer is capable of taking
pictures with some good depth of field
and makes a good quality photos under
even some less than adequate lighting
situations touch focusing is quick and
responsive in the camera app and after
specifying an area to focus the camera
easily autofocuses to anything found
within going from shutter button to
resulting picture is also quite fast a
feat that just adds to the overall
functionality picture quality then is
actually quite good with colors
remaining detailed and not very washed
out as you can see in these pictures
there's a fair enough depth of field
captured using the Xperia v optics that
the pictures get an artistic selective
focused kind of look ultimately this
might be one of the best smartphone
cameras that I have ever worked with to
have this camera pocketed and easily on
hand can make daily random shoots and
even Instagram photos a real treat
and finally we have the software even if
the Xperia v is a little behind in the
Android game with its 4.0.4 Ice Cream
Sandwich Sony has been able to add some
functionality to keep the package fresh
unfortunately it isn't the most unique
looking user interface available nor is
it the most customizable it generally
looks and feels more like vanilla
Android which isn't really in its favor
when you're hoping for a quintessential
Sony experience Sony thankfully added
some functionality underneath that
surface hit the recent apps button and
you will see not only the apps you have
just used but a lot of icons on the
bottom these are the small apps and
while there are more that can be
installed from the Play Store the ones
included give you quick access to a
calendar a timer and a note-taking
overlay that sits above your current
working application this is a welcome
way to get some extra tasks done while
keeping your current one available in
the background the Xperia v is
PlayStation certified but when I
installed the app I found that the
titles most of us might want to play on
this or many of these certified Sony
phones are only available for the Xperia
Play or the PlayStation Vita now there
is some content that you can try out in
the PlayStation mobile store but they
cost a little extra money and current or
even classic Android games will probably
satisfy your gaming needs anyway and now
the part you've all been waiting for the
waterproof test this Xperia Z is
supposed to be able to withstand
immersion in depths between 0 and 100
centimeters but I saw some other users
completely submerging it in cups of
water I decided to take it a step
further by putting it in a filled
fishbowl almost quite miraculously the
phone remained on and even played the
next video in the playlist after my
intro I've left it in for about 10
minutes before taking it out and seeing
if it still worked it indeed did as I
even jumped into fruit ninja and played
a quick round even with the phone still
dripping wet and my fingers damp from
using the phone it was able to register
all of my touches and was working
flawlessly waterproofing might not be
the most practical feature to put on a
smart phone but it will shield your
phone from weather rain the occasional
spill at a restaurant or a bar and is
admittedly a really nice party trick
goes to Sony for doing a great job of
waterproofing that Xperia v
and so there you have it Sony's Xperia v
might not be a top-of-the-line device
but it has features even top-tier
devices which they had expandable memory
a replaceable battery waterproofing and
an exceptionally great camera make this
a more than worthwhile package the
Xperia v is reported to be delayed in
Europe and in some parts of Asia and it
is currently unknown what kind of
release that will see in the United
States if at all preliminary eBay
listings show the phone being sold at
around five hundred US dollars unlocked
I hope that this and more experiences
arrived and become popular in the United
States as it seems Sony still has got
the touch for my full written review
