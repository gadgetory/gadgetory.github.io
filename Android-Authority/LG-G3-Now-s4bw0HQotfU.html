Angela thority and when the LG g3 came
out last year it was instant contender
for phone of the year and for many
reasons but that was then and this is
the LG g3 now over the last couple of
years
LG slowly rose from being somewhat of an
underdog to a top-tier contender and
that became more apparent than ever with
the release of the g3 despite being made
of plastic the design was very appealing
with some unique aspects like the rear
facing buttons and it's still a great
looking phone even with the release of
its successor the g4 and other competing
flagship like the s6 and m9 the back was
also removable which gave access to the
SD card and a swappable battery which is
becoming somewhat of a rarity in 2015
the phone may not feel as high-quality
as a phone made out of metal or glass
but it's still very solidly constructed
the full metal finish also made it feel
and look nicer than most other phones
made out of plastic and prevented it
from being a fingerprint magnet now
depending on how careful you are with
your device it could be showing signs of
wear and tear at this point which mine
certainly has but that can be said about
pretty much any phone really the most
eye-catching part about the g3 design
were these super thin bezels on the
sides and small top and bottom chin that
not only made the phone even more
attractive but also a lot easier to use
in one hand despite having a 5.5 inch
display speaking of the display this
also turned a lot of heads because the
g3 was the first smartphone in the
United States to feature a quad HD
display and during that time it appeared
to be the best display on the market
however as time went on and quad HD
screens became more common it was pretty
clear that the g3 SKU HD screen wasn't
quite ready for primetime that's not to
say that the g3 display is terrible
because it still packs a ton of
sharpness and resolution but in
comparison to the competition that
followed it lacked color and brightness
and didn't really live up to the height
that it had when it first hit the market
as you'd expect with a flagship device
the g3 shipped with the most powerful
processor at the time which was the
snapdragon 801
and three gigabytes of RAM general
performance was pretty good but it
suffered from overheating issues if the
phone was pushed too hard or having the
screen at max brightness which caused
the phone to slow itself down in order
to stay cool now the phone has gone
through several updates including being
updated to lollipop that problem doesn't
seem to persist anymore but there still
is the occasional stutter and dropped
frames and even the most simple tasks
like swiping down the notification shade
it doesn't really ruin the overall
experience and this most likely can be
chalked up to a lack of software
optimization because we all know the
Snapdragon 801 is still a very capable
processor another really big highlight
of the g3 last year was the camera and
even though it didn't offer much in
terms of manual controls it was capable
of taking some really great photos and
was easily one of the best cameras on a
smartphone last year especially because
of a brand new laser-guided autofocus
which made the camera experience very
quick and snappy some of the more recent
flagships out there have come out with
some really impressive cameras including
the brand new g4 but despite that the g3
can still hold its own and make a lot of
people happy
upon release there was a lot of concerns
about the battery life on the g3 despite
packing a really large 3000 milliamp
hour battery and being one of the first
phones with a qHD screen meant that
battery life was going to take a hit and
it certainly did now that's not to say
that the battery life on the g3 is
terrible it basically just sort of
leveled out to being average battery
life and that still pretty much holds
true to this day and for most casual
users this will be perfectly fine but
for those who are demanding some really
crazy high screen on time numbers the g3
may fall a little bit short the software
of the g3 hasn't changed all that much
since its release but it has recently
been updated to lollipop which is great
to see some of the material design
aspects of lollipop have made its way
over to the GUI like the notification
panel and the overview screen but for
the most part it's still the same
experience as it was on KitKat
depending on who you are you may love it
or you may hate it but there's no
denying that the GUI feels bloated
despite some really useful features like
knock
on knock code and dual window LG
software design still pales in
comparison to the rest of the
competition it's certainly usable don't
get me wrong but for those who want a
more streamlined experience you won't
really get that with the g3 all in all
the g3 is still a very solid phone and
it's aged pretty well of the course of
the last year and LG keeping it updated
certainly helps even though the g4 is
getting ready to hit the market and
fixes a lot of the weaknesses of the g3
it obviously isn't going to come without
the flagship price if you're looking for
a phone with a great camera a qHD
display SD card expansion and a
removable battery and you're looking to
save a little bit of money the LG g3
isn't a bad way to go as always guys
