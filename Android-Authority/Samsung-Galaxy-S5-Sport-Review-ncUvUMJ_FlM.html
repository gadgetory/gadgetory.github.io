name is Kevin the tech ninja and today
we're going to do a full review of the
galaxy s5 sport meet Samsung's Galaxy s5
sport available only on Sprint bulky
rubbery and colorful are just a few
adjectives that comes to mind when using
the s5 sport for the first time sure
it's a Galaxy s5 and all the things that
made the s5 vs 5 you can pretty much
find here it's around 10 grams heavier
and it's rugged design style makes it
look a lot bulkier than it truly is the
power button is located on the right
hand side and on the opposite side as
you'd expect you find the volume rocker
albeit the buttons are a bit click here
it's still in the same location the
rubbery feeling of the sport does not
give it a sense of a premium device not
seeing the s5 did but the aesthetics on
the sport takes it down a notch further
the sport comes in a few different
colors the red version that I have is
more of a metallic and burnt red color
which looks pretty good navigation
buttons are one major change that you'll
find on the s5 sport no longer you'll
find the tactile buttons but rather
physical buttons slightly raised and a
carbon fiber type of design the sport
has the same 5.1 ml LED screen that was
found on the s5 which isn't a bad thing
at all it still has a high pixel density
at 432 PPI and the bright and vivid
screen brings in clean and detailed
images texts pop and also video playing
looks great
the blacks are deep and the whites are a
pure white it's not that yellowish color
that you sometimes see on other handsets
Samsung really crafted a fantastic
screen that is actually underrated
doesn't get enough credit sometimes on
the back of the device you'll find a 16
megapixel camera with LED flash the
aperture is at F 2.2 which allows it to
be pretty decent at low-light and it
gives you a really nice depth of field
just like the vanilla s5 the camera and
good lighting is fantastic although in
low lighting and lacks color but still
grabs a better image than most phones
when it comes to video recording you can
record at 4k resolution at 30 frames per
second
the screen isn't for cane but you can
watch it on a 4k display and trust me on
this it looks really really good on the
hardware side of the things you'll find
a decently spec device at this time this
isn't exactly cutting edge as these
specs were announced about six months
ago you'll find the Qualcomm Snapdragon
801 processor which gives you good
performance with excellent battery life
the adrenal 330 GPU which is beefy
enough to run all current Android mobile
games that are out there today and
you'll find two gigabytes of RAM on
board which is pretty much a bare
minimum now to be considered a flagship
phone onboard storage you'll find
sixteen gigabytes but after it's all
said and done after Android TouchWiz and
Sprint takes their share it leaves you
with a measly 10 gigabytes thankfully
you can expand the onboard storage up to
an additional 128 gigabytes with a micro
SD card on the back you'll find a camera
and also a heartrate monitor now one
small change from the s5 to the sport is
that it's using a standard USB port and
not Samsung's newer USB port design not
sure what the true reason is for this
change with any device running a
Snapdragon 801 with 2 gigabytes of RAM
you'd expect the following good battery
life silky smooth performance and fast
multitasking the s5 Sport is no
exception the bare specs of this device
allows it to be a true screamer and
handles most tasks with little issues
even when gaming that utilizes the
adrenal 330 GPU it runs fast the battery
life is what you'd expect from the s5 up
to 21 hours of constant talktime and
after sixteen point two days of full
standby time I received around 18 hours
of moderate use with 2 hours and 30
minutes of screen on time now where the
performance takes a hit it's sadly at
fault of the software
the s5 sport is running android kitkat
as expected
the latest version of TouchWiz is in tow
as well touch with is Samsung skin right
on top of Android it adds tons of new
features like window and window
application s health and power saving
mode Sprint has a huge influence on the
software on the phone and it's evident
the first moment you boot it up the home
screen is cluttered with applications
that provides free trials or links to
the Play Store downloads and you'll find
even more once going into the app drawer
here you'll find about four pages
littered with applications promotions
and other stuff you frankly wouldn't use
even beyond the extra apps there are a
few things that consistently run on the
homescreen Sprint has a floating button
that lets you get into the health
portion of the phone and also a page
turn animation that sits in the top
corner and if you go into this you'll
find additional fitness applications and
other goodies that they provide since
sport is in its name that it's only
proper to mentioning its sporting
features right sure you have the s
health suite that's found on the
standard s5 which is a pedometer it even
lets you track your heart rate with a
monitor that's located on the back what
else does it provide you to help you
with sports stuff within the sports
suite there is little use for most of
the applications and links in there a
lot of these applications are normal
applications you can find the App Store
and a lot of them have some overlapping
features with each other if you're
unsure if this phone is for you then
answer these few questions you want
Samsung's newest phone do you mind that
is thicker than the s5 and does not
provide any additional protection if you
think a phone that's geared to activity
with cool inspiration sayings on the
wallpaper motivate you to workout then
go for but if I need to sum up the s5
sport in one line that is this the s5
sport is a great idea but that was
ruined by carrier with a bad design
here's a few notes that I wanted to add
after the review
I don't want to underestimate the amount
of bloatware was on this device this is
the most bloatware heavy device I ran
into in my whole life now I've used
phones from Verizon from Sprint from 18
CNC mobile now this sprint version of
the galaxy s5 sport has so many
applications it's it dumbfounded me the
amount of applications that it comes
with that are trial applications and
other applications that expire in 30
days or anything like that so I want to
say that first and also I don't want to
underplay the fact that it's still a
galaxy s5 which is still a flagship
device so it does run very well it's a
quick phone it looks good and it's
actually not that heavy but when you
compare it to the galaxy s5 the normal
one I just don't see the big benefit to
the two and plus the s5s four right now
is $100 more than the galaxy s5
