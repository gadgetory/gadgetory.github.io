Authority what's going on everybody and
here we're taking a look at a brand new
smartphone one that you may not have on
your radar but we think that you should
because it is the Marshall London it's
an all new smartphone actually just
launched of just about a week ago and
really we're looking at the design right
here and it just looks really awesome
already if you know anything about
Marshalls amps and speakers I myself
have a Marshall Stanmore in my room then
you know this kind of leather backing
this leather design right here just
looks really great on the smart phone as
it does already on their amps and
everything what's great about this phone
already though is that even though it
might have some mid-range specifications
underneath which we'll get to in a
little bit we do have a removable cover
right here that will allow you and look
at that battery right that looks just
really awesome as a removable battery
and also a microSD card slot so that you
can really enjoy your music all day
every day on the Marshall London again
just the leather look feels really great
there we do have an 8 megapixel camera
on the back and then we do have a
front-facing camera as well but what
you're going to see here are some dual
front-facing speakers above them below
the Marshall logo right here that
provides some really great sound it's
really noisy in this room right now here
at showstoppers iviva so I can't really
have you listen to the actual audio here
but I've tried it out already and it
does steam pretty great
but speaking of dual audio setups if you
go to the top right here we not only
have a button right here that will allow
you to open up your audio audio programs
rather which I'll show you in a little
bit but you can save your rather you can
share sorry you can share your music to
a partner or anybody around you with
these dual setups right here that have
dual output to headphones right there
which is really awesome and even then
talking about the way that Marshall
designs their products we have a volume
rocker right here that is literally a
wheel that's very akin to the way that
Marshall designs all of their
it looks really great it's really lovely
just how nice this phone feels it's at
4.7 inches at a 720p display right here
but obviously the focus is on music now
underneath the surface we have a
Qualcomm Snapdragon processor that is
backed by a dedicated sound card by
serious logic which you may have known
before as wolfson and really what
happens here is when you are able to
open up the music application right here
as I press the button up there you'll be
able to go to this local button right
here and be able to pick either your
local music or you can go to SoundCloud
Spotify or Mixcloud right here with
future applications going to be
available on it as well the music player
itself just kind of taps into all those
services and it will be able to play
music on there you'll also be able to do
some recording on here as well and it
has this nice little design of the app
even has an equaliser here that will
allow you to change from a number of
different number of different equalizer
settings including making your own and
from there you can also have the volume
rocker right here with rather the volume
control right here when you have two
headphones in there you have two
different dials so you can actually
change the volume on one or the other
and then of course Marshall will show
you what's going on in the world of
music according to them it's really just
a nice phone that really takes its own
focus and really makes it as best as it
can and that is music of course with the
dual set up on the top to do a speaker's
on the front and the sound card
underneath this particular phone is not
necessarily available yet in America but
they're hoping that it will be it is
available in Europe right now especially
in the UK and we're really looking
forward so maybe at some point maybe
even even might just myself I would look
to have just a unique phone like this
that not too many people would have out
there because I do love to listen to
everything from music to podcasts and if
you do too this might be the best way
for you to be able to listen to it
because Marshalls at the helm and
they're creating this the London smart
phone keep it tuned to Android or new
for even more about the Marshall smart
phone and beyond that here at Evo we are
in show stoppers at now and we're going
to have even more for you from Ethan
