computational photography a lot of
machine learning and AI to make their
smartphone cameras better and we saw
this in last year's pixel to and pixel
to excel and we're seeing even more of
it this year with the pixel 3 and pixel
3 Excel and there are a handful of new
features in the pixel 3 that make this
camera better than last year's camera so
let's talk about what those features are
how they work and how you can benefit
from them now before I dive into all
these new features you're going to
notice one very common theme among all
of them and it's the fact that they all
require multiple photos and then
leverage machine learning to achieve the
desired result and one of the news
features that Google talked about during
their press event was called top shot
and top shot isn't necessarily new we
actually saw Sony do something very
similar to this with predictive capture
but basically what this does is it will
take a series of photos and then pick a
photo that it thinks looks best and
there's a bunch of different criteria
that it looks for when it does this like
if somebody's blinking or if they're not
looking directly up the camera or if
they're smiling and that's how it goes
about selecting the recommended photo
but you also have the option of picking
any of the other photos that it took if
you want and the other benefit of top
shot is if you don't happen to press the
shutter button at the exact right moment
you might have still captured the moment
that you want it anyways because it is
taking a series of photos instead of
just one the next feature that Google
made a pretty big deal about is called
super resume and super resume is
Google's way of making a 2x zoom without
having a secondary telephoto zoom lens
and super resolume takes advantage of
these small tiny movements in your hand
when you're taking a photo and it'll
take a series of photos all of which are
ever so slightly different and then
merges them down uses machine learning
to create an image that is much more
detailed and a lot sharper when you're
zoomed in versus the standard digital
zoom that you would get on other
smartphone cameras and I think it's
going to be pretty interesting to see
how super resin stacks up to other
smartphones that actually have a
telephoto zoom lens and the cool thing
about super resume is that if you have
it stabilized on something like
a tripod it will still use machine
learning to create and mimic your
natural hand movements in order to
capture more detail when you're zoomed
in so with the pixel 3 and pixel 3 Excel
Google's also adding a new feature
called night sight and night sight at
the time of the recording of this video
isn't available on the pixel 3 just yet
but what this is gonna allow you to do
is take better low-light and nighttime
photography and the way this works is it
sacrifices that 9 frame buffer and that
zero shutter lag and instead will
require you to hold the phone steady
while it takes up to a maximum of 15
frames or 15 photos and then it merges
those photos together to create an image
that has the equivalent of a five-second
exposure and you're probably wondering
if you have to hold the phone steady
well the image come out blurry and
theoretically the answer is no because
Google's merging algorithm is really
smart and it's able to discard anything
that has motion blur or anything that it
doesn't need if there's any unnecessary
movement and you should still get a
photo that is very sharp very detailed
and most importantly very well exposed
the next feature that I want to talk
about is portrait mode and portrait mode
isn't new to the pixel we saw this on
the pixel 2 and pixel to excel but
Google's made one very significant
change on the pixel 3 and pixel 3 excel
that makes portrait mode even better and
without getting into a super long-winded
explanation the pixel 2 used a stereo
pair of images and would leverage the
split pixels from the dual pixel sensor
to create two images that were ever so
slightly different and this was how
Google would mimic the effect of having
two lenses with just one lens and then
it would use those two images to create
a depth map to properly separate the
foreground from the background well with
the pixel 3 Google is using what's
called a learning-based algorithm and
the benefit to this is you're gonna get
much more accurate def mapping and
better separation of the foreground in
the background and also better
background defocusing so let's take a
look at this example for a second the
pixel 2 is on the left and the pixel 3
is on the right and you'll notice right
away that the pixel 3
does a much better job of sensing depth
and how far away the background is from
the foreground whereas the pixel - is
sort of aggressively blurring everything
out as if the background was much
farther away from the subject and some
of the subjects that are relatively on
the same plane as the helmet are also
being blurred out when they really
shouldn't be and if you zoom in and look
at my desk you'll notice a very
aggressive cutoff between in focus and
out of focus on the pixel - whereas on
the pixel 3 the in focus - out of focus
is much more gradual the last feature
that I want to mention is computational
Raw and I don't think this is a feature
that Google actually mentioned during
their press event but the pixel 3 and
pixel 3 excel can take raw photos now
and if you've ever edited photos in a
program like Lightroom or Photoshop
you'll know how much more beneficial
shooting in RAW can be because you can
push the colors a lot more you can push
the highlights and black levels without
the image falling apart like you would
with a compressed JPEG and the way that
it does this is it combines up to 15
images merges them together and this has
a few benefits one you get better
low-light performance 2 you get better
dynamic range and 3 you get an image
that is much closer to what you would
get on a DSLR even though you're working
with a really tiny sensor so this is a
very big deal especially if you take
photography very seriously or you take
smartphone photography very seriously
you're gonna be able to edit these and
make them look however you want and
you're also going to be able to access
them from pretty much anywhere because
it's available on your Google Photos app
