Hindy the Android a 30 out there and
welcome to the 140 ninth edition of
Android apps weekly we did this show a
little bit differently this week because
there is a ton of Pokemon go news and I
know a lot of you don't want to hear it
so we have included a timestamp in the
video description below where you can
click it and skip all of the Pokemon go
content and listen to the rest of the
releases and the headlines from the last
week t-mobile is cashing in on the
Pokemon go crazy by allowing people to
play the game without it affecting their
data cap this is wildly unfair to every
other game out there and I'm sure the
net neutrality conversation will be had
however unless something happens this
promotion will last for about one year
Pokemon go was rolled out to the UK and
Germany this week with other European
and Asian territories planned for the
coming weeks it was also launched in
Italy Spain and Portugal as well that
announcement came on the heels of
Pokemon goes first official updates the
most important part is that the game
gained some much needed stability the
game also became compatible with devices
with Intel chips as well as devices
running Android nougats the stability
still needs some more work but at least
those other problems are taken care of
one of the bigger announcements for
Pokemon go was that it surpassed candy
crush saga as the most popular mobile
game in united states history it reached
21 million active players which soundly
beats the 20 million active users that
candy crush saga achieved this came just
days after it passed tender and active
users and word is that it passed Twitter
as well it was also announced that
Pokemon go players would eventually get
the ability to trade their Pokemon to
other trainers along with that they will
allow sponsored locations of pokey stops
where businesses can buy a pokey stop
and put it in their business you can
take that as either good news or bad
news and that's perfectly fine the CEO
of niantic stated that these updates
would be rolling out soon now for
something a little bit different this
week Pokemon go topped pornography as
the hottest search term in all of the
internet on top of that pokemon porn
searches on pornhub or up a hundred and
thirty-six percent since the game's
launch I'm not overly proud to be a
human being after that second statistic
but hey whatever floats their boat right
of course Pokemon go hasn't been without
a little controversy in its first week
the game accidentally let a woman to a
dead body floating in the river there
have also been reports of
vick accidents traffic and pedestrian
accidents and then there were some
people getting mugged these events are
rare comparatively speaking but it is
yet another reminder to be very careful
when you're out playing and hey if
you're getting a little sick and tired
of hearing about Pokemon go there is a
Chrome extension available now called a
pokemons know it will help by removing
Pokemon go content from your computer
screen at this point I don't blame you
if you're a little sick of hearing about
it and this extension should help ease
the strain of seeing it everywhere okay
now that the Pokemon part is over let's
talk about the other things that
happened this week google launched
google hangouts version 11 this week
included in the massive update is the
additional video messages while the
update also took away the ability to
merge SMS and hangouts threads this is
because they said that the users found
it confusing it isn't a huge deal
overall because SMS is still integrated
and it's rolling out to users right now
it also includes the ability to join a
group chat by sharing a link a new video
came out this week that shows just how
much effort Facebook puts into testing
their application on Android devices the
device forum which is about 200 devices
and swiftly growing test performance on
everything from high-end to low-end
devices as well as older devices it's a
lot of work for an application that uses
so many resources it's been announced
that San Francisco will be hosting the
google play indie games festival on
September 24th the premise is that indie
developers will submit their games to
show off at the festival and the whole
thing will be about the wacky fun and
awesome things that they come up with
we'll cover as much of it as we can when
the time comes Microsoft is working on a
competitor to the popular ifttt this
alternative called cap or conditional
action programmer functions in much the
same way that IFTTT does except it
allows you to start functionality by
using a voice command this would
seemingly let you program your own voice
assistant that does the things that you
want it to do it's not available just
yet but if it's half as cool as it
sounds it's gonna be a lot of fun to use
for even more Android apps and games
news releases and updates don't forget
to check out this week's newsletter
which is linked in the video description
below if you want to sign up for it and
have it sent to your email every Sunday
will have that form for you on the
written companion which is also linked
in the video description below also
don't forget to check out our official
application for even faster news updates
all right folks to take a look at the
apps
games that made a big splash this last
week as usual if you want to check out
any of these apps or games for yourself
you can find those links in the video
description below bit ly one of the
world's most popular link shortening
services has launched its official
application it comes with some gorgeous
material design and mirrors pretty much
all of the functionality from the actual
website you'll be able to shorten links
share those links quickly and check out
the click stats on all of those links
it's an excellent tool with a simple
design that should work for most people
there isn't a lot wrong with it and it's
worth having around at just in case we
fear the walking dead dead run is a
tactical runner where you must run
through hordes of zombies and survive
you can also play as your favorite
characters from the show and
consequently play through some of the
scenes that are actually in the show
itself it's a freemium game looking to
cash in on the walking dead so you can
expect the usual flaws that come with
overproduced freemium games despite that
the game isn't all that bad and it is
free to download to see if you like it
for yourself the parcel track isn't
necessarily brand new but it's actually
really handy the idea is that it lets
you in put all of your tracking numbers
from shipped packages in one single spot
it will then give you updates and alert
you when the delivery status is updated
it supports most known carriers
including UPS usps DHL DHL Express and
FedEx among others you can get
additional features if you go premium
but the free version is pretty good it's
a must try if you get or ship packages
frequently the card wars Kingdom is the
latest game out of Cartoon Network it's
based around the characters of adventure
time and the game is a pretty standard
card collecting experience you'll
collect various characters battle them
and upgrade them to unlock better stats
and abilities there is an online
component as well where you can battle
with other players share your creatures
to other players and borrow helpers from
allies at its core it's not too
different from other card collectors and
that includes the freemium aspect but
it's goofy and fun to play the Discogs
is a unique application that is perfect
for all of you record collectors out
there the idea is that you put your
existing record collection into the
application and then it helps you find
and purchase albums that you don't
currently have along with physical music
discovery and purchasing the application
will also provide an estimated value for
your entire collection if you want
record collecting is niche but virtually
all collectors should definitely try
this one out it also features material
design and no price tag to download
and that about does it for this one
folks if you want to watch more we'll
have joshs unboxing of the Moto Z linked
up there on the screen and in the video
description below don't forget to sign
