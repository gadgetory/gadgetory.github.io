Authority what's going on everybody and
here we're taking a look at the LGV 20
and we're taking a look at some of the
software some of the additions rather
that they put into this new version of
Android nougats yes nougat is the
software you get on here the v20 is
going to be the first phone that gets it
and as you can already see from the home
screens not a whole lot has changed
actually after all this is still LG's UI
and you get some of these stretchy icons
on the home screens very reminiscent of
past versions of the GUI and from there
we do have the app drawer enabled
thankfully but when we first got our
hands on this device it didn't have an
app drawer but it's still available as a
download from the LG smart world
application now looking at the home
screens we do have the ability to change
up the widgets the apps and the
wallpapers of course but that's
something that you probably expected
from there already but there's going to
be a change in the notification
drop-down as it has the sleeker look of
the new get notification drop-down it is
also able to be edited so you can edit
the positioning of all the different
elements and there's plenty of them
inside of the notification drop-down so
there's a lot of options to really work
with we have all of the usual toggles
for settings like Bluetooth Wi-Fi NFC
and all that but we also have this right
here the hi-5 quad DAC now this can only
be toggled if you have headphones or
music playing through the speakers but
mostly for headphones and right next to
it is capture plus capture plus you can
say is the LGV 20s let's say version of
the screen memo from the samsung galaxy
note 7 and of course we don't work with
a stylus here but if we hit capture plus
open still editing and capture plus
you'll be able to take a screenshot of
everything that is currently displaying
and be able to write on it and edit it
in this particular fashion now just have
a little bit of fun here I will go into
the settings and bring up the easter-egg
of course you go to a bat phone head
over to the software info and tap the
Android version of a bunch of times and
you get the Android new get n tap a
bunch of times and hold and you see on
the bottom that a tiny little cat or an
echo rather appears from there we can go
to the notification drop-down
you'll see here that we can edit it and
we have the Easter egg right there I'm
going to drag that to be front and
center or rather the first thing on the
list and right now it is an empty dish
so if I were to tap that I could choose
from these four different icons and be
able to make it say something else so
there I officially have a donut or a
treat rather as that icon there when you
select one of those treats it's like
you're putting it out to attract a cat
and every now and then you will have a
notification that says that a cat is
here and that treat has disappeared and
has been replaced with the empty dish
once again of course one of the main
features of the v10 was its second
screen there's literally a second screen
up here a little area that shows the
time the day and a bunch of
notifications over on the side even when
the main screen is off it's kind of nice
to be able to see all of that but when I
turn on the main screen it goes over to
the signature now this signature can be
shown when the main screen is off you
just have to toggle either the time or
the signature in the settings but when
you swipe here there are a number of
different panels and we have some icons
that can be customized for quick
shortcuts or these quick tools for
turning on things like the flashlight
and then of course the signature here
the signature is the main part that was
addressed in the second screen now you
can put up to 24 digits that can be more
keyed and scrolling so that you have a
nice signature there also the second
screen brightness has been bumped up a
little bit so anyone that was having
issues from the v10 will not have that
with the v20 as everything is nice and
clear to see now one feature about the
signature portion of the second screen
is that it now comes with what's called
the signature wallpaper if I were to
change this here and I keep the same
signature I can hit save and I'll get
this notification that says that the
first character of the signature can be
made into a lockscreen wallpaper now it
only changes the lockscreen wallpaper so
in this case for my signature that says
the next moment it will create a tea
that can be customized in a number of
different ways so if we take a look at
that there's a tea there we can also
have different backgrounds a tea for
that and it's a lowercase T so you can
see how it has
Seraph here on the bottom so we'll go
ahead and pick let's say that one there
and we'll set the wallpaper and on the
lock screen it is definitely the
signature T from there that's pretty
much all that LG put into this version
of Android nougat they actually didn't
put too much of what they have in the
past into this version of Android this
time around which is actually a good
thing it keeps things nice and simple
and with Android nougat at the helm you
can be sure too that a lot of the stock
elements are there which are always easy
on the eyes a few extra features are
available but they are the original
nougat features for example power saving
is not being done by LG anymore and
multi-window now replaces the LG version
of dual window that we had in the G line
before we're really excited to bring you
all of our coverage in the LG v20 so
make sure you stay tuned to android
authority for even more about it and
it's comparisons to plenty of the other
Android smartphones in the market today
