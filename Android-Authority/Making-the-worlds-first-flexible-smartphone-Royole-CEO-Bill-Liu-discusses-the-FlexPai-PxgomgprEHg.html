CES 2019 I have the pleasure of speaking
with the founder Phil lieu of Royale
let's talk about CS 2019 and all the
amazing technology working on this year
we have brought a lot of new products
based on flexible displays and a flash
flow sensors technologists this is all
for you being at CES and every year we
have brought us some new technologies
and products for different industry
applications so this is actually the
flexible display produced from our mass
production line and this is all key
technologies you know you can see that
it's very hybrid so super flexible thin
film and they're actually millions of
devices make micro and nano devices on
top of the super thin flexible film and
the thinnest part could be only like
0.01 minute with a flexible display a
super flexible been able roadable and a
photo voltage as you can see from here
the wind can actually easily blow them
up and down and that was this actually
we also have another technology called a
flexure sensor which means you can
actually manufacture a lot of sensor
device on top of the super thin flexible
film well this way it's also on the
flexible film since it could be also on
the flexible film and now with this you
can sure you use in many different
applications let me give you a few
examples this is a new handbag with a
flex for display and you see that the
flux for display is actually integrated
naturally integrated into the leather
which makes the handbag very different
from the traditional handbag you can
change the image you can change the
video so it's very bad and actually you
can even use the content from your
smartphone to lives for live streaming
to the handbag so here is the first
photo smartphone with flexible display
and it's commercially available already
and so if you go to roil website roy
telecom they're already a lot of people
play praising the order
from our side so here it's actually one
of the phone so as you can see from here
so it's looks like a traditional
smartphone right but difference is you
can't sure you unfold it and then see
this is a pen and then if you fold it up
it's a phone actually compared with two
SIM cards and if you watch movies play
games or you know for yeah for you know
write for documents it's much better
with this big screen so the screen here
is about seven point eight inch and it's
based on our flexible displays and a
flex flexible Sansa technologies it's
actually a lot of the technologies
behind you know we started from ground
it's really a difficulty to make it
happen very challenging make it happen
you got to solve a lot a lot of problems
and challenges from the materials to
process to the device design a circuit
design and a product design it's it's
it's a lot of work you can easily put it
in a pocket at time you know so so this
is the one of the major application for
the flexible display in the consumer
electronics space we actually had a lot
more applications here let me start from
the robotics so we call it a flexible
posture robotics and then you can
actually change the way you design the
robotics here right let's take a look at
this so here you can see the the
robotics was different the have design
face design is surrounded right yeah
make actually this is we have the
flexural center over here so if you
touch this Oh interesting they actually
talked to you and you actually tune the
volume in from here so we have the
sensor here yeah there are a lot of a
sensor interesting you know family yeah
this actually flexible sensor could be
integrated in the leather or into the
cost so you can see them but but but it
was the motive you're right right now
you can see that this is actually you
can play movies you can do many things
and then this is the demo for the
dashboard folder for the vehicles and
also can be used for aircraft this is
all this is all based on the our
flexible displays yeah the cool thing is
like this is a flex for this way it's so
thin it actually gives a lot of weight
okay and the extra helps a lot in the
transportation area because I can save
the fuel and for like people air
probably they actually spend a lot of
time depending the fuel to you know this
in the way all right
exactly and also because the so thin is
so flexible so it's not limited to by
the form factor of the backseat or you
know the wall again it could be
everywhere I'm sure this so this is this
is a like you citizen transparent film
but we have the sensor on top so you can
actually type you get tired easily type
on top you can put it in a pocket
anytime I like it and this is all flex
five you can fold it just like this
perfect this this is actually a computer
you can tapping for office applications
with travel I mean it's so portable and
steers like a traditional computer you
see this this device is called a row
right and it has been on the market a
full year looks like a traditional
notebook right well the cool thing is
you can use traditional paper this is
just the traditional paper and with
traditional peer review and everything
written on the paper it's actually
simultaneously recorded apply the
flexure with sensor out of the paper and
then you can actually sing the content
with the smartphone so actually like we
can save the content just like the video
and you can replay the process</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
