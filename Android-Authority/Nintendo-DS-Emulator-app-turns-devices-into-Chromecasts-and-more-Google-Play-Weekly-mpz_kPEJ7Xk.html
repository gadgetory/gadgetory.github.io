Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Google Play weekly which
will now actually take place every week
on Fridays there's a Nintendo DS
emulator that actually works now an app
that turns your phone into a chromecast
and a whole lot more to talk about this
week so let's get started the first
thing we're going to talk about this
week is knocks knocks is an Android icon
pack and probably one of the biggest
that has ever hit android you may have
seen it floating around social media the
last few days or you may have seen one
of the 10,000 screenshots that people
have uploaded so far and you may be
asking yourself what makes knock so
special as it turns out Knox is pretty
ridiculous it's compatible or at least
partially compatible with just about
every custom launcher out there it's
only other features it comes packed with
1200 icons if you don't know jack about
icons let me let you in on a little
secret 1200 icons is a whole bunch it's
two dollars in the Play Store and if you
use a custom launcher it's worth every
penny a lot of people were aware that
push-to-talk was kind of on its way out
we all thought it was being laid to rest
finally when sprint foot Nextel down
earlier this year however whatsapp is
bringing it back to us 300 million users
and believe it or not it's actually
getting popular again the update should
have rolled out to all major platforms
by now using it is really simple you
just push the microphone button record a
short message and it sends it as soon as
you release the button it's nice and
easy to use and if you are into these
kind of walkie-talkie things it gives
you yet another way to communicate it's
almost football season and gameloft is
celebrating by releasing NFL pro 14 the
latest installment in their NFL pro
series it's not out yet but they have
released a teaser trailer that shows
some of the actual gameplay it's pretty
nice and we're going to take a look at
it right now the graphics look nice and
the gameplay actually looks pretty good
in the truest definition of a teaser it
doesn't explain much if anything there
is a really epic slow-motion field goal
followed by about 40 seconds of players
recovering fumbles and being tackled it
does advertise a new social feature that
uses leaderboards we do hope it's Google
Play games services leaderboards because
well that's what it's there for so who
likes a good shooter I know why do in a
popular shooter called and I'm probably
pronouncing this wrong sine Mora was
released to the google play store
recently it's about time they got it
over there as even Windows Phone got a
port first seriously windows phone but
hey better late than never right the
game is touted for its awesome graphics
and generally fun gameplay the most
unique concept is the absence of player
health instead a timer ticks down and it
goes down faster when you take damage
most people think the storyline kind of
sucks but if you're playing a
shoot-'em-up for the storyline you're
already doing it wrong last on our
docket this week is an update to the
actual google play store it was updated
to version 3.4 point 10 and it did bring
a few changes it's not a huge update
with a bunch of huge changes but we
wouldn't be much of a google play show
if we didn't cover google play updates
the update brought exactly great new
features the first is combined
notifications that puts all the Play
Store activity into one notification
next is a recent app section in your
apps that tells you what apps were you
know recently updated and lastly the buy
in red buttons have been switched again
it's nothing special but it does bring
some new functionality to end the show
we'll take a look at five relatively
newer apps that have begun to make a
splash and get noticed if at any point
you want to check any of these out the
links are in the video description first
up is timely for some reason people are
going absolutely bonkers over this clock
app it has a very nice interface some
unique features like gesture control and
widgets for the homescreen and
lockscreen as well as a daydream add-on
there are n app purchases which seems
just wrong for a clock app but people
still seem to like it also it's referral
code spam campaign will probably get a
little worse before it gets any better
but hey if you're not into watching time
go by you can instead use your android
phone to cast YouTube to your television
an app called cheap cast is out and it
essentially turns your android phone
into a chromecast the drm stuff like
Netflix isn't available yet but if
you're like me and waiting for the
chromecast to get back into stock then
this may help take the pain out of
waiting the speaking of the pain of
waiting the nintendo DS now finally has
a capable emulator on android it's
called drastic DS emulator and it
actually works pretty well it's a little
pricey at around eight dollars us but
sometimes quality costs money and it's
money well spent if you're a
fan of the d/s James are wonderful and
our next appt and I hope I'm getting
this right remmed capsule is probably
one of the most unique ones out there
it's a strategy game that doesn't focus
so much on attack and defense but on
players building the best faces possible
despite its simplistic gameplay and
graphics the game is truly excellent if
you're into strategy you don't want to
miss this one the last in our trending
category this week is an app called spy
camera pro this nifty little camera app
takes pictures and on some devices
records video without it showing up on
your screen much like drinking alcohol
we highly recommend that you use this
app responsibly or not at all in illegal
situations that about wraps it up for
this week once again I'm Joe Hindy the
