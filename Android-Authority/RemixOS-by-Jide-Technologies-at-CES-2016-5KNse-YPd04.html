what's going on everybody and I'm here
with well-tried technology and a look at
their remix OS let me go ahead and get
an introduction from you here and you
can give us a quick rundown on what
remix OS is all about sure well nice to
meet you guys
remakes OS we create it because we
believe in the vision that Android can
do more than just consume content we
believe that Android can help you
produce and create content as well so we
think we are pioneering we believe we
are pioneering the Android PC what we
have back here is a one iteration of
what our vision is this is the remix
mini we ran a Kickstarter campaign in
which it became the number-5 Hardware
project of all time and we actually
fulfilled all the unit's out so all the
backers already and what we see back
here is a touchscreen monitor what you
can do with this is what we think
Android PCs should be all about so this
is a file manager let's look at how we
put your files into different
organizational segments documents
pictures music movies downloads desktop
this is more intuitive than what you see
normally on Android and it's it's
intuitive regardless of what computer
platform you came from before now let's
do something also kind of mind-blowing a
lot of people actually I do wanna stop
you that real quick we're gonna move the
camera over so you can get a closer look
at remix OS alright so we're taking a
look at the interface right now how
exactly is Android being integrated into
this kind of looking desktop right here
right so first of all this is your app
drawer and as you can see the Play Store
in all of the 1.6 million plus apps are
available for download here
now let's move on to the PC side of
things I am in my movies I'm one of the
folders here in my movies folder I gotta
move some of these files over I just did
a drag select in fact I did it kind of
fast let's do it again I'm gonna track
oh I think I just copied it here drag
select here all files and drag and drop
into another folder this is what we
think PC are all about these are the
habits that we carried over from other
platforms so let's do something also
that a lot of people still to on PCs is
watch videos
I mean how more basic than that your
phones your tablet's your PC's or
tops we've always been doing this right
but multitasking is vitally important in
today's day and age a research shows us
that people now spend 31 hours in the 24
hour day doing things think about that
so this is super common when you want to
do things on a computer but then on an
android this is relatively no I'm sorry
it's specifically revolutionary so you
see three windows and three apps open
right now and I'm gonna do something
else this is your word app here and I'm
going to type out a name and I'm gonna
type out maybe here let's do something
really simple drag select again control
cut control paste that was a keyboard
shortcut drag select again right click
on a mouse yes that's right
right click on a mouse on an Android cut
that paste that and then also since it's
Android and this is touchscreen long
press cut that long press paste that why
not I mean this is whatever input method
you're you're wanting to use at the time
it should just work right so this is
what we feel Android PCs are really all
about Oh taking tick in the back end
when are we that back end but taking
what Android is quoting call all about
and just sort of making it into what you
would expect on a PC obviously do you
when you open up things like let's say
games does does it come up like like a
window deep does it come up like a full
full screen or anything so what would
what example would you have here Oh
clash of clans I love it well so clash
of clans comes up as a full scream on on
startup you can also minimize it but
honestly if you're a gaming like clash
of clans boom Beach modern combat 5 I
think this is probably the environment
you want it to be in so Android on a
large screen so usually people
Wi-Fi is really slow at the convention
center but usually people want to play
this on a phone or a tablet and it's
cool but so here we have we have zoom
ability with through the keyboard
shortcut also I actually completely
blanked on how to do it but so this is
what we think gaming could also be
imagine this was on a TV and imagine you
watching you either your favorite videos
or playing your favorite games on a much
larger screen
is one of the benefits of having
something like the remakes many
connected to your TV screen so we got a
look at the large screen a touch screen
even on remix OS but what are we looking
at over here well this is something
we're really excited about we were able
to partner with the android x86 team we
actually flew to taiwan and talk to the
founder himself and he was really
excited to work with us because his
vision was Android being able to run on
intel x86 chips and what we did was we
put Android into a PC environment so
this collaboration worked out really
naturally for us and on the 12th of
January which is next Monday for for our
relative time this is going to be the
the first time you can download remix OS
for PCs for free on wwe.com
so what you see in my hand here and what
you see connected to this think pad here
is the the remix OS for PC put on a USB
Drive and you stick this into a an old
existing or an existing laptop or a
tower PC that might be collecting dust
in your attic or your basement and then
you put it in you boot from the USB and
you probably revive an old useless PC
now for a lot of us that's really cool
that's that's that's something like a
toy for some a really cool product for
others a second PC for another making
sure your PC's aren't going to waste for
other people but we're really targeting
emerging markets here now so let's think
about this scenario you are a person a
student in a classroom sharing maybe two
terminals amongst 30 classmates and
previously these computers were infested
with viruses and malware and over stored
with files so and you can't actually
even locally store as easily as you
would like for these students carrying
around one of these and on their
keychain they could walk up to these
shirts hermanos plug it in and that
would be their desktop save their
homework files locally pull it out go to
their uncle's house maybe an uncle has a
laptop plug it in go and use the same
desktop they had before go
to their local library the community
center pull it into another terminal and
get the same desktop they had before all
the apps they downloaded all the data
they stored right is right there this
could potentially be a life changing
device for them because access
information is really the key to
knowledge and transfer transformative
powers for yourself to change your lives
your family's lives and in that little
corner of the world right so this is
what we're really excited about we we
really started this company with a
mission to use what we could do with
technology to positively affect as many
lives as possible in the world and so
this is as close to realizing that as
possible this is an alpha release on the
12th we hope that the users who download
it and test it out for us give us a lot
of feedback especially critical feedback
obviously when it comes to iterations of
Android we have let's call them growing
pains
are there any applications or are there
any let's say hurdles that you've had to
go through already with this alpha
release of remix OS unlik split this way
I'll do any applications that when we
try to load it it's gonna have a lot of
problems if you follow Google
development best practices actually on
remix OS if they run perfectly fine if
you deviate from this protocol the more
you deviate the more bugs we have to
actually kill and work on through our
engineering teams but three things
yeah but three things to keep in mind on
remix OS I might be different from other
versions of Android or human Android
itself one we are gonna put you in
multiple windows we are going to put you
in resizable windows and we are going to
allow keyboard shortcuts and mouse
right-click menus to function across the
board on remix OS including potentially
your app so for developers we have a
community board and we've actually put
up some links to where Google actually
gives you good best practices for
supporting these types of environments
so I'm happy to share these links you
can find it at judo comm and if you're a
developer out there thinking about what
can I do to my app to make it compatible
with remakes OS just remember if the
closer you follow Android development
best practices you don't have to do
anything special
as far as performance goes cuz we did
see you know clash of clans you saw it
in the clip there
it ran wonderfully like it looked like
it was gonna be a really fun time to
play even on a mouse and keyboard but in
the case of the touchscreen over here
that was gonna be gangbusters it's gonna
be really fun to play but as far as
performance goes you're piggybacking off
of the the computer that it's already
being plugged into right
are there any specifications that the
users might need to know in order to
have the full experience of remix OS
nice for the x86 or the remakes OS for
PCs an interesting thing is if you if
you check out a lot of bench bench
benchmark scores right the highest the
highest score right now is a Samsung
device I don't remember which one if you
stick it into an Intel chipset it
actually kind of doubles that score so
performance wise you're not gonna be
running into any really serious problems
in fact you're probably running it into
a bit much faster or smoother experience
with Android so it is an alpha release
what we're asking the early downloaders
and users to do is give us a lot of
feedback let us know what's wrong with
it let us know what you'd like to have
better function on it and we'll work we
again we average updates every two weeks
and rpms work really hard we give them
all this feedback they actually funnel
into actionable items for our software
engineering teams to work on and you
know this is what we're all about we
want to grow this with a community
because without you guys actually we
can't compete in this market so many
Fortune 500 companies live in our space
and we can only do it in ch mod and wild
deep mile deep we need you guys the inch
and we need to work with you guys multi
engage what you guys learn with you guys
communicate with you guys and through
that that's the only way we can survive
and maybe thrive in this market aside
from our already good looking and really
cool products it's that kind of reaching
out to the public and reaching out to
guys like you is the reason why we
really need to see remix OS here at
showstoppers at CES 2016 so we want to
thank you man give them your name one
more time my name is Jason this is jawed
and we're really excited to be here at
CES Jason thank you so much man and a
great look at remix OS make sure you
stay tuned for even more from CES 20
sixteen and you might see even more from
remix OS because we might be visiting
them or they might be visiting us at our
booth also that's true looking forward
to it man
alright signing off here at showstoppers
at CES 2016</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
