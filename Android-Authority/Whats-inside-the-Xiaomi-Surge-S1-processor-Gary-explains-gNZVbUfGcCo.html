authority now we're all fairly used to
new mobile processes being lost on a
regular basis maybe a new processor from
coal quorum a new processor from Samsung
and that's pretty good and we like to
look at them and see what improved see
what direction mobile processing
technology is taking but it's much rarer
that we have a whole new company that
starts making mobile processors and
that's what we have with the shell
research s1 early this year shall we
launch a new stone the Xiaomi new 5c and
rather than using a Qualcomm processor
or a mediatek processor it uses shammies
own processor the Serge s1 so the
question before us today is is what's
inside the Serge s1 well let me explain
so if you think about it there are
basically four main mobile processor
makers in the world today
you've got Qualcomm with a successful
Snapdragon processors you've got media
tech which take up a lot of the
mid-range processors and are very
successful in Asia and then Samsung make
their own chips for its phones and while
we make its own chips to Curie range for
its phones now basically if you're not
Samsung and you're not while way and you
want to build a phone you have to go to
basically call corn or to mediatek to
get your mobile processor well that was
the case also with Xiaomi all of the
phones that shall we have made have been
predominantly using Qualcomm chips
occasionally they also use media tip
chips but back in 2014
Charlie decides to start designing its
own mobile processor so it didn't have
to buy from Qualcomm it didn't have to
buy from MediaTek it would use its own
in-house technology so basically it what
is it with an octa-core processor that
uses eight cortex a53 cause now the
court is a53 is one of the world's most
popular 64-bit calls now when you find
in an octa-core configuration what you
basically have is four cores that are
clocked to the higher frequency in this
case at 2.2 gigahertz and then you have
four cores that are clocked at a lower
frequency in this case 1.4 gigahertz now
call
in SOC there's not just CPU core there's
a whole bunch of other stuff and more
importantly there is also a GPU and the
GPU the graphics processing unit inside
of the Serge s1 is the arm ret 860 MP
for now the MP form part means it's a
quad core it's got four shader cores
inside of it which is actually very good
for this mid-range target for example if
you look at the p10 light while a p10
light which I reviewed recently that has
the killing six five eight in it and
that only has a 2-quart
GPU setup inside of it and when shall we
talked about the Serge s1 they mentioned
in several of their slides that it uses
a technology called a MBC arm frame
buffer compression now what's quite
interesting and it this little bit of a
revelation to me when I found that a
couple of years ago one of the most
expensive things to do inside of a
mobile processor in terms of the energy
it uses is shuffling around data so if
you think about it you've got a game
running at 60 frames a second well 60
times a second a full HD frame needs to
get passed from the GPU to the display
driver maybe you're decoding a video
like from usually needs to go from the
video decoder often display driver for
all this sending around these 60 frames
a second full HD consumes a lot of
battery power so arm come up with a
system called the arm frame buffer
compression which basically compresses
the data internally inside of a chip so
that when it's pushing this data from
one place to another it's doing it in a
compressed form which means there's less
data to move and in fact it turns out
that compressing it and then sending it
is actually more efficient than just
sending it full frame evenly you're
spending time compressing that data now
when you look at the block diagram that
shall be presented at the launch of the
Serge s1 it says very clearly the arm
frame buffer compression technology is
covering the GPU the video processor and
the display process but I got thinking
if it's supporting the arm frame buffer
compression technology maybe they are
Majerle components in there now there
are lots of programs you can download
from the Play Store that give you kind
of system information it digs around
deep inside of Android to kind of find
out what are the
different hardware components that exist
inside of the phone now I downloading
one of those aida64 is on I use I
started to go through to see what we
could finally yes there's the cortex a53
octa-core processor yes there's a Mali T
860 MP for GPU but if you then look in
the section of that program at what
codecs are being used that's the
encoders decoders of video you find that
it talks about the V 500 decoders now
basically if this is using a Marley V
500 video process that it needs to have
the relevant software drivers turn
drivers from the windows era to power
that hardware and that's exactly what it
has so from this we can conclude the
video decoder and the video encoder is
actually the Molly V 500 so now we have
the arm CPU we have the arm GPU and now
we have the arm video decoder so it
would make sense they also use a display
processor arm now further digging around
inside of a DES didn't reveal that
technology but if you can actually use
the Android debugging bridge and connect
to the file system that on the
smartphone you actually I start having a
look around Alyssa he looked at a place
called the flash proc filing system and
it contains a little image of really
interesting information when I was
rooting around inside of there I was
discovered that the display processor is
in fact the Molly DP 550 so what that
means for us as consumers is that we
know that the software stack that's
included in the surge s1 is actually
optimized by arm themselves they don't
think for a moment that means that shall
we didn't do anything just kind of grab
component and boom with no no building a
mobile is way
poor complicating that and there's a
whole load of stuff in there that shall
we did themselves but by using these
technologies from people who are experts
in these fields Xiaomi were able to
bring it together easily and quickly and
most important cost effectively so it
could launch its own mobile processor so
of course it I actually have the me 5c
here I couldn't resist some benchmarking
so let's see how Charlie's new process
stacks up against the competition now to
some three phones that are comparative
with comparative mobile processors to
the show me me 5c I've first of all
tainted with the Huawei p10 right and
that's got the killing 65 8 in it I've
also had a look at the Oppo f1 plus
which has got a mediatek processor in it
and I'm also looking at the Huawei Nova
which has a snapdragon 6 2 5 in it now
they're all octa-core cortex a53
processors with Marley T 800 series
processors in them except of course for
the Qualcomm which is got the Adreno in
it so let's start with the graphics
benchmarking here we see for 3dmark
sling shot extreme the Serge s1 is the
clear winner with 681 while the other
devices are down in the 400s and 300s
if we look at GFX bench Manhattan we can
see the Serge s1 has the highest frame
rate 8.4 frames a second which is not
very high of course compared to the
flagship phones but this is a mid-range
phone and it does much better than the
queuing 65 8 the Snapdragon 62 5 and the
mediatek p10 so we can see that having
that four core GPU in there has made a
big difference in terms of its graphics
performance compared to the other
processors now how does it stack up for
just CPU related work well interesting
that it didn't do as well as I expected
so if we take antutu to start with it
doesn't come in first place the first
place actually goes to the Snapdragon
625 with a score of 60 4279 however it's
not too far behind it is in third place
with 60,000 hundred and twenty one and
in fact when you go over to Geekbench
single score you see the same story here
repeated the quirian 65 eight and this
take time takes the crown the Snapdragon
62 5 comes in second and the surges one
does come in third only just beating the
Helio p10 so on the CPU part of the
surge s1 looks good on paper it hasn't
necessarily translated through to the
benchmarks
however just one more redeeming
benchmark if we look at Geekbench 4 for
the multi-core test the Serge s1 does in
fact come
on top place with 3,000 379 the closest
competitor being the keyring six five
eight we 3310 and then after that you
get the snapdragon six to five now the
rumor is that shall me aren't just
stopping with the surges one they
working on the surge s2 but this won't
be a follow-up to the surges one in
terms of it we a mid-range process
they're going to go for flagship in
high-end processors and the room is
going to have a quartic a seventy three
core probably four point is a seventy
three together with four cortex a53 it
probably can have a Mali GPU again my
guess would be maybe the model eg
seventy one and if they also follow the
same pattern it's going to have a
modeling video decoder it probably the
Mali be 550 and it's also going to have
a money to spray process run it properly
the Mali a DP 650 so person I'm really
excited about this to see Xiaomi
breaking into this high-end where people
like Samsung Qualcomm and a while we
have really dominated and actually
showing there's still room for
competition and for people to make new
flagship processors so to wrap up then
we basically know that the Xiaomi s1 is
Shanley's first generation mobile
processor they've gone for the mid-range
with the octa-core err a cortex a53 it's
got a Mali GPU in it which is very good
in terms of it's got four cores
it's also got a Mali video decoder sort
of got a multi display processor and
it's going to be really interesting to
see whether the disruptive business
nature of sharmee what they've done in
Asia particularly whether that can be
copied through carry through with their
mobile processors and maybe in a couple
of years time we're going to be talking
not just about pork or mediatek Huawei
and Samsung's but we're also going to
looking around shammies processes and
the impact they're having on the
worldwide market I'm going to soon from
