android authority reporting live from
CES 2015 I have the pleasure of meeting
with Chris Walker who's general manager
of tablets at Intel and today we're
going to ask them some tough questions
now just joking and just get a general
address thanks for taking the time with
it what do we what are we looking at for
from Intel in 2015 we're really excited
to know in 20 2015 we really want to
we're building on a big step up in the
market that we made in 2014 both on
volume in our in our partnerships so as
we grow in 15 I think you're going to
see us evolve the way we think the
Android the tablet mark is evolving to a
lot more new usages new specialization
and devices to meet how people are
integrating tablets in their life beyond
the media consumption of the past and so
we've got some different devices here
but they're all marked by an underlying
thing of using our atom processor being
really fast for that kind of browsing
and media experience you want but it's
now starting to focus on you see some
great new innovations in form factor in
usages and the quality levels at some
really really attractive price points
very nice yeah I mean so I'm just
curious to know what Intel is doing from
a developer standpoint because in the
past there's been a couple of criticisms
with regards to battery life in some
cases with graphically intensive games
some of the performance hiccups like
what are you doing to kind of cultivate
up following enough to achieve critical
mass so that everything is optimized for
all Intel referenced as well as an
example in terms of critical mass we
took a very big big goal in 2014 in
terms of growing our growing or volume a
lot of that was was with with Android
and if you look at I can only
through q3 through third-party reporting
we became the number one merchant
supplier of processors and tablets so
are our step function of volume happened
in 14 and now we're growing with the
market in usages of bringing that
quality level so i'll give you give you
a couple examples one is this this trek
sur device that was released in europe
and this is one of the first devices
that came through our Intel reference
device program with Android so this was
a nap this was this is 120 euros which
is a very you know about 120 US dollars
once you figure bad exaggerated but so
really nice really nice build quality
you can feel how I saw this now that was
released in November and within two
weeks of Google releasing lollipop yeah
that device was upgraded to the user
over the over the air so that's you know
us keeping pace and partnering with
Google and OEM device makers to bring
that always fresh Android experience to
the user the other end of the spectrum
is what did with Dell in the end of it
in the venue of venue 8 this is a
world's thinnest tablet at six
millimeter beautiful bright edge it said
edge screen and that's got the again
great performance all-day battery life
android device but then we did this is
one of the first implementations of our
real sense in this case it's got a 3d
snapshot camera so when you take a take
a picture it captures the whole field of
depth it allows you to do things like
apply filters at any part of the the
image right on the tablet right and go
share that immediately you're not having
to go out into another post processing
on something else so looking towards
2015 it seems like we almost have to
kind of a convergence in the sense that
users are expecting the level of
performance that they've had with their
x86 pcs or Macs for long
and now the performance on our mobile
devices is getting just better and
better so in terms of 64 bid and where
we're going in if you just elaborate a
little bit on what intel has in store as
things grow in both screen size in usage
we think people will be able to utilize
our 64-bit performance the optimizations
that we're doing working with is vs so
we continue to grow on that but then
bring new usages new usages to the to
the device like things like the
realsense camera like our context
sensors to be able to take the hard
things of halite excel acceleration
things like that combine it and allow
software vendors to take in soft context
like my calendar things like that so now
if I'm playing one of those new rich
games it knows that I'm outside don't
push in-app buys to me because it knows
the context of which which I'm playing
or don't give them my ingame alerts
because I'm in animated or you know my
student i'm in class do you feel as
though you know the current trajectory
being more of a company that is
completely under dependent of all the
engineering manufacturing and working
with your partners is it enough to be a
competitive technological differentiator
in the future versus a more of an open
you know company like arm well well
first I'd say that as an integrated
device manufacturer we take that that
SOC and platform approach it's across
hardware software our silicon designers
can sit with our technology the people
developing the process technology not to
optimize I tale we think that gives us a
real advantage in the market as we
continue to push push with Moore's law
the other thing is in terms of openness
is uh we embrace in our platform runs
both both Android or if you know the OEM
wants they can image
windows on on the same same piece of
hardware to help their flexibility on
how they build and deliver whichever
ecosystem their their customers want I'd
say third is you know we've got a long
history of being a port of choice in
working with ISVs across windows android
linux and things like i said about the
unity partnership things that we see in
commercial android tablets people are
able to target and take advantage of our
developer tools are rich software
developer programs and support to bring
their applications to life on our in our
partners hardware so and we take it and
we have you know a p is for things like
our context contact sensors so i think
we're in a great position to leverage
the rich history we've got of openness
and broad ecosystem support both
hardware and software to develop better
and better android usages that was a
really good response everyone knows that
Intel makes some of the finest
processors in the world and you know
we're really excited to see what's
coming in terms of a lot of the
convertibles you know I mean it's never
been a better time to be a fan of
technology and we know you guys are a
big part of it so I want to say a huge
thanks for your time and oh thank you
thank you for time with us and you know
on behalf of you know all the engineers
at edit in the factory people you want
to thank your audience for you spending
the time with us here and we'll hearing
what we've got we've got to do and we've
got a lot a lot of neat things come in
15 should we go to a DF this area think
you should absolutely be at IDF this
year
it well it starts to look away from
android authority at CES 2015 with intel
thank you very much guys stay tuned for
more great coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
