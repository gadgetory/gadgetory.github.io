to Shanghai Shanghai being one of the
epicenters of Chinese Commerce seemed
like the appropriate backdrop for what
would be the headquarters of Huawei now
it is important to note that this is the
headquarters not the campus of Huawei
like in Shenzhen so it had a very
different look to it but nonetheless we
dove into what looked like a very
corporate and very fancy building in
order to get even more time with
huawei's representatives for some
interviews and also a look at their
headquarters not only at the end
experience on which you'll see a little
bit later but actually also to their R&amp;amp;D
area which unfortunately we are unable
to show you because it was one of the
few places of the tour that we were
unable to record get audio or even
really talked about that much but it was
a pretty interesting time to take a look
at how their R&amp;amp;D puts together their
devices but first we have interviews if
it took if we talk about small phone
surely we think about several scenes
maybe first is a camera
what's a camera how about timer it is
and secondly the what's the feeling you
hold it we hold it
and the third is how about screen it
looks maybe good or not you can separate
with UI so and of course there are some
additional feature maybe new feature to
give the different appearance to
consumer such as fingerprint such as
some sensor to test your heartbeat oh
something hot right a pressure or
something yeah so I think the in the in
this year we invest all of this area in
our Rd and with that we geared up for
yet another portion of our tour now I
already told you that we are not able to
record or even take any sound or even
talk about the R&amp;amp;D area the testing area
for devices but we can't show you the
experience centre which is another area
that while we put together to show not
only what they can do with current
technology but what they hope to do with
the future of what they call mbb which
is mobile or
banned their own solutions for mobile
broadband will allow for the creation of
5g internet less we saw here and like I
mentioned in the previous video is all
about the Internet of Things being able
to create hot spots in all parts of what
they call the tech city in order to
create a network that can control not
only the network that goes to your phone
but a network that includes everything
from regulators across the city to the
smartphone in your hand to even medical
devices across the board many
presentations that were available
focused on the 5g service and one that
Huawei hopes to be a pioneer of in the
near future and through 5g Internet we
will be able to not only like in the
previous video see 4k video become a
real streaming service with all of those
packets coming through beautifully in
the broadband but also see a particular
future where we have access points not
only in the places that we expect them
to be a but in places that we don't as
you can see here we have a demonstration
of a mobile broadband repeater that
would be able to allow everyone to
seamlessly go from network to network in
order to keep their eyes on the media
that they might be streaming for example
but then that is of course for the
future and Huawei was quick to show us a
particular presentation showing that in
recent events that held a lot of people
in particular stadiums they were still
able with their access points to allow
everyone in attendance to be able to
access the Internet seamlessly to do
things like post to youtube or an
Instagram and with that we left the
experience center and came back with a
couple more interviews to round off the
day because of course market is very
important market for us and yesterday I
just saw a interview from huawei sales
VP and he mentioned that far away were
entered the US market because this is
inevitable so we need to do a lot of
things and we need to adopt a strategy
to enter the US market I think you know
qHD will consume more power but that is
only one part of the impact they also
impact other things for example the
contrast ratio and the color saturation
ratio and with the same technology if we
pursue UHD that means we have to improve
the
likeness we have to put in more back
Lighting's that will also consume more
power
I'm not saying we'll already rule out
the chance of adopting qHD when we solve
the power consumption issue color
saturation and a contrast ratio issue
when those issues are all soft well of
course we'll adopt a qHD and with that
we ended our tour with huawei first they
brought us out to Shenzhen and then we
went to Shanghai to their headquarters
where we were able to get a much better
look at their device testing but it's
not something that we were able to talk
about or even record at the time
nonetheless one thing became clear to us
huawei not only has a very big pedigree
when it comes to telecommunications and
that is the reason why they have a lot
of prowess in the smartphone game but
they do have a lot of big plans for the
upcoming few years not only with their
smartphones but with the possibility of
mobile network evolution from there
though we were able to get some
interviews and a couple of them are
going to be made available in shortened
forms from the one hour long interviews
we were able to have with the high-level
representatives at Huawei we want to
give while we our thanks for inviting us
to come out to Shenzhen and Shanghai and
we hope that later this year we will be
able to do even more media tours like
this with other companies as well so
keep it tuned to Android authority for
all of that gray coverage including the
upcoming interviews and my full review
of the honor 6 plus of which Huawei has
released very recently so keep it tuned
here and remember to drop us some likes
