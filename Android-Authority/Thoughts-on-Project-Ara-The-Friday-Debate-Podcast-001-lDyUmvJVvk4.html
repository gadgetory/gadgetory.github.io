Friday debate podcast by android
authority discussing topics and android
every week this week we have our first
ever episode so if you are one of our
first listeners on this podcast thank
you so much for listening and I want to
extend a quick thanks to our guests here
I am of course Joshua Vergara from
android authority what's going on
everybody and i am your host every
single week as we take a topic that we
otherwise have on the android authority
calm website for the friday debate and
we talk its ears off or as i said in our
description for our pilot episode if you
have hopefully enjoyed it we beat the
proverbial dead horse on this topic but
nonetheless welcome to all of you who
are here and before we even get started
I want to go down the line and introduce
our great gifts for this week I'm going
to go ahead and name off the three
people we have on the panel this week
we'll start off with our lead editor
andrew grush hey everyone the name is
andrew grush or for those here at team
eh eh i'm actually better known as
krushi some of you may already be
familiar with my riding on android
authority i was also on last week's
pilot for those who watched it for those
new to the show I'm the u.s. senior
editor like Josh mentioned basically
that means I do a combination of writing
editing and I help with the day-to-day
management of the website I've been with
android authority for about two and a
half years now and this is absolutely
the best job I've ever had in my life
nice and i like i also put in the
description from the pilot episode from
CES 2015 grush is also the architect of
the friday debate topic that you may be
reading on our website so the topics
that are occurring not only the website
but in the friday debate podcast itself
are going to be the work of brush and on
some level me but also the rest of our
team looking for a great topic to bring
to you guys let's go ahead and move on
over to another writer from our team
Jonathan Feist well hello thank you
how's everybody doing again Jonathan
Feist and one of the writers with a team
here corsa we cover all the news
coverage I've got the evening shift so
you'll see me you know first thing in
the morning if in that UK or Asia and
you know middle of the night if here in
the United States
now one of my favorite things around
here is every thursday i do an android
customization post not just a little bit
of you know tidbits tips and tricks on
how to customize your device and you
know so far we've been avoiding the root
topics but roots coming up soon stay
tuned very nice and also jonathan has a
what's the term I'm looking for here i
am not a pet name but we have a nice
little name that we have for him last
name Feist so we call them feisty also
so and now and then of course we have
one of our youtubers our appt guy on
over here Joseph Hindi hey everybody I'm
Joe Hindy the the android authority app
guy I am also the apps editor / android
authority i do all the app lists and app
reviews and video game reviews um like
grow she said man this is the best job
ever because i literally get paid to
play video games and i know a lot of
people are envious about that and a fun
little fun fact here with this i will
have co-hosted or been a guest on every
single android authority weekly show and
I remain the only youtuber to do that so
no super happy to be here oh nice as
well it's really great to have you guys
on here by the way I was about to say
having John here is going to be really
awesome we're gonna have probably this
particular group on most weeks but we
will have some roving guests in and out
well as time goes on but nonetheless we
are here on our first episode and I'm
really happy to have Joe here cuz he and
i actually have done a lot of YouTube
videos together where typically want to
have to do the editing for I have to
have that bleep button ready from time
to time but nonetheless we are of course
here at the Friday debate and let's go
ahead and jump into our topic let's not
even waste any time here is what grush
had for this week's Friday debate topic
that you will be able to read today on
Friday of course and it has to do with
project ara with aura the project are
that is expected to arrive in Puerto
Rico in a pilot program later this year
ara is finally almost ready for prime
time or is it do we think that modular
phones can find success in the market I
think that's where most of our
discussion is going to come from but if
it isn't ready for the market to find
success what will hold it back alright
so what we're looking at here is
basically a phone that you can put
together on the fly and you can take out
parts you can put parts back into it and
it's a different take on what a smart
phone can be very very uh very similar
to what a computer can be but it's
starting off in Puerto Rico and I know
Andrew already said that he had a couple
of pieces of information about why
Puerto Rico was that place sure okay so
uh really puerto rico might seem odd
choice at first but the biggest thing is
it's a u.s. territory so that means it's
the perfect test market because you know
it's still under the FCC got you know
regulations and stuff and so that means
that they can kind of prepare it for the
US market in a limited setting and
beyond that actually Puerto Rico was a
mobile-first nation meaning that the
majority of people are using smartphones
to get onto the internet and so that
makes it you know a prime target and you
know it's because of the way Puerto Rico
set up they're actually going to be
delivering parts instead of having up
online channel initially they're going
to deliver it through food trucks
actually they're gonna have a set of
food trucks they can go around and let
people try out the products hands on and
then buy products and heck they're going
to have 3d printers in the back so they
can be able to customize it on the fly
and Puerto Rico just really works out
well for that not to mention Puerto Rico
has really good relationships as far as
with shipping across the world so
modular developers from all over are
gonna be able to easily get parts there
and so that's kind of the reason why
they chose Puerto Rico it might sound
like an odd choice but it makes sense No
okay well food trucks nice is it Wow are
you gonna be able get food with them or
is it literally know that well obviously
they're not really food trucks but you
know the you know the style of food
trucks that you have in that you know
those countries where they come you know
it's gonna be one of those basically
except for its gonna be technology mmm
okay well yeah Puerto Rico does make
quite a bit of sense but let's go ahead
and get into our actual discussion
modular phones and specifically a
project ara let's start off with Joe
over there let's see what you have to
say about modular phones and what it
might mean for the smartphone industry
um when I think of like modular phones I
think of like desktop PCs like what
desktop PCs are to computing is
essentially what i think project are
would be to smartphones where like
people you know it's like I don't think
is going to be super popular I think it
might hit the mainstream
I don't think it's going to have the
kind of growth that we see with things
like you know oh I'm sorry I'm blanking
here it's a midnight where I am so I'm a
little blank right now but uh am I still
if I stone the call ya know you're here
alright cool makeup sharing it's like
everything blanked out for a sec sorry
um but no I think it's gonna be
something like desktop computers where
you know that the people who are going
to use project ara are people who are
tinker's you know people who really want
something more powerful something
upgradable you know something that they
can keep around for years and years and
years as opposed to you know most people
who are going to upgrade every couple of
years like they do with their laptops um
I do think the thing that's going to
hold it back though is Android as in
like the operating system because in
most cases Android is made for the
specific phone that it runs on at like
at a kernel level like all the drivers
the camera drivers the you know the CPU
stuff and all that stuff is made
specifically for that one android device
and if they want ora to you know to be
something that people keep for years and
years and years they're gonna have to
start coming out with like a version of
Android that's like a desktop operating
system that has all of those drivers
already there and they can just install
it on anything and so I think that's the
that's gonna be the big thing for for it
that's you know I might be way off base
I'm not a one hundred percent certain on
that but well I was gonna I was going to
put out this notion like it doesn't the
ecosystem sort of already allow for sort
of the in and outs of an operating
system along with the processor because
we have processors like the Snapdragon
series that can be outfitted with every
single band and it also would be able to
take on pretty much any Android
iteration if as long as we don't use
particular types of processors that
require a very specific type of kernels
of you think that maybe just having the
Qualcomm basis enough be enough for
Android to really survive on this
project or ecosystem oh no definitely
like we're heading in that direction
already you know with the like you said
with the Qualcomm processors that have
all of the all the various radio bands
built into it but you know I we were
talking about it before the show you
like a in the chats about how you know
like there's gonna be the k1 the k1
processor for project are right
so yes so we have Nvidia's k 1 and then
Snapdragon and you know that it requires
two different sets of you know two
different sets of software so you know
in order to switch one out and put one
in you know it would essentially require
someone to reinstall Android unless
Android were able you know to be run on
both you know no matter which one you
installed it on it would still work just
fine kind of like you know how you do
with Windows now where you can install
it on AMD or intel it doesn't matter
because you know the basic code is there
for both of them and I think that's
something that androids going to have to
do with so many different you know
especially with stuff like cameras and
then you know that at least two
different kinds of processors and you
all the various hardware that goes into
these things you know it's going to have
to come to that point where it's going
to be like installing a desktop OS where
it doesn't matter what's in project aura
it's still gonna boot and still gonna
run yeah and I think that's going to be
the you know the biggest hurdle although
you know if it's getting this close to
being released it's probably something
they've already been working on anyway
yeah they have okay yeah how about you
go she went well how do you how do you
feel about maybe one day using a phone
that is a a conglomeration of pieces
well as a computer nerd who still builds
own you know pc rigs i absolutely love
the idea but first i kind of want to
address that some of the things that
that joe said first of all yes i can see
it being appealing to the pc type you
know who likes to build their own stuff
but actually that's not what Google is
really going for ideally if you look at
like the website and stuff they keep
talking about how it's they want to use
it to reach you know the next five
billion let's a big mantra and the idea
is that you know someone who doesn't
have a lot of money could you know by
the base unit for around fifty bucks and
then it would basically just come with a
basic processor a screen that would be
low res and just everything needed to
get started and then as I saved up money
they could slowly but surely add on
things and that's they're actually
probably marketing more towards emerging
markets initially not and so that's you
know and I'm not sure how much success
will find them that it really comes down
to how easy they make it and actually
that leads to something else he was
talking about it comes down to Android
because even with Windows you know you
have to if you
in a new part you know you have to still
there's driver issues there's
installation issues sometimes you run
into trouble shooting is Android gonna
be able to adjust to that well enough
and you know they are working on it they
have a special version of Android L they
using is the basis that allows for hot
swapping of parts but I'm just not sure
if Android is designed to handle this
and I'm sure they're thinking about that
but so basically what I'm saying is that
that the aim that they're going for is
the emerging markets and I'm just not
sure if it's going to hit there but I do
think it has some potential for the nerd
types you know it's just it comes down
to logistics i'm not sure if they can
pull off you know making the android
work well enough for this kind of you
know platform well i mean that emerging
markets comment is really interesting
we're going to come back to that but i
do want to get feisty as thoughts on
project ara in general what do you think
this particular ecosystem might have to
offer us jumping off of what the other
guys have said already that you know
exactly what the operating system and
Android itself being the limitation of
course Google's look keeping tabs on
everything and it looks like they're
going to control all of the parts
through possibly the Play Store another
outlet like that so I'm not so much
worried about that you know the custom
OS the version of l like you were saying
that would pull it all together but i
think the real key thing here that will
make or break project ara is the hot
swap ability obviously it's going to
have it which is a positive without it i
cannot imagine people wanting to shut
down their device each time so that they
can swap a piece and and move forward
that hot swap ability will be a key
factor and you know that the tech crowd
that's interested in this device that i
think is going to be pretty much the
same crowd as you know those interested
in the raspberry pi device and the
arduino kits and you know those things
are great devices there a ton of fun but
i really think they're limited in scope
it's not not exactly a general public
that's going out and buying those things
so i have my concerns over ara
yeah I think I might agree with you John
because I think one of the one of the
main aspects of the whole modular phone
type deal is that well I mean
customization is going to be very big
for this particular device and like
people have been reporting on already
the whole customization process for it
kind of takes on a moto maker feel and
that's kind of great because moto maker
really made the Moto X one of the best
phones over the last couple of years but
the problem with making it into a
modular sense is that well who knows
what type of modules were going to even
have in order to create the phone that
we want and who knows what will happen
when third parties kind of get in on
this well everything come from just one
manufacturer and even then what modules
are going to be made available because
from from what we've already seen so far
in these prototypes is that we have
things like the Tegra k1 which actually
sounds pretty awesome even though the x1
was just was just announced and that
would be even better but we have 720p
displays in one night and coming off of
Andrews side of things I do think that
it will become a nice emerging market
product but I don't think that's where
it's going to really I think is going to
greatly evolved from that I mean when we
talk about price point everyone's saying
that a modular phone could be low priced
but if you want to go above and beyond
just how much are we gonna have to pay
for these different for these different
parts well if I can jump back in there I
cannot stop thinking about google glass
you know the you know the pilot project
for that one you know explorer edition
was still $1,500 and you know you might
think that project ara and project glass
have about the same chances of survival
and well glass is essentially being shut
down here for little bits yeah and it's
nice that it's going to be in Puerto
Rico I do think that's a good thing
because you know that that kind of makes
it seem like that it's going to be for
emerging markets but I really don't
think that's ever going to stay there
people there's going to be a phone in
view no matter what but like as far as
these these these modules are concerned
we haven't seen too many of them yet
what are the cup what would a phone look
like with all the modules that you would
want to have in there we already have a
lot of examples in this one phone market
of these high-end devices but what if
these parts would you mix and match
together let's let's start off with
Andrew on that one well as far as you
can mix and match just about anything
there's different sizes and it goes on
to the back and there's a magnetic force
that keeps them in place I think the
front uses pins but the back is where
most of the customization happens hmm
and there's going to be initially around
20 to 40 different modules and it's not
just gonna be like processors and RAM
there's also going to be like different
kinds of sensors you know things that
could be specialized for workplaces but
things could be specialized for home use
and you know that base which is what
gets me concerned how they're going to
make all that work but yeah basically
they're going to allow you to swap any
kind of part and any basically there's
no limits to what a what someone can
develop for it which is a fascinating
concept but once again logistics I think
it's going to get in the way how are
they going to manage all this how are
they going to make sure everything's
working right you know like a feisty dad
mentioned that you know they're going to
do this through a storefront at some
point which is true but even so just
testing all of it for all the different
configurations because you have you know
let's say at some point you have a
hundred different modules they're gonna
have to test each of these in different
scenarios with different pairings and I
just I think it's gonna be mess I think
it's a great idea but I think it's gonna
be a mess yeah I mean that was no
something that I kept thinking of what
we were talking about this was just what
will what will the other manufacturers
have to say and what project argh be
strictly a google project that is well
isn't isn't really out sourced out you
know what I mean they're allowing anyone
but the frames initially are going to be
built by Google's so that you know the
mainframe the spiral to is the newest
one that's going to be by Google but the
modules can be by anyone but what I'm
really you know you were talking about
how I you could see it moving into you
know outside of the emerging markets
which is true but the big concern there
is how carriers will react and how will
they play a part are they going to get
an onboard where they're designing their
own modules I could see Verizon doing
that having giant Verizon logos
everywhere on the back of the modules
gee you know but very horrible
the verizon bloatware module yo oh good
god that'd be terrible how great would
that be those dip if all of the
bloatware from like 18 seer of verizon
was just on one little module that you
could just just pluck out OD acted like
i just had a great video idea if they do
do that we have to do the smash the
verizon bloat module baby I'll do it
I'll volunteer to dude I have a
sledgehammer I think people would really
love that I think that'd be great but i
love i love where that's going like what
would the thing that i can get out of my
head when I can't think about project
ara is there just there's so much room
for creativity and creation but there's
also so much room for regulation and I'm
really scared of what you're right these
carriers would do with project ara
that's where I think the major pip honk
like it they're not gonna like it huh
you don't think so not at all I mean
unless they can find a way to control it
and I'm not sure kind of comes down to
what Google you know allows them to do
where it doesn't allow them to do but
the idea of having to you know certify
all these parts and make sure they're
approved is verizon it's going to be bad
for the carriers like verizon but it's
going to be bad for consumers to i think
in a way because you know our is verizon
gonna have lockouts where only certain
modules work that they've approved for
their network cuz you know verizon is
one you know and so is eighteen eighty
they're all are where they like to test
everything very you know vigorously and
if it doesn't meet their standards and
so are they can allow any old module to
work with it that's where it gets you
know at first I'd say into the very
foreseeable future probably 5-10 years I
think it's going to be an unlocked only
thing I don't think carriers who can
even be involved yeah and you know gonna
be love I imagine people are going to
have just like the skeleton available
because that might be all they can
afford at the moment yeah and then just
kind of put things in little by little
Joe any anything away in on here about
availability rather of project ara given
carriers and whatnot I think I think
grow she's pretty much right I think
it's going to be one of those unlock
things it's gonna be just like the Nexus
was when it first came out your the
nexus one was only unlocked you could
only really buy that you know from
google's website and then you know it
wasn't until what was it like the Nexus
S that you could actually buy it on a
carrier I think it's going to be exactly
the same
thing with project honor thank you one
of those things you have to buy it
straight from google you have to buy the
parts at least the initial parts
straight from google and then as it
evolves it'll start falling into more
hands you start getting it more places
but no i think rush is absolutely
correct on this on that one mhm so i
wanna if you don't mind I wouldn't mind
posing a question comfortably yeah any
of you guys seriously just like chime in
whenever you wish so you know I i I've
heard you all say hey it's a cool idea
you know for the nerd side of me to be
able to build parts how much would you
be willing to pay for such a you know
for such a thing I mean what would you
consider like for the base for the
processors I mean how much to build the
phone you want how much would you be
able to sing this requires a lot of
knowledge as to how much these parts are
even required how much do I was saying
you know ballpark I mean you feel that
you know is that to build a complete
phone should it be pretty close to what
you're paying for a flagship are you
willing to pay it you know a thousand
plus I mean well yeah that's yeah that's
really interesting how about how about
what the price that you kind of put out
there what what are the modules you
would put in that hopefully create that
price point how about that um you know I
from my perspective it would depend on
the benefits cuz you know you go and
dump fifteen hundred dollars into a
desktop and you're going to be able to
play like the latest games at you know
flawless 1080 sometimes even you know to
k for k at you know 30 60 frames per
second depending you know and it's it
there's value in spending that much in a
desktop PC and even you know spending
twenty two thousand dollars on a laptop
you know there's value in that and I
think the question it's not necessarily
like what would you pay to build a
project or phone but I think the better
question is what value is there in
spending that much more because I know
that one of the things you know is crush
you mentioned like for workplace so like
you know if you're a handyman and you
can turn your you know this is a
horrible example I want to go with
anyway but you can turn your phone into
like a Geiger counter by popping in a
module you know that that person would
probably be able yeah I would definitely
pay you know two hundred dollars for a
Geiger counter module but you know for
me you know i'm a gamer all you know all
flagship android phones currently play
all
game so you know what's the benefit to
spending extra money if I'm not going to
get any extra benefit from anything
that's out right now yeah i think it's
it's it does matter whether or not a
let's say mid-range phone it doesn't
cost more than current mid-range
offerings and i think that's that's
going to be sort of a key when it comes
to whether or not this kind of ecosystem
is going to be successful at least from
the outset feisty what does a what does
a what does a project or a phone look
like for you at what price point see
this is a tough one I've thought about
this a lot actually and there is no
possible way for me to build a project
or a device you know I would need a 14
inch tablet to have enough space for all
of the pieces that I want and and I
think that you know that speaks again to
the hot swap ability the pieces however
you know I'm just at Christmas time here
I picked up a few little phones I mean
they were thirty dollars a piece wrote
about them on the site they're actually
pretty good little phones and I'm using
that for a specific purpose you know one
is an mp3 player one takes pictures you
know there I've already got these cheap
devices they're set to the side they're
focused driven I think if I were
building a project our device at I might
have to buy or build more than one so
that again I can have these multiple
devices with with specific purpose so
that becomes a problem for me because it
won't like you're saying price tag if
every module is anywhere from you know
twenty dollars to three hundred dollars
at that price tags can be over a
thousand and no time yeah I just really
think that it's that the price will rock
it so easily when it comes to a lot of
these parts you know and and you were
talking about having different phones
for different or different devices for
different situations I mean isn't that
sort of the point of a modular phone
however is being able to take out let's
say a let's say you take out like oh I
was thinking about in Joe's case you
know what if he wanted to really test
out an app for performance you would
take out his Snapdragon 600 which costs
let's say two hundred dollars and then
pop in the Tegra x1 that hopefully
we'll come in you know then you can
really do some benchmarking on a nap you
really think you would need more than
one skeleton for for everything you do
feist yes absolutely I'm as is i'm
already using more than one phone and
they serve different purposes and I mean
again I'm holding down 16 different jobs
okay not that many but it feels like
it's some days but so you know you can
only install so many Google accounts
onto a single device and you know well
one device is making a phone call you
need that next device to be doing
something else and then you know if
you're using one device as an mp3 player
it's on the other side of the room is
hooked up to the stereo you're not
taking calls on that seeing one device
one project our device with hot
swappable pieces again not for me and
maybe as one of my devices even my main
device wow I wasn't expecting that to be
the way that you soak it like the that's
really cool down that's really cool
though that you you know yourself so
well as a user to be able to know that
but wow that's interesting I imagine you
have my sample of extreme multitasker
exactly you have like we have like a
phone for every little task it's like
you have like I imagine you like
surrounded by 10 phones right now all
doing something different there's only
six sorry all right how about you go see
what is the what what is your price
point for something like this honestly I
I'm not rich so it comes down to what I
can afford but you know I would easily
pay eight hundred dollars or so maybe
even a thousand if I could have enough
components for where I see the potential
in arua is ok so I have my base phone it
has you know what's Snapdragon you know
a 258 10 whatever by the time I get to
it you know it has a base amount of RAM
three gigs maybe you know as basic
storage but you know I'm gonna go
camping this weekend let's say and so
you know I'm not going to be I'm going
to have an actual decent camera with me
so I'm not going to using the camera on
my phone so we can take that module out
I'm going to put in an extra battery or
so i'm going to move things around and
just the ability to say hey now i have
two three four days of battery life
because i've loaded this thing up maybe
I put in a weaker processor because i'm
not going to need that but i want a good
battery life something happens i can
make a call make a text that's really
I think our is amazing is you know you
can adjust the phone's hardware based on
your use case you know there might be
times where I need you know the best
processor and I put that in or I might
need more battery life or might need a
good camera and that's where I think ara
will have a lot of potential for the
nerd type for the emerging type it's
going to just come down to hey I can
slowly but surely update this and
they're not going to want to pay a lot
they're not going to need very powerful
processors and I think that our akan
cater to both sides yeah I think that's
one of the phone envy is going to come
in though you can have those people that
are like oh I got this Snapdragon 400
yeah I keep thinking of project ara in
terms of what I put in there will make
me feel like I have a certain type of
phone so let's say someone makes a moto
g are and and they they work with that
and one day they're like okay I got I
got a little more money or I really want
this boost in productivity or or or or
processing power I'll throw in that
Snapdragon 805 and make this a moto x
and I do think that there's a lot of
there's a lot of benefit to something
like that I also think that hopefully
hopefully hopefully the the price point
is going to be very reasonable depending
on the parts that you get maybe I really
think that they're going to kind of take
advantage of that the fact that someone
doesn't have to pay for everything right
away so they can I guess overpriced
certain parts so you have to settle you
know I kind of I'm a little bit cynical
like that I I'm like that sometimes
where I really feel like I have to
settle for certain parts or certain
things before I could really go to the
upper echelon but funny how you know I
feel like andrew grush the way that you
put it that's really what Google is
trying to go for is that whole idea of
slowly upgrading and then Google's
probably listening to this right now and
thinking Jonathan face is not one of
those customers that we want but you
know so let's let's let's get a little
bit creative here i want it i want to
know what kind of modules do you want on
your phone i crush was talking about i
don't really need a camera you know what
would let's let's let's reach for the
brass ring here what what are the things
that you really want on your phone that
may have been there before or is not
there now something that you really
would want to put on your side no no
expense spared you know something i was
thinking about while well these guys are
talking was how cool would
have like a module that would allow you
to switch like your entire Android
experience from say your phone to your
SmartWatch or to your you know Google
glass or something like that and be like
okay well i'm done with google glass
right now i'm gonna pop this module out
stick it back in my phone and you know i
have those apps in that data available
to me whenever I need it and I thought
that is something I thought was I was
just kind of working with in my brain
it's literally four minutes old but
you're not to have like you know have a
module on my android wear SmartWatch
pull it out pop it in my phone you know
install some apps on their do some
customization and stuff like that pop it
back out you know put it back in the
watch you know body you know a project
ara where I guess and does not roll off
the tongue very easily no it doesn't but
you know and just be able to customize
you know instead of you know thinking
about one device that you can put
everything into you know think of it
more it's like you have two or three
devices that you can interchange
everything with like you know something
like what Feist would you know want just
not with multiple phones but just
multiple gadgets in general like you pop
out a module stick it in your car and
all of a sudden you have access to your
google play music you know stuff like
that that i thought would be really kind
of cool and that would be something that
would spend a lot of money on feisty is
probably over there like now that's too
much more when I get in my car again I
want to get my car there's already a
phone there yeah that's the car you know
it he's got one on the glued on the
dashboard another one taped on the visor
it pulls it down and there's the
navigation the story's coming soon Shay
has right I don't think I really want to
know the answer to this but is there one
in the bathroom too ready to go oh
that's like that's like the 12-inch
that's where the tablet comes in no
comment that's a great idea though being
able to hotswap from one apparatus to
another and I just trying I'm just
trying to wrap my head around what a
project are aware but I would even look
like a project where r or whatever they
want to whatever they would call it I
imagine it would have to be pretty big
to be able to hold something like that
we're talking like 20 20 50 like but
when computing finally gets that small I
suppose
but it wouldn't be like a permanent
thing when you stick it into your phone
I'd imagine just having it pretty much
the size of an LG G while she's just
being able to like pop off the screen
but like the screen also contains all
the circuitry underneath for the you
know the storage in what have you and
then when you pop it into the phone here
the phone has the RAM and the processor
already so you don't need to take that
with you you keep all that stuff in the
watch and then just take the you know
the removable stuff and then being able
to I don't know it's just again five
minutes now I've been thinking about
this so but I can't imagine it would be
that big if they did it right i mean
some of those modules are pre you know
friggin small it's not like these things
are the size of coffee tables true and
honestly that a even in under five
minutes that already sounds like a
pretty well hashed out idea it's just a
matter of obviously the rd um but let's
talk about a smartphone here Joe what's
the one module you gotta have on the
back of that phone or the front if you
want talk about the display that's a
really good question um given what I do
with my android devices I would want the
best conceivable cpu / GPU either
combination or individually and I
actually hope that something they do is
separate them and allow us to upgrade
our GPU and CPU separately because that
would be awesome yeah just like a
desktop but I would want the best of the
best in there because if there's
anything I can't stand it's game lag
especially on Android where you can't
just like turn down the graphics on most
games to get the frame rates up so you
know like i was playing um Rick Riptide
gp2 oh my note 3 and it stuttered once
and I almost threw the damn thing
against the wall uh-huh because i was
like no you're a note 3 you do not do
that to me so that that's what i would
do your ass you're a stutter not see
that's why i like it's just like the
moment you see like a little bit of
sutter on like a like a TouchWiz thing
like not worst course together I say I
can handle it in the UI it's not so bad
but you know in games it's like come on
for real fair enough um okay cool well I
agree they're definitely uh how about a
feisty over there what's what's the one
thing you need to have on the back
Your Honor I would actually like a full
io panel I want USB ports i want hdmi oh
I want you know of course that's what
feisty says yeah you know yeah it's
tough sometimes a lot of these phones
that you know they just they don't
connect to anything you know sometimes a
physical connection is nice to have and
for me that's a major disadvantage to a
lot of Android devices now again you
wouldn't want to use that all the time
and certainly when you're on the go it
doesn't much matter but you know I spend
most of my time at the house you know
sitting at the office and connecting to
the stereo is important connecting to an
external monitor is very important there
you go that was a nice my dad so what is
I well what things exactly are going to
be connecting to hear and you said the
monitor and stereo and whatnot but if
you have like a full panel with like I
with like USB ports and whatnot are you
transferring data back and forth a lot
or is is that what the idea is there
well there is some data of course we do
a lot of screen shots and having to
transfer those but I mean wireless is
easy enough for those specifically I
think of the media I'm always listening
to music I'm surprised you can't even
hear in the background right now I'm
going I turned it off heck which bonus
which phone is playing that right now
actually I find the LG devices are some
fairly decent i would love high fidelity
that would be very nice and there again
would be another chip that i want to go
with that is you know i don't want just
plain old mp3 playback i want some
high-end lost lezbot audio flac right
well I get a lot of flack over that no
sorry bad joke very nice ones are punny
it's a it's interesting you bring up the
audio part because really the one of the
modules that you're gonna be having to
put on the back of there might be a
speaker grill for example and when I
noticed at least on the front of these
is uh you know this ecosystem is gonna
take on an identity of its own there's
really only room for a screen up front
you can't really find space for like a
boom sound speaker front
chasing you know unless I'm wrong that's
actually uh looking at the skeleton they
did design it so you could have a
smaller screen on there that you could
have room for that actually I was
another early presentation slide so it's
possible okay who knows what they're
gonna put on the front though but that
I'm gonna save that for after we hear
from grouchy because I it's great that
you said that because I really that's
where I would put one of my most wanted
modules but I'll get into that after we
hear what brushes aura would look like
well what's the one module you gotta
have well home one sec before uh Ferger
she starts I know exactly what module
feisty wants on the back of his phone a
whole second phone have one walking yeah
have one phone turn the damn thing over
and there's a whole nother phone with
fresh stuff right there really nice I
didn't cases oh no it's true all right
sorry aggression bud go ahead oh it's
all good um let's see uh maybe a Taser
who doesn't want a Taser well I mean uh
in all seriousness for me batteries uh
the more battery life the better coming
from a nexus 5 and having to carry
around tons of external battery packs
all the time I mean I think I'd like for
it see yes I remember yeah yeah I hadn't
like everywhere that I kept plugging
them in and so coming from that battle
we should be very important to me but
you know just thinking outside of myself
you know I just wanted to make the point
some of the stuff I could this was just
flooding on my head when we were talking
just stuff for like health to like a
glucose monitor for example you don't
built in the phone no no what Reagan you
know that would be awesome a man after
my own heart grow she knows that's
that's why yeah that's working kinda
thought they're just kissing up to me
right now my dad just kind of popped
into my head that's kind of cool you
know listeners for those for those of
you who do not know already I've said
this many times on our channel on
YouTube I am a type 2 diabetic so I have
been very much into the health portion
of Android as of late but yeah that's
definitely I'm in full agreement on that
I didn't even think about that yeah just
all those kind of sensors you know
there's all sorts of health sensors that
can be built in you know people who have
special you know who either have special
health needs or special education you
know there's a
room for that oh yeah for sure um yeah
like a glucose meter I'm trying to think
of what some other ones would be like a
like a legit heart rate monitor but I
mean yeah I get really i think that's
not the cheap little yeah junkie what
Samsung gives us yeah exactly um yeah no
one said like fingerprint monitor audion
fingerprint scanner rather or anything
like that um but yes scanner I iris
scanner they'll be so tight we have to
turn the phone around and then look into
true yeah they did have to have room on
the front for that or something you know
yeah definitely i love it i think i
think you you want with taser though
I've f it yeah nazar would be awesome I
mean who doesn't want a Taser just yeah
yeah I just imagine like some like 21
year old like club hopping like girl
like walking out of a club like hold on
Becky this guy's follow me at ur phone
around his jab a guy in the ribs with it
dragged around talk to again but you
know would be like dude spies spies
would be able to like do all kinds of
really awesome stuff with project oh
baby the James Bond phone do you have
like a laser they can cut things and
like you want to take a picture and it
shoots pepper spray stuff like that
didn't I have a Taser phone one time
though wasn't it like the matrix phone
like when there is a Taser phone try to
remember that was a while back i'm a
recovering that yeah yes i was one act
it was the phone from the matrix wasn't
it the second Matrix I'm try remember
that you know the matrix movie right and
then yeah listen it was really there was
an iphone case though or something or it
was some bleep I think was an iphone
case that really exists that a Taser
built into it yeah I remember reading
about while back okay well it's fine so
it's been done technically mmm batteries
krushi without that you mentioned what
one report that I that I read was saying
that when you were able to take out when
the battery gets down low this the
skeleton or rather the the actual driver
cpu of the of the project ara phone will
be able to draw power from the battery
that's about to die so that you have
enough time to remove it and then put
another one in yep um that sounds pretty
awesome I just gotta say but I mean it's
just another okay one day we're gonna
talk about this I'm sure it's gonna be a
Friday debate topic but I'm really
getting sick of all of these different
workarounds that all these companies
have when really the main problem we
have is batteries are really not
they should be right now it's like the
one piece of a phone that hasn't really
evolved over the last or they're at or
they're too worried about thinness you
know and you know not that we want brick
phones but I think most of us will be
willing to sacrifice a little bit of
space for a bigger battery oh yeah I
know definitely i'd have had this
conversation with a lot of people you
know across the blog or industry where
they say like oh the biggest problem
with android is the you know the OEM
skins or the biggest problem with
android or the cameras aren't as good as
iOS like know the biggest problem with
android and the one that everybody
complains about is the fact that these
things die after 16 hours mm-hmm you
know with pretty me like two hours if
you have a nexus oh oh ho a one year old
nexus i can imagine that yeah the
batteries not so yeah it's not so hot
anymore it's starting to its starting to
have lots of issues let's just put it
that way yeah I love my Nexus 5 but it's
starting to have some problems I mean I
remember the Galaxy Nexus I was so bad
that sprint was giving out about
extended batteries for free like I got
when they were like oh yeah you know you
can have this extended battery for free
and they just sent it fit in the
original shell and everything like but
that you know I totally agree like you
know a lot of people have a lot of
problems with Android but the biggest
problem that everybody has is hey this
battery sucks yeah like no matter like i
have it in video shoot i got it for days
ago I can kill the thing in 10 hours
flat and it's got like I think it's over
5,000 milliamp hours in the batteries I
think it's even larger than that and I
can still kill it in 10 hours and that's
just it's absurd yeah I can imagine
people with them with our phones having
a specific pocket in their bag with just
a bunch of battery modules like thank
you we need a module that actually will
accept all of the other different types
of batteries and we've all got the extra
batteries from our previous phones in
previous lives and you know be able to
use those instead of having to buy new
ones would be nice that would be coming
out of that is a fat module to be able
to put in like a d battery or like an
eyeball decay start where we go
yeah well I guess for me what I was
going to say was yeah the module that I
would really want would be on the front
and that's because I have been very very
open about the fact that I miss old form
factors and one of them happens to be
the phone that has a friggin keyboard I
knew this was coming exactly because
back when we were I CES now this is
gonna be a little bit controversial but
I was actually saying that I was very
close just going to a local sort and
picking up the new blackberry because I
had the original blackberry bold because
I keyboard was just amazing back in the
day and now they have a newer version
and I can talk about blackberry right
now because you can sideload android on
there so okay so I'm not really
portraying everybody right now but
really they the keyboard is kind of
compelling to me and like I was telling
the guys right before our podcast I
actually am about to go through a full
review process and vlog about my my
adventures with the original google
phone the g1 and this is the one where
the screen literally slid out of the way
and there was a full qwerty keyboard if
i can get a screen like that on my aura
phone i would love that but if i could
maybe maybe put a little bit of a little
bit of space on the bottom in order to
put like a full qwerty keyboard on there
let's just say of blackberry quality
then i think that would be really great
oh yeah going i was gonna say on the
subject of like the hinging screens did
any of you guys ever used the HTC g2
that the successor to the g one and
right had that really unique like z
hinge that like you know an odd could
you imagine that like on a project ara
phone being able to have like a whole
second row of modules that you could
just slide out and pop back in oh man
laughs yeah it takes people around just
have a whole second row of all the more
module space I know josh is talk about
the screen that literally slid out of
the way and I was like oh what if you
just put more modules behind it like and
still have the screen just kind of slide
over and I made that phone would be the
size of a Bible but you know it would be
interesting that that yeah yeah our
phones are getting big enough as it is
you know and I really don't imagine that
there aren't going to be people out
there who just stack on stack on stack
modules
you know and who knows maybe people
maybe like I see set kickstarter let's
just get over to Kickstarter and
someone's gonna make a module that will
add another panel for modules or
something like that I think it's that
kind of openness of modules that will
kind of make a break the the emerging
markets I think of china for example in
this may be a bad example and i'm going
here but you look at all of the
copyright violations that that happen in
china and i think that would be a huge
huge major factor for you know project
are moving forward we can get 3d printed
modules here you can get the verizon
logo you can get a picture of your
kitten your puppy your child but i
imagine that over in a lot of the asian
markets you would get the Hello Kitty
modules you would get the appropriately
the transformer modules and I think
those could you know again the openness
and to be able to downgrade maybe the
specifications to bring the price down
but but that kind of personalization I
think we'll go big in a lot of those
markets I do a great yeah there might
even be modules that are just made to
look you know it's a yeah that they
actually talked about that a little bit
plus they're gonna make it so you can
pretty much customize like any module
you can have the back customized the
what have what did they refer that to us
again a shell the shell right the shelf
of the module or what web Trevor well
yeah there the shell is the or the frame
or the endoskeleton is the actual thing
that all the pieces go into I can't
remember exactly what they call I just
call modules there's no name for the
actual module i permit i swear i saw
this term where did there was though
it's three things that's the chit's the
exoskeleton the module and then the
thing that goes on top of the module to
give it its look that was that was the
part I couldn't like I can't remember
what the term was and but in any case I
do completely agree that that's going to
happen one
it's only a matter of time before
something like this is gonna turn into a
commercialization type of deal and which
shot you know what kind of fun you guys
got me thinking uh as far as if they're
having Kickstarter and all these places
people throwing out modules Google's
probably going to have to if they're
going to make this work they're probably
going to have to have some kind of like
drm where you know some kind of like
digital rights management that you know
only ones that have been approved by
Google work cuz they're else androids
not going to be able to handle all that
you know don't dumb did I was getting at
there was they're gonna have to yeah
yeah if it goes through google and
everything has to be so to speak drm
door approved for copyright decency well
that lymphatics i think it'll really
block things especially in the emerging
markets that's but you know if you look
at you know Disney properties you know
you go to the disney store and you buy a
baseball cap it's got Mickey on the top
you pay a premium for that and premium
is exactly the opposite of what these
emerging markets need yeah and those
companies are gonna be the ones who will
be able to mark it up like that's that's
you pay a little bit more for something
that's got Mickey's face on it or god
forbid frozen and you know something
like that you know just you got paid
just a little bit more just have that
branding on there and then you know it's
just not a topic we have to get into
right now but you know it just imagine
what our would look like for kids and
you know what all of these parents are
going to have to deal with in order to
create these phones that their kids will
enjoy using because of what is on top of
them the branding and all of the the the
stuff that these companies do to them to
make them more thats a kid friendly but
the same would go for even adults like
what imagine somebody would like logos
on the back or just just any company
could probably make just their own ways
of making some of creating a module or
whatever cover goes on top of it and
it's a it's it's a broader guard i think
to me is going to be a very nice way of
shaking up the system but whereas
originally I don't know if everyone
remembers this but originally this was a
was an IndieGoGo or was a Kickstarter
that this originally was um it was there
ya know project now before project ara
there was a company that was
phonebloks film blocks there it is they
were just basically they had a concept
idea and then motorola because they were
the ones that were behind this
originally they came out and talked to
phone box today actually we have this
we've been working on this for a while
and they weren't going to announce
project ara until you know I think it
was still six months or so out from
being announced but since phonebloks had
already given them the perfect
introduction basically they started
teaming up and since then phonebloks has
been basically working with Google now
since you know Motorola is no longer
part of Google and they've been doing a
lot of updates that you know you go to
their site and they'll have all these
updates for what you know motor oh I'm
sorry Google is doing with project ara
and so yeah it started with foam blocks
but it wasn't it wasn't like an open
source project was just more like a
concept they were like hey this is what
we think would be cool oh and they
wanted to get people interested in the
idea they were trying to generate and
that's why you like I remember when we
first covered covered this we're like
hat that's a pipe dream that will never
happen but then all of a sudden mold
Motorola came out said hey we're doing
it was like wow okay i guess this can't
happen crew and what came with it was
the backing and also all the pitfalls of
being part of a huge corporation that's
what i'm trying to say and you know it's
a he'll be really interesting to see
where this comes out do you guys think
that I mean if it's going to come out in
Puerto Rico then what's to stop any of
us even from just getting one from there
and going straight to the source and go
ahead and do like a preliminary review
on it i'm sure a lot of people on the
outlets and media outlets are gonna go
ahead and find a way to get from Puerto
Rico you know and I'm sure you know who
we're gonna get our we're gonna get a
pretty good look at it here in 2015 I
think ebay for the win yeah right well
and I'm just I'm sure they'll probably
pretty tight on the regulations like you
know kind of like they were at Google
glass you're not technically supposed to
resell it you know I'm sure they'll do
some of that yeah you know but that it
won't stop people from getting her hands
mmhmm yeah um ok so i guess i guess the
final question that I want to pose here
because we live in a world right now in
the smartphone let's say Android space
where we basically have the incumbent as
the way but we'll say it all of these
big companies that
here samsung LG and whatnot do you think
that creating an ecosystem like a
project or a ecosystem is going to
change the way that all of these
companies move forward with the way that
they create smartphones or do you think
this is going to be in a point to be a
mass adoption of this type of this type
of ecosystem um I think it's going to be
the I'm sorry little phlegm there I
think that OEMs are probably going to
end up manufacturing parts for are
assuming it does get a hold in you know
in the mobile industry because that can
be you know it could be a savior for
some like you know Samsung is on the
fall according to their sales numbers
HTC's you know been down so many times
it's like they got mud stomped or
something and you know HTC you know
manufacturing parts for project ara
could be another way for them to get
back into the mobile industry without
having to come out with a phone that
beats the iphone or a samsung phone in
sales every year so that i know that
that was something that was i I think it
was vaguely discussed when this whole
thing first started happening was you
know that there were going to be 0 ms
that you know bought into the project or
a premise and i think that's something
that's going to happen if project are
starts taking off here there's you just
another way of getting revenue for them
ok feisty you don't think that we're
going to see like a like a samsung
modular phone any time in the future do
you think that they're going to be like
wow joe said they're just going to
create the parts and kind of sort of
piggyback on the success of this
ecosystem hopefully if it is successful
am I allowed to say yes and no ok
expresso well ok getting the humor out
of the way we talking you use the name
Sam song and who knows what they're
going to build we might build six
different versions you've been anyways
project teasin oh no I can certainly see
a lot of the company's getting involved
in it and possibly putting out a module
or two but I actually think that project
ara will work backwards we're going to
see the third party people come in with
some great idea
four modules and then the Samsungs htcs
and stuff are going to not build their
own module versions but just build these
things into their own phones I think
that's kind of where it'll go hmm to a
bit of a mixture of the two absolutely
yeah look it pretty interesting what if
what if there is a what if what if a
phone came out that just had one little
area for one module that you can change
in and out to just add something to what
is already existing that might be one
way of looking at it brushy uh yeah they
both both Joe and feisty made some
really good points uh I don't think that
it comes down to how successful it is
but yeah there's gonna be copycats in
fact you none of you may know this and
some of you might there already is a
copycat project in the works from ZTE
called the eco mobis i believe it's
called yeah I'm with him it's called at
cts i believe it's eco mobis I think
it's or bobis I'm not a hundred percent
sure on the pronunciation of it but it's
dt's take on project aura and it's they
haven't shown really much they just
talked about it basically and so you're
gonna see I think you're gonna see that
the Chinese companies make clones if
they think that they can push us
especially if it starts taking off in
emerging markets you don't think Chinese
Chinese companies are going to want to
get a piece of that pie and they're not
going to want to work together they
don't and so you're gonna see you can
see all of them you can see oppo you're
gonna see you know you're gonna see what
way you can see all these companies
making their clones I don't think the
big boys samsung LG I don't think they
will initially I could see them getting
involved with modules but I don't know
if they'd want to do that because that
would dilute from you know their core
stuff I believe that feisty has the
right angle I could see them taking you
know hey this module is really cool
let's throw this on our phone you know I
see them taking that route more and
actually Josh you made a good point I
could see there being you know with the
control it say hey okay well there's one
little area where you can we have 15
different things you can swap into that
one spot yeah you know you can have
either heart rate monitor or a
fingerprint scanner or exactly where you
know an extra battery or whatever you
know yeah and I could see you know I
could see that but i don't i don't see
samsung or any of the
the bigger players getting involved but
I do see that i do see the chinese and
even the indian companies i do see them
jumping in especially if it's proved
successful emerging market yeah
definitely and if there's any water that
you're seeing some real i guess maybe
the word is not quite innovation maybe
that word is low strong but if you want
to see some real creativity then yeah we
have seen quite a bit coming out the
chinese market i agree with that I also
think what I was thinking was what if
the exoskeleton was created by a
particular manufacturer that brought
with it certain features that you then
added on to with the modules that more
or less are interchangeable no matter
what skeleton you have I think it would
be hard to convince the man you know
Samsung and all the other manufacturers
to play nice to one standard cuz what's
in it for them you know they would be
able to control it they won't be able to
decide what modules work what don't i
don't think they would just like
carriers i don't think they're gonna
want to play ball to that level mmhmm
yeah that's true so we do be there it's
a kind of a cynical point of view but i
really do think that it has a lot Mary
sorry yeah she you room to think they
come to one standard I mean I guess
they've done it in the pc industry to an
extent well what were you saying feisty
i was just gonna say you know crèche is
saying that the these guys are not
likely to play well together is google
the competition are they going to play
nice with project are on the first place
yeah you know that was that was one of
the points I I brought up way earlier at
the beginning was you know having
Android you know work in such a manner
that you know you can do the hot
swapping and all that stuff if it were
built to do that what exactly could
Google do to stop them from not playing
nice you know because it would you know
Android would boot and work on anything
as long as the drivers were already in
there so you know it wouldn't matter
whether or not they wanted to play nice
because the software would already be
compatible you know just like windows is
or just like Linux is you know you got
you know if you can install as if you
can install it on anything then you know
you don't need anybody to play nice it's
just there for people to use whatever
which is like I said earlier that's why
it's it's gonna be a
just excite Mara there I'm not for sure
how they're gonna regulate it but
Google's going to figure out a way to
keep them from doing certain things and
it's that's where I think it's gonna run
to a lot of what make or break is how
their how they handle it how they work
with manufacturers how they work with
module developers we've seen a little
bit and Google's been very open with
this project so far but it's just uh
it's really a massively ambitious
project I'm still not convinced that
it's feasible long-term I know what's
coming out soon technically but as far
as truly getting out in large numbers I
don't know I still think it's quite a
ways off yeah I think I think really
that's that's a good that's a good point
on consensus there is like we got to see
it in the wild first before we can make
any real judgments on it but obviously
speculation is speculation and that's
exactly what we do here at the Friday
debate but you know like I said we're
we're discussing project all right here
and I just wanted to open up the panel
one last time before we went ahead and
said goodbye to our our listeners here
thank you so much for listening to our
first episode of this podcast all of our
guys over here Andrew Joe and John any
last thoughts on project ara in general
um no sorry it's almost one o'clock in
the morning I'm brain dead right now
thank God we did like I said talk the
ears off of this thing so I'm sure that
if we didn't have any that's perfectly
fine how about you guys Andrew and John
I think we're headed in the right
direction here you know project ara it
looks like it's going to be a lot of fun
if nothing else certainly the the
modular design and that the ability to
get in at hopefully a lower price point
and then build it up from there and and
survive through upgrades you know bring
in the new processor so that you can
support you know the newer operating
systems and you hopefully keep that
exoskeleton through a few different
iterations of Android Edna I think it's
along the right tracks I just as bruh
she said I think the logistics might
kill this poor thing yeah rushing um you
know basically what feisty said I feel
that they're heading in the right
direction I think it's a really
this project at one point I wasn't for
sure they could do anything with it and
they're getting there they're heading in
the right direction but I think that on
one hand the pc industry has been doing
this forever and it's been working but
androids a whole different ball park and
I'm just not convinced that without some
massive work I think we're not there you
know maybe by the you know three or four
iterations of Android from now maybe
they will develop that but I think we're
still five years off before our I could
really be what it means to be a game
changer as it were yeah exactly i think
it's just gonna be one of those little
hey cool did you hear that they're doing
this with ara but as far as any major
you know adoption from anyone it'll be a
while no I just had a thought actually
if I may yeah we thinking of project ara
so much as a you know as a phone as a
personal device that sits in our pocket
so to speak there's always room in the
industrial part of the world where a
module isn't so to speak a little tiny
piece but it's a full robotic arm on an
assembly line I think there could be
room for project ara as a tool as the
operating system and and brains for
commercial robotics that is a nifty idea
attaching the screen to the robot giving
it some commands onion on attaching it
so no one else can mess with it or
anything that's what is definitely
really cool we're always looking at
things from a consumer perspective but
obviously a lot of what has been good
for us as consumers has been brought
into many work-related industrial even
let's say private sector areas as well
project tango was a good example of that
you know they're putting it you know
they've been working with NASA and
putting it in you know robotics and NASA
and so yeah you know he makes a good
point they've been doing with project
tango Google's other you know and so
yeah there's definitely room outside of
the consumer field for it too absolutely
so even if project car doesn't
necessarily take off as it were for for
people like us it could find a home and
plenty of other places oh yeah
definitely yeah all right well and with
that will go ahead and close the book on
this particular topic for this week we
