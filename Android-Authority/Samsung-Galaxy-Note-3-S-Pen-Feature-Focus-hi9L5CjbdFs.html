of the Galaxy Note line has been the
s-pen and for the Galaxy Note 3 it has
been made even better it's Josh of
regard from Android authority what's
going on everybody
and welcome to this galaxy note 3
feature focus this time regarding the
s-pen the s-pen is the little friend
that allows the Galaxy Note to do much
more than your average smartphone in
this version of the note 3 it has been
given a more symmetrical design that can
be inserted easier into the phone as
well as a lighter feel it might be a
pain to handle for much larger hands but
for me it's been just fine as a pointer
and a handwriting tool we start off with
what's already available in the s-pen
before you even get into the apps and
extra features get in the settings menu
and you'll see that the note device is
able to detect if the pen is inserted or
it's out in the wild you are able to
customize what happens when you remove
the pen such as noises or vibrations or
even if the Air Command menu pops up
when you do so and then there is the
small cursor that you see on the screen
as you hover the tip of the S Pen over
the screen and this is where we get into
some actual functions from just about
anywhere on the phone you can begin to
use the s-pen for a few key tasks that
button on the pen itself is very
important and is the gateway to a lot of
uses when hovering over the screen and
seeing that little dot you can press it
and the Air Command menu comes up but
we'll get to that a little later note
that the gestures that opened for
example the quick command pop-up in the
previous Note 2 aren't here anymore
instead of simple movements with the
s-pen while pressing the button you can
just enclose any shape you create to
clip out and save that particular piece
for later usage this is the simplistic
level of capturing your screen that is
immediately available hovering the pen
over the various parts of the interface
will give you some contextual
information for example hovering over a
gallery folder will give you a preview
of what's inside and this is the same 4
icon folders on the home screen perhaps
the most useful of these contextual
pop-ups is the direct pen input in which
a small icon comes up when you hover
over a textbox hit that icon and you'll
get a quick pad that uses handwriting
recognition to insert what words you
write into the textbox it's a great and
easy way of getting straight to
handwriting input definitely faster and
arguably better than the handwriting
part of the built-in keyboard alright
let's get into some apps the one you may
already be
familiar with and is a pretty obvious
necessity for things like the s-pen is a
note taking application and in the note
3 it's called S note for the most part
this is where you can create just about
anything to help you visualize what's
going on in your head it's been given a
little bit of an overhaul interface wise
mainly to give you a quick look at the
notes that are inside of the various
notebooks you have just drag down on a
notebook and you get previews of
everything that is found within within
the actual notes you have a lot of
different tools to make your vision come
to life you could keep it as simplistic
as just drawing it all out with your pen
and perhaps a bunch of different
customizable brushes or you can take
advantage of a bunch of different tools
to help you create your information even
easier
plenty tools from table creators to even
shape plugins are available to help you
spend a little bit of time with s-snow
and you'll find it as versatile as can
be for just about anything you need to
visualize however there is kind of a new
kid on the block for creative minds and
it is called this sketchbook if s note
helps you harness the more methodical
left side of your brain with its tables
and charts the sketchbook definitely
helps you engage the more creative right
side of your brain physiology aside the
sketchbook doesn't come with as many
tools for creation as s notes and
instead focuses on the brushes and the
colors the artsy stuff really for a
blank canvas the sketchbook is great for
anything from doodles to practicing for
draw something or making full pieces of
art as you can see here I'm not all that
great with the right side of my brain
and finally we get into the crux of the
S Pen experience on the note 3 Samsung
wanted to make the S Pen even easier to
use and reach even average users so it
created the air command menu this is a
pop-up menu that is accessible by
pressing the S button while hovering
over the screen what you get are five of
what could become your most use
functions the action memo was dealt with
most in my full review because it is the
one I use the most if you remember the
quick commands menu in the note 2 this
is the much better implementation of it
basically you write whatever you need
into the pad that pops up this could be
an address or a search term or even just
a phone number and then you hit the
outline icon for link to action the memo
will automatically find your written
material and then give you a number of
functions to plug all that information
into this could be like the phone
app for plugging in the phone number you
wrote down maps for your address the web
for your search terms or even a task
list comprised of each line of written
text and of course you can just save the
actual memo for simple notes it's one of
the most versatile functions of the S
Pen on the Galaxy Note 3 and personally
I use it a lot scrapbook gives you a
powerful way of saving anything you may
come across in your note 3 life it can
clip out just about anything you outline
after selecting it but it doesn't just
save what you selected it also keeps the
contextual data or metadata so that you
can refer back to it if you need for
example find an item you want to refer
to later even if you just save the clip
from the picture or the listing it will
keep the URL and basically anything
pertinent to where and when you saved it
it's useful for one you want to save
something but the extra information can
possibly come in handy later screen
write is yet another way of saving
something you find what is most
simplistic basically it's just a
screenshot of your display that you can
write on in somewhat edit the main
difference with screen write is that
it's more of a catch-all and if it's
easier for you it will save to the
gallery for further sharing rather than
inside of the scrapbook app as Finder is
a new way of searching quite literally
everything within your phone not only
does it look through pretty much every
app for the data that you specify it
also uses the handwriting recognition so
if you wrote an action memo and saved it
you can type in one of those words and
the note will likely pop up it gives a
pretty nice interface consolidating all
of its search results also the
handwriting recognition on the note 3 is
pretty scarily accurate so the s finder
could be your gateway for finding just
about anything that you need and finally
we make it to the pen window which is
different from the other typical stylus
functions basically this is Samsung's
version of small apps draw a rectangular
shape and it will fill that area with a
small version of any apps in its list it
might be good for small multitasking but
honestly I don't use the small overlays
very much not to mention the list of the
available apps is pretty scarce
personally I'd rather jump between full
apps than try to work with a small one
that is possibly covering up my other
information and so there you have it it
should be obvious from this feature
focus that the S Pen is one of the most
versatile parts of the Galaxy Note line
and in the note 3 it is certainly at its
best
there is just so much you can do with it
and if you're the kind of person that
still loves to handwrite things like me
it's a great way to bridge the gap
between analog and digital
I find myself writing even my text
messages to people just because I find
the s-pen that much fun to use using the
pen might actually make you feel like
you're doing work
so if productivity is important to you
pop that pen out and get writing I hope
you got a lot out of this feature focus
