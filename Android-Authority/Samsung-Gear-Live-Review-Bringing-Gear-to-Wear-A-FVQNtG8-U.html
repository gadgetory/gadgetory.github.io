pretty familiar but brings a couple of
different aspects to this new SmartWatch
ecosystem hey it's Josh freghar from
Android authority and this is the
Samsung gear live as we are dealing with
another Android wear device and I
already took a look at the software in
my LG G watch review this and any
following Android wear videos are going
to basically be follow ups on the
software itself so we're going to just
go ahead and jump into the hardware as
it does bear the gear name this device
looks like the most recent offerings
from Samsung in the SmartWatch game the
gear 2 and the gear neo the watch face
looks quite bold with its metallic
lining around a large bezel that houses
the screen you get curves on the top and
bottom of the unit as the screen quite
literally rises up to meet your tabs and
presses on the side is one lone button
that currently can only be used to wake
the device or access the settings via a
hold and if you move to the bottom of
the unit you'll notice how it's curved
which is different from the flat back of
the G watch it allows it to more or less
contour to the shape of a wrist the
charging pins and the heart rate monitor
are located on the back as well whereas
you might be used to having flat and
otherwise very malleable watch bands on
other offerings the gear life has one
that is perpetually curved but luckily
is easy to put on taking a page out of
the gear fits book the watch is easily
donned via a couple pins that poke into
the secure holes on the other side and
when you have the actual SmartWatch on
it actually feels quite comfortable
despite the somewhat rigid Flair of the
gear live it sits very nicely on the
wrist and can comfortably become a
fixture of your arm one quick note about
replacing the watch band on the gear
live while it is possible I don't
imagine that it's something that you
would want to do too often because this
band is made specifically for the shape
that this watch is supposed to have and
hug around your wrist I have been seeing
some pictures online and on various
forums and on reddit of people that have
replaced it with otherwise curved bands
like metal ones that use a clasp system
now Samsung couldn't help but put their
AMOLED display on this Smart Watch
outfitting the gear live with a 1.6
3-inch 320 by 320 resolution screen
while results is quite the pleasing
display experience with the AMOLED
colors really making the con
trust this screen sport a a
higher-resolution also allows for a bit
more sharpness all around which is
easily noticed when looking at icons or
otherwise busy notification cards touch
sensitivity is about as good as it
should be on this wearable with no
problems tapping and swiping whatsoever
daylight viewing is still difficult as
was expected but moving away from the
direct rays of the Sun still brings
pretty serviceable vision the bottom
line is the display here is quite
enjoyable on the gear life and it feels
almost as if Samsung already knew the
right combination of specs for the size
that this ecosystem calls for I also
didn't have any problems with
performance as the gear live comes with
a Snapdragon 400 and half a gigabyte of
RAM it's worth mentioning again that
Android wear at its core is not
particularly intensive and thus retains
a good speed throughout even with the
many applications that I've installed on
here in the past week or so I have not
noticed any problems running
notifications running specific apps or
even when I'm playing some games the
processing package also has to run a
couple different offerings for the gear
life specifically the first of which is
the heart rate monitor I already have a
pretty set opinion on Samsung's general
heart rate monitors so aside from the
gear fit the HRMS on Samsung devices
typically aren't made for serious
fitness enthusiasts and the gear live
unfortunately is no exception I did use
it a couple times on here just out of
the sake of novelty and out of curiosity
really but aside from that unless google
fit provides a coaching apparatus of
some sort the heart rate monitor and the
gear live will announce a little more
than a tool that will collect dust the
300 million power battery of the gear
live is a little smaller than the one
found in the LG G watch and the real
world performance unfortunately reflects
that I struggle to get two days out of
the gear live even when muting
notifications when I needed to and
letting the screen go completely off
when idle charging time also didn't do
much justice as it took around two hours
for a full charge and speaking of
charging I'm still not a fan of the
charging modules that Samsung puts with
their watches not only is it a small
piece of plastic that could easily get
lost it has to snap onto the back of the
watch charging is thus a bit of a chore
and highly unflattering to what is
otherwise an actually pretty good
looking device not to mention all the
users out there that have been reporting
that their Chargers have broken quite
easily and finally as will be a motif
for all of these smartwatches
these feet
is our thankfully protected by an IP
certified body and finally in software
we revisit Android wear as I mentioned
earlier an in-depth look at this
ecosystem was already had in my LG G
watch review and other videos available
but here's the gist Android wear is a
great way of getting your notifications
and in most cases manipulating them
without having to take out your phone
despite some fundamental issues like not
being able to call back cards that
you've dismissed it gets the job done as
long as you're consistent with what you
have to do each time you get your
notification voice recognition works a
treat as I only have to repeat myself
once in a while to the watch but it
allows for not only any general wear
command but also for the dictation of
messages and texts which is great when
it's working smoothly adding
applications on top of this core
functionality is what will help make
Android wear grow and we've already seen
quite a few additions in the Play Store
replaceable watch faces have been piling
up as well as new apps for further
functionality and control music boss
thankfully has found its way to Android
wear and provides a way to start your
music and media where there previously
was none games like 2048 and tic-tac-toe
have made it onto here as well providing
some novelty and fun when used as a raw
notification engine Android wearables
are a wonderful alternative to actually
taking out your phone to check it there
are some aha moments when you look at
the deeper functionality and they are
sprinkled throughout but otherwise
Android wear has yet to really come into
its own and we're really looking forward
to the day that it does the Samsung gear
live is available for the price of 199
making it a little cheaper than the
current alternative the LG G watch and
though the G watch provides a much more
minimalistic design it does benefit from
that simplicity by being somewhat more
customizable with its flat watch band it
doesn't provide much else than a screen
that you strap on to your wrist making
the gear live and actually pretty good
value considering that on paper it does
offer a little bit more and that's the
rub thus far with the Android wear it's
an operating system made to be used on a
plethora of devices and will ultimately
feel the same no matter which one you
pick up so manufacturers can keep things
really simple and just provide a screen
for Android wear to live on or they can
try to add a little bit more to the
general experience via the hardware
Samsung did the latter providing a
heartrate monitor in
body that is a little bit more than just
a black slab is that enough to put
Android wear over the top for people
that are still on the fence probably not
the heart rate monitor currently doesn't
provide much value and though it's
screen is a pleasure to look at it's
really only a modicum better than the
alternative what Samsung has done with
the design of the gear live just shows
how much longer they've been in the
SmartWatch game with their gear series
but the onus is on Google and the
community of developers to make Android
wear really blue and until it does
you can choose Samsung's flavor of
Android wear if it's design language and
screen maybe not so much the heart rate
monitor truly speak to you as always
thank you guys very much for watching
and I hope you enjoyed this review of
the Samsung gear live compared to the LG
G watch it does provide a little bit
more in terms of design its screen and
yes it does have that heart rate monitor
but in the end Android wear is meant to
just be a tap swiping go type of
operating system on a screen that lives
on your wrist so if those extras really
do appeal to you the Samsung gear life
might be the one for you to choose we do
still have the Moto 360 coming up so
stay tuned for that and more coverage of
Android wear whether it's on this the
Moto 360 or the LG G watch we do have a
couple more things coming in the
pipeline for Android wear so keep it
