gentlemen this is Clayton young bird
coming at you from the number one
website for all things Android Android
authority calm now today we've got a
screen protector roundup for the Samsung
Galaxy s3 we've got our white model and
our pebble blue model here just to show
you what the screen protectors look like
on each we've got a plethora of screen
protectors we're gonna be checking all
of them out so without further ado let's
just see what we've got
first off we have some no-name screen
protectors here got a front and back we
will include the links to all of these
screen protectors in the description
next we've got our new clear crystal
screen film as well as our FA's 'men
screen shield we've got our spigen flex
HD non-yellowing thermoplastic urethane
film so it's going to be more of a
pliable application we've got our ring
buh ultimate clear + extra strength
screen protector we've got our V pose
screen guard for the Samsung Galaxy s3
here we've got a no-name screen
protector and then finally we've got our
armor suit protection for life military
shield for the Samsung Galaxy s3 we'll
go ahead and take out this harder
plastic one here now this is one of the
tougher plastic ones it's going to fit
over your Galaxy s3 and kind of be just
the perfect fit you know you've got to
get it on perfect anyways we'll just
make sure that our device is free of
debris and dust and then we will begin
installation looks like right here we've
got our front so we're going to be
peeling this off and then we just want
to line up the little cutouts for
everything once that is done we can work
out our air bubbles with a squeegee
credit card works too and even your
fingers if you're in a pinch no pun
intended
if anyways this looks nice it has a bit
of reflection but it still feels very
very nice of course we get our perfect
touch response nothing's really going to
hinder that as far as screen protectors
we've got our cutouts on top here for
our microphone and how these screen
protector does not go over the front
facing camera there which is a nice
feature and then we have our access to
the physical hole
button capacitive buttons are still easy
to press through the screen protector
and there you have it folks let's try
out our next one our next one is going
to be this screen protector for Sam
Galaxy s3
anyways we'll put this on justplease
peel off this mass after application is
completed
these are little cleaning cloth make
sure the screens for your debris and
we'll set that according to the physical
home button let this drop down and I'll
bring both of these side to side these
are both are no names as you can see and
will whip out our knife do some scratch
tests you can see we can actually remove
the screen protector itself the screen
protector peels up it seems like this
one is a little less resilient this will
scratch both these basically scratch
both of these we'll take them off and
see what happened to the screen now I'm
doubting anything it all happened bad to
the screen screen is still perfect of
course we just have scratches on our
screen protector there let's try this
one we're perfect there as well just as
planned anyways we'll continue
installing our screen protectors today
so here's our V post screen guard it
came with a nice little thing called
your style your pose
we got another electronics cleaning
cloth we'll wipe these down because
we're going to be getting a lot of
plastic shards around here from our
scratch tests this one applies just like
the others it's one of the harder
plastic screen protectors once again
they're not my favorite type of screen
protectors anyways this is the number
two I'm assuming this is the number one
we peel off let you install it here now
of course it's going to look a little
bit more dull that's just the nature of
the anti glare screen protector but it
does really help with the glare I'll try
and get some of the light directly right
there and opposed to just the regular
screen so you can see here the screen
will reflect
the light almost drastically and the
anti-glare is not as bad so knees we'll
set these down open up our foz min
screen protector slap that on our pebble
blue Galaxy s3
slap it on the pebble blue peel up the
secondary skin there push the bubbles
out now this one is not a glare
resistant this is just the shiny screen
protector the regular old plastic I'm
not really going to wipe all the air
bubbles out of course this one's
basically just like the other ones we do
have our anti glare on the left and then
the regular one on the right and see the
anti glare is doing a better job of
protecting us from glare obviously so
anyways let's whip out our trusty knife
see which one stands to test this time
we'll just make a cut as you can see it
put a nice huge scratch in the screen
protector because our cut right there
and then we'll try it on our anti glare
screen protector another big cut as you
can see you can compare the cuts on
there and we'll remove our anti glare
screen protector to see our screen is
100% fine perfect no scratches at all
and we will remove our regular Poznan
screen protector now also to reveal no
scratches whatsoever in the screen of
the galaxy s3 anyways let's get right
into a few more next we're going to try
it our nuclear a lot of these are kind
of just the exact same sorry if it's
getting a little but not in this guy's
so we get into the more expensive screen
protectors they're going to be a lot
better quality and you know they'll have
a lot more protection anyways another
electron is cleaning cloth another small
squeegee this one comes in a pack of two
the new clears
this one feels nice again it's hard
plastic it looks like it could be
anti-glare we'll find out after
application is completed we'll pull off
the front here and pop this one on our
pebble blue version of the galaxy s3
work out some of the air bubbles again
exactly like the rest of them exactly
like the rest I'm gonna leave the air
bubbles in because I just frankly don't
care I'm going to be cutting these
things
next we'll pop on our ring buh ultimate
clear plus we're gonna be putting that
one on our white galaxy s3 I'll set her
there on our white galaxy s3 there's
some sticky stuff in the packaging
that's getting on my fingers there's a
work some of the bubbles out before we
peel the second mask off here and we'll
peel it now this will work out the
bubbles now this one has a feel you know
it's a little bit stronger but I can
scratch it with my fingernail as you can
see just like that anyways we've got air
bubbles in each we don't care we're
cutting these things up let's make an X
so we'll cut an A into these Android
authority style got to AAA's looks like
our screen protector actually lifted up
in this area let's see if did any damage
to the galaxy s3
none whatsoever anything that the screen
protector does not stop the Gorilla
Glass will that would still always
suggest to put a screen protector on
there but as you can see we've got clean
cuts to the screen protector check this
one out our a a man that's hardcore
these galaxy s3s are turning their
battle scars this one's perfectly fine
as well for a a lot of these are just
doing great jobs protecting the Samsung
Galaxy s3 I'm really glad not all of
them might be very different from each
other but they're all doing a wonderful
job protecting the device next we're
gonna get into our bigger ones this
one's gonna be the spigen flex HD full
coverage here it is on our black matte
got some instructions another cleaning
cloth and then some spigen little tags
sir back and front so we've got two of
them so we might save one for later
anyways how you would go about
installing these is what you want to do
is make sure the screen is 100% clear of
any residue or anything like that then
you're going to grab your application
solution you're going to grab your
little screen protector just like this
you'll peel the screen protector off
these are a lot more pliable than the
other ones as you can see these are just
almost like a floppy plastic but they do
protect better peel off to make sure now
you never want to spray into this
directly on your device it's also
usually suggested you power down your
device when you do this and usually
you'd want to wait like maybe a night
also you can get these your fingers wet
with the application solution just so it
doesn't stick the screen protector now
that we're wet with the solution I'm
gonna set it on our Samsung Galaxy s3
make sure it lines up perfectly there go
ahead and use this squeegee right here
and then we'll slightly begin to work
out the solution there you're going to
want to keep a cloth very handy because
as you work the solution out it'll come
out the edges so you just want to make
sure there's a cloth there to catch the
extra liquid so it doesn't ruin your
Galaxy s3 but it's pretty safe to
install these and you're just gonna want
to work the air bubbles out on this okay
so we've got our spigen flexible HD
cover installed on there so you can see
there are some veins and stuff running
through there but it's usually
recommended to let this sit for a night
we're knife in it anyways we're going to
install our armor suit on the pebble
blue galaxy s3 and then take our knife
to these two bad boys
once we unbox this actually we can read
what's on the back so it's the nation's
leading manufacturer and distributor of
the military
your products most popular latest
electronic cell phones bah blah blah
blah let's just slap it on there we know
how we'll open this up more application
solution we're gonna use the armored
suit specific and the squeegee is just
about basically the exact same thing as
the invisible shield one is imagining
our products gonna be in here once again
another clean cloth we've got a product
this is going to be a full coverage
front and back of the device which is
really nice
mind you when you install screen
protectors like this they sometimes add
enough thickness to debilitate
now mind you when you install screen
protectors like this sometimes they add
enough thickness to actually make it so
you cannot install cases on your phone
which is a shame but you basically just
have to choose your protection so there
we go we can slap the front on the back
make sure there's nothing on the back of
this and we'll go ahead and set our
backing on there now just want to make
sure everything's lined up if it's not
perfect it doesn't really matter you
just want to make sure everything's nice
especially around your cutouts there you
can kind of float the skin on the device
just like this with its solution under
there now once we have it set firmly
around our cutouts we can just use the
squeegee and kind of work out how we're
gonna lay it on our device okay so it's
installed on our backing not the
greatest insulation job I've got a
little extra liquid under there but
we'll go ahead and just test these
scratch ability of this simply by
running a knife along there we can see
it does create a small scratch this is a
lot more resistant to side to side
swipes than the hard plastic ones where
if we cut kind of hard and even cut the
protector off and then we peel it off
you see there backing is just fine there
so we wipe this off with a little
cleaning cloth there
see we got two very very small scratches
in there but that's just about it
very nice go ahead and scratch the front
of our spigen HD now we're not gonna
scratch that hard this time just small
side to side because it does look like
these are a little more or less
resistant to cutting because we can see
from the back of that but we do have a
small small cut like that and then we'll
take it off this is how you don't
install you just grab the corner you can
peel up is installed pretty well on
there as you can see nothing at all as
far as scratches on the screen very
awesome
anyways guys that was our screen
protector video if you liked the video
comment tell us what you want to see
next go ahead and pick up some of these
screen protectors my top suggestions
would be the armored suit or the spigen
HD but all of them were great and a lot
of the lists less expensive ones work
just fine and they actually work just as
well as the spigen such as you could see
they were pretty susceptible to knife
scratches and whatnot but go ahead and
check one out for yourself guys and stay
subscribe 200 authorities YouTube later
