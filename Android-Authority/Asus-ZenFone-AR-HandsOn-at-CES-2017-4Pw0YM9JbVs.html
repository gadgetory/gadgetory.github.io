authority and we're here at CES 2017
taking a look at the second Android
smartphone that as Zeus has announced
here at their event this is the asus
zenfone AR this will be the second
commercially available tango ready
smartphone the first one of course being
the fab 2 pro by lenovo but unlike the
fab 2 pro the zenfone AR is much sleeker
looking more manageable in the hand and
a lot less bulky it's got a full metal
frame that wraps around the entire
perimeter of the phone and on the back
is a very soft leather backing that
feels extremely nice and also provides a
lot of grip also in the back is a 23
megapixel camera along with the usual
motion tracking and depth sensing camera
that is needed to run tango it does have
a fingerprint sensor but instead of
having it on the back like the zenfone 3
zoom the fingerprint sensor is on the
front of the zenfone AR which also
doubles as a home button and is also
flanked by capacitive keys if you're
still somehow not familiar with what
tango is here is a very brief
explanation tango is an augmented
reality platform created by Google and
its purpose for eyes a lot of practical
uses but can also be very entertaining
and recreational and as many use cases
can all be achieved through your tango
enabled device whether it be your
smartphone or a tablet not only does the
zenfone AR have support for Google's
tango but it also be daydream ready
right out of the box so although it's
the second tango ready smartphone it'll
actually be the first Android smartphone
with both tango and daydream support and
it has all the specs necessary in order
to do it it's got a large bright and
beautiful 5.7 inch Super AMOLED screen
with quad HD resolution a Snapdragon 820
one processor inside and it'll come with
either six gigabytes of RAM or a
whopping eight gigabytes of RAM which
will make the zenfone AR the first
smartphone to eight gigs of ram the
zenfone AR will also feature a vapor
cooling system in order to help prevent
the phone from overheating when using
its AR and vr capabilities and of course
with this being a daydream ready
smartphone it's obviously running
Android 7.0 new get but you will be
getting a Seuss's Zen UI customizations
on top of it as well you can expect to
see these zenfone AR to be released in
q2 of this year but exact pricing and
availability is still to be confirmed
the zenfone ARS definitely shaping up to
be a very interesting device especially
with both tango and daydream and it's
certainly packing a ton of power inside
so we're definitely looking forward to
checking it out even further so if you
want to see more on the zenfone AR make
sure to keep it tuned here to the
Android Authority youtube channel and
check us out on android comm for all of
our coverage on CES 2017</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
