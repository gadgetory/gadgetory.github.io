Authority and we're hanging out at the
Alcatel OneTouch booth here at Aoife
2015 and we're taking a look at one of
their latest entry-level devices this is
called the pop star and I just wanted to
quickly show it to you guys here but
starting with the design really quick
you're looking at an all plastic build
here and you can see that it has some
really nice curvatures to the back side
and along the corners as well but again
it is completely made of plastic but it
feels really nice in the hand actually
and it's also pretty good one-handed
device it's very small very compact so I
really like the one-handed usability of
this device and the cool thing about the
pop star and one of the main selling
points of this phone is actually the
back cover it's actually removable and
it comes in a variety of different
finishes that you're going to be able to
purchase for this phone so you can have
a wood back a bunch of different colored
plastic backs a denim back and other
materials like leather a bunch of really
cool stuff really cool backs that you
can get for this phone so that's
basically one of the biggest highlights
of purchasing the pop star and it's a
pretty nice value considering this is a
relatively easy device to get access to
considering the price point but just go
to over some of these specs really
quickly you're looking at a 5 inch IPS
LCD display on the front with a
resolution of 720p so 1280 by 720 and
you're looking at Android lollipop
running on here so it's a mostly stock
build of lollipop which is something
Alcatel has been really good about
lately but it does have a little bit of
customization so you'll notice that the
icons look a little bit different but
other than that it's basically pretty
much a stock version of
there's really not much else going on
with it so that should provide for some
really snappy performance so far it
actually seems pretty good as far as the
processor goes you're looking at
immediate excerpt with one gigabyte of
RAM and eight gigs of internal storage
and it also supports microSD card
expansion for up to an additional thirty
two gigabytes which you can get access
to underneath the battery cover it is a
dual SIM device as well so you have two
SIM cards running on this phone and as
far as the cameras go you're looking at
an 8 megapixel camera on the rear and a
5 megapixel camera on the front for all
of your selfies and just to go around
the device really quickly you have the
headphone jack
up top volume rockers on the right side
and power button on the left side here
and then along the bottom on the front
here you have a physical home button in
the middle and capacitive keys on the
left and right side so you have the back
key on the left and the recent app key
on the right and inside for the battery
you're looking at a two thousand
milliamp hour battery which obviously
isn't the largest battery in the world
but it should be more than enough for a
device like this especially considering
it's only a 720p screen and it's a
relatively small screen size as far as
pricing and availability is concerned
you're looking at quarter four for
Europe for a hundred nine euros for the
3G version and 129 euros for the 4G
version so it's definitely going to be
very affordable and it has a lot of
really awesome customization that goes
along with it so if you're looking for
an entry-level smartphone this might be
a pretty good one to consider but this
has been a quick look of the pop star by
Alcatel definitely stay tuned for more
of a 2015 coverage because we are your
source for all things Android and Aoife
2015
