to you by Citrix go to assist the number
one global market leader in remote
support so the public spat between
mobile executives has been heating up as
of late an HTC executive claimed that
Samsung is not in this game to make the
world a better place through mobile
technology now he claims that they're
only in it for the money can you see it
a young Korean executive sitting at his
desk shouting the Mobile World Congress
2015 arguably saw a complete role
reversal from Samsung and HTC with HTC
doing little in terms of design while
Samsung brought its a game melding glass
and metal into unibody design that is
undeniably more attractive to most than
the previous galaxy s iterations so what
does HTC think about all this while far
from a corporate statement HTC chief
marketing officer Andres moti recently
expressed his opinion in an interview
stating that Samsung is essentially in
this game only for the money in the
interview moti was asked about HTC's
position in the premium market a space
that is dominated by Apple and Samsung
moti said it is important to create a
connection between products and the
individual something HTC strives for as
for the competition the exact praised
Apple saying the company has been very
successful in connecting people to
something that's bigger than just an
electronics company further the exec
says that Apple stands for something
bigger than just a brand on the other
hand Samsung is a massive brand
enterprise that doesn't stand for
anything except profit or going to go
good now of course every company is in
it for the profit but the root point
that the executive is trying to make is
that HTC and Apple have a certain
consumer in mind a certain philosophy
that drives them for Apple this
philosophy and consumer base has helped
push them to the top for HTC they have a
loyal fan base even if their market
share is minuscule does this same
approach hold true for samsung while the
company certainly has made changes to
improve its mass appeal with the galaxy
s6 that may have an alienated some of
their
original fan base no microSD card slot
no removable battery for example now
personally I think he's right what does
samsung stand for no one really knows
now I know Samsung is polarizing for
many of you some of you are hardcore
Samsung fans and some of you are really
anti samsung but think about it
dispassionately Samsung does not own a
product in the mind yet I mean they're
spattered all over the place but the HTC
executive was not just taking aim at
Samsung they also spoke about Xiaomi a
lot of people talk about Xiaomi it's not
really our competitor I don't think
they'll ever make it to the US for a
million reasons we all know and I think
their business model has a very short
lifespan so what do you guys think is he
full of it is he bang on I'll make this
prediction in the next five years most
people who are going to buy a phone that
sub $350 is going to be a Chinese
manufacturer you heard it here I know
