Android Authority and earlier this year
a Seuss announced a new line of low-cost
Android phones called Zen phones but are
any of them actually any good let's take
a look specifically at the azuz zyne
phone 5
all right so here it is the zenfone 5
and starting with the design it's
actually a pretty good looking phone it
kind of reminds me of the HTC One m7
from last year with its slightly rounded
corners flat sides and curved back
except entirely made of plastic with the
exception of the metal accent on the
chin of the phone it's a little thick
coming in at ten point three millimeters
but the curved back makes it feel
thinner than it actually is and it feels
very solid in the hand the power and
volume keys are also very nice and
clicky and the matte finish on the back
casing makes it easy to hold while doing
a great job of detracting fingerprints
the back is removable revealing the two
SIM card slots and a microSD slot with
support up to 64 gigs the only part of
the design of this phone that I'm not
really a fan of is the thick bezels
around all sides of the display making
this phone larger than other phones with
similar display sizes like the Nexus 5
and the samsung galaxy s5
it isn't unwieldy to hold in the hand by
any means as I certainly don't have the
largest hands in the world but the size
difference definitely is noticeable on
the back towards the bottom of the phone
you're going to find a single speaker
denoted by a series of milled holes in
the back casing but it's not really as
big as it looks and you can see this one
taking the back off that the speaker
sits only on the left side so if I were
to play a song
and it sounds alright it's a pretty
average speaker it gets decently loud
without sounding tinny but honestly I
wouldn't expect too much from it on the
front of the zenfone 5 you're looking at
a 5 inch IPS display with 720p
resolution and while it doesn't hold a
candle to other more high resolution
displays on the market it's certainly
far from a bad display despite the
resolution graphics and text still look
pretty sharp viewing angles are good and
color reproduction seems pretty accurate
too but for being in an IPS display it's
a lot dimmer than I'm used to even at
maximum brightness making a little
difficult to see outdoors but other than
the brightness issue it's an overall
enjoyable display the specs on the
zenfone 5 are a little different from
what you normally see on an Android
phone as it's being powered by a
dual-core Intel Atom processor with 2
gigs of RAM with 8 or 16 gigs of
internal storage and it performs pretty
well for the most part regular everyday
tasks like swiping through home screens
web browsing and opening of apps are all
fairly smooth but I have noticed some
stability issues with certain apps
forced closing or just refusing to open
altogether it's probably nothing that
can't be fixed with a software update
but it's still annoying nonetheless
gaming on the other hand is where this
phone really struggles as games are very
slow to load and while more simplistic
games run just fine graphically
intensive games are very choppy and
laggy making them virtually unplayable
around back is an 8 megapixel shooter
with autofocus and LED flash with a
Seuss's pixel master technology and the
camera interface isn't the cleanest or
most simplistic but it does give you a
lot of control of your photos for more
serious smartphone photography the
shutter speed is a little slow but there
is a burst mode and even a turbo burst
mode which is basically burst mode but
even faster to help make up for the slow
shutter a soos also packs in a lot of
shooting modes into their camera from
basic ones like panorama HDR and night
mode to more unique features like depth
field and selfie mode making this camera
a lot of fun to use the depth of field
feature is hit or miss you'll have to
have some steady hands when taking these
shots and sometimes you can get some
very convincing depth of field but more
often than not it looks rather
artificial even if you have a clear
subject of focus I did like the HDR mode
though I thought it did a great job of
balancing out shots without being overly
aggressive most of the time you'll
probably be shooting an automatic and
overall picture quality is decent at
best you can get some great looking
shots provided the lighting conditions
are right and color reproduction looks
pretty accurate but this camera lacks
dynamic range resulting in a loss of
detail from overexposed lights and
underexposed darks the camera does have
an aperture of f28 oh so it's great for
low-light shots and if you need even
better low-light performance there's a
low light mode that actually works
surprisingly well at pulling out detail
even in almost complete darkness on the
inside the zenfone 5 is packing a 2110
milliamp hour battery and battery life
leaves a lot to be desired
I can make through a full day just fine
if I closely monitor my usage but it was
really difficult to make it through the
day if I use the camera a lot where I
played games for even just fifteen or
thirty minutes
the best screen on time that I've
managed to get so far is about 4 hours
but it typically ranges between three to
three and a half hours a seuss does
include some power saving options to
help you get the most out of your
battery which I found myself using quite
a bit especially on days where I was out
and about and didn't have a charger
closeby as far as the software is
concerned the zenfone 5 is running
Android 4.3 jelly bean with a promise of
being updated KitKat by Zeus not sure
when exactly that is going to happen but
on top of Android 4.3 is a Seuss's Zen
UI and it's got a lot of great things
going for it the first thing you'll
notice is the somewhat unique lockscreen
with its spotlight effect that follows
your finger with shortcuts to your
camera dialer text messaging and
important calendar and weather
information which are all very useful
features diving in further the Zen UI is
actually pretty clean looking and adds a
lot of extra functionality that aren't
gimmick
without taking away from the core
Android experience swiping down on the
left side of the notification shade will
take you directly to your notifications
while swiping down on the right side
will take you to your quick settings
there's also a brightness slider built
directly into the notification shade and
along with some of the more basic
toggles like Wi-Fi GPS and airplane mode
there's a lot of really useful ones like
the flashlights calculator and quick
memo but if it looks a little too
cluttered or there's some toggles that
you don't care to use as soos does give
you the option to edit and remove them
if you want a soos has also added in an
easy mode with larger icons and text
creating for a more simplistic user
experience and a glove mode if you need
that increased touch screen sensitivity
the zenfone 5 is available now for a
supposed price of $150 off contract but
if you're in the United States still be
hard-pressed to find this phone for less
than $200 as the soos has not officially
made this phone available in the US
which is kind of a bummer connectivity
wise there is no LTE but it does support
both AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile 3G bans if you're
inside the United States looking to get
one for yourself but there you have it
for the zenfone 5 for a budget
smartphone it's got a lot of good things
going for it like the solid build
quality a decent looking display and a
lot of very useful software features it
does fall short in some areas like the
performance and battery life which could
potentially be improved with future
software updates but you can expect to
win them all especially at this
particular price point but that is
pretty much it for this video hopefully
