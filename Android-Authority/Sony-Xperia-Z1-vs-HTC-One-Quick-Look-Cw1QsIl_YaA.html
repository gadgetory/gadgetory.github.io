smartphone against another of the top
smartphones in the market it's Joshua
Vergara from Android authority what's
going on everybody and here we have a
quick look at the Sony Xperia z1 versus
the HTC One if there's one thing both
these phones excel at its at being
different in their design philosophies
its tempered glass versus full aluminum
and it's nice to get a reminder of how
diverse our smartphones can get the HTC
One is the aluminum clad phone with a
very smooth back that could slip out if
you're not careful at 4.7 inches on its
screen the one did fill up all that
extra space with the front-facing
speakers contrast that with the glass
encased Xperia z1 which takes a very
rectangular flat and angled corner look
in order to bring a different look and
feel the silver power button is on the
side and the five inch screen is
actually not too hard to handle in this
case it really comes down to your a
preference and look and feel do you want
the metallic look of the HTC One or the
decisive feel of the Xperia z1s corners
and flatness either way you'll have a
great looking phone the display
situation is somewhat a battle of sizes
but the quality is high up there for
both the 4.7 inch display on the HTC One
is a Super LCD screen capable of 1080p
resolution as one of the few screens
under five inches but still 1080p it's a
great performer that brings more than
adequate levels of brightness and
vibrancy the same can be said for the
triluminos five-inch screen on the
Xperia z1 which is backed by the
x-reality engine the end result is a
display experience that is much like
holding a small sony tv both are great
performers and as you can see here both
do well under the bright lights of the
Sony booth once again the performance
section is a spec race as the Xperia z1
gets a little bit of the advantage by
getting the updated Snapdragon 800
clocked in at 2.2 gigahertz and the
updated Audrina 330 compared this to the
earlier released HTC one that has the
Snapdragon 600 clocked in at one point
seven and the Adreno 320 both perform
equally as well however even if the
Xperia Z might technically get the edge
whether you're flying through the Xperia
UI or blinkfeed I'm certain the general
user will get a great experience either
way the Xperia z1 does support
expandable memory and features a 3000
milliamp hour battery over the fixed
storage and 2300 milliamp hour battery
unit in the HTC One the
are important to both of these phones as
the HTC One touted the ultrapixels that
brought the number of megapixels down to
four but up their quality and low-light
performance well if you want much larger
pictures with around the same level of
low light quality sony is touting its G
lens that comes in at a massive 20.7
megapixels and comes with a number of
enhancements to help its performance and
while HTC might have Zoe to consolidate
your photos and videos in a nice manner
Sony opened up its camera to
downloadable app enhancements that help
you get really creative and finally in
software we look at the somewhat stock
like experience in the Xperia UI over
the addition of blinkfeed in sense both
HTC and Sony keep things pretty simple
in the big picture as the small apps and
Sony apps like the Walkman are the
additions in the z1 and then the news
and social media aggregator in blinkfeed
helps bolster the Sense UI for the most
part you'll be getting a pretty classic
Android experience either way with no
real enhancements in terms of navigation
other than the different editions that
Sony and HTC put in and so there you
have it
both of these phones managed to achieve
simplistic elegance while still being
quite different in their own rights
HTC's phone has made waves for the
company and Sony hopes that that same
trend happens with this next release for
more on the Xperia z1 stick with us here
on android authority as we bring you the
latest from Aoife in Berlin</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
