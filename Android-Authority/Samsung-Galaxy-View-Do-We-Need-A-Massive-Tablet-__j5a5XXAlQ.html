meet the Samsung view a large tablet 18
point 4 inches large it's not just big
it's bloody colossal the Samsung Galaxy
view is a mystery to many it's an 18
point 4 inch tablet with mid-range specs
and a high price tag recently one of the
writers that Engadget said what many of
us are thinking I just don't understand
why the Samsung Galaxy view exists so
exactly how big is eighteen point four
inches well this is my macbook pro it's
a very popular laptop I'm sure many of
you in the audience have it and it is 15
inches diagonally across now the Samsung
Galaxy view is another three point four
inches somewhere right about there it's
bigger than this and that's a tablet it
is so big that Samsung felt they had to
put a permanent handle on the back crazy
ridiculous maybe not now for those of
you who are new to the mobile tech
industry you may not know that when the
original Galaxy Note came out Samsung
was ridiculed and made fun of for making
such an abnormally large phone now
nowadays it's normal
Samsung won that battle they created a
new category and now almost every major
flagship is 5.2 inches or bigger but at
the time it so stood out from the 3.5
inch iPhones and the 4.3 inch Android
phones on the market it was crazy big
and it stood out but Samsung took a risk
they took the jokes they took the
slander and ridicule and created a new
category and today who dominates the
phablet category Samsung first no mine
means first in market share you see
there is a difference between taking a
risk that may fail and creating a new
category of a device and just creating
20 30 different models of a device in
the same category and just hoping
something sticks one demonstrates a lack
of vision the other one
straights smart strategy so what does
that mean for you and me Samsung is
pushing the boundaries to determine
exactly how big is too big yes
eighteen point four inches sounds
ridiculous and it may not work but then
they can scale back and try fifteen
point five inches 14 inches something's
going to work they want to be the first
in that category and win big the problem
of course is that Samsung is famous for
failing to communicate their vision of
their devices to us the consumer when
asked what the purpose was for such a
massive tablet Samsung said this the
galaxy view was envisioned by its
designers as a fun and useful tool for
everyone in the home everywhere they
live which of course means nothing but
when pressed further they did get more
specific the galaxy view excels at
showing off content and its apps are
custom-made to fit a variety of
lifestyles a cook might use it for
recipes or keeping up with shows in the
kitchen children can play games in the
living room the sports fan can take the
tablet from room to room and outside to
the grill keeping tabs on the action
without sacrificing the large screen
experience
Samsung also mentioned it can be a great
educational tool for schools and other
Institute's it's a welcome companion on
camping trips or tailgating with a
battery that can support eight hours of
video playback or use it to play music
videos at parties with speakers capable
of providing some serious sound none of
which I find very persuasive but I will
make a bold prediction here right now
today it may not be the galaxy view but
I think big tablets are going to be the
future in the next eighteen months to
two years we've got to have some way to
bridge the gap between tablet and laptop
and going big may be a possibility
what do you guys think please let me
know in the comments below I'll be
reading them now if you knew me for my
XD developer TV days you'd know that I
interviewed hundreds of successful
software developers and what became very
painfully clear is that there is a
serious gap between the theory that
computer science engineering students
learn and the practical knowledge needed
to build a great app and that's the
problem that our beloved sponsor Full
Sail University is
trying to address the mobile development
bachelor's degree program offered on
campus and online teaches students how
to develop apps and utilities through
courses that cover both iOS and Android
development all students graduate with
multiple completed software products and
the web design and development
bachelor's degree program also offered
on-campus and online teaches front-end
design and back-end development along
with coding formats programming
languages and more all students have
hands-on access to technology from day
one they receive a laptop computer at an
institutional discount along with
relevant software and tools to learn
