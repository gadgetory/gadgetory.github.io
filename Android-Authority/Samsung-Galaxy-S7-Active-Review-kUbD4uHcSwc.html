authority and for the last few years
Samsung has produced a more rugged
version of their Galaxy S flagship so it
wasn't too much of a surprise that the
galaxy s7 received the same treatment so
let's take a look at the galaxy s7
active and see exactly what their rugged
smartphone offers this year the galaxy
s7 active shares a lot of similarities
to the normal galaxy s7 and we'll talk
about what those similarities are but it
also has a lot of characteristics that
make it different so I suppose the
easiest way to talk about this phone is
to talk about what's different and
what's still the same the biggest
difference is obviously the way this
phone looks and the way it feels in the
hand compared to the regular galaxy s7
instead of an all glass and metal design
the s7 active is made of a rubberized
body that's also quite thick and
honestly a little bit bulky but that's
usually to be expected when you're
dealing with a rugged phone the corners
have been reinforced and are much
beefier compared to the rest of the
phone which makes sense as most impacts
from drops tend to occur on the corners
the rugged exterior makes the phone
military 810g shock resistant against
drops which in layman's terms means this
phone can take a pretty big beating it's
not indestructible by any means because
you can still break it if you try hard
enough but it's going to be able to
withstand your average drop better than
most other smartphones it can take a lot
more of them - which is awesome from
people who drop their phones a lot or
you just simply need a phone that isn't
so fragile the best way to describe the
s7 active is that it feels like an s7
inside of a case and it even has a front
lip to protect the screen just like you
would get with most cases the screen is
the same 5.1 inch quad HD AMOLED screen
from the regular s7 so it's super
vibrant contrast II and bright but
unlike the s7 the s7 actives display is
supposedly shatterproof up to 5 feet
drops at least according to Samsung it's
made of Gorilla Glass 4 which we know
can break so shadow resistant is
probably more appropriate term
has a plastic layer on top of the glass
to make that happen it's basically just
a screen protector and the biggest
downside to this that I wasn't really a
fan of is that it scratches super easily
another difference that you'll find on
the s7 active is the physical Hardware
buttons so instead of capacitive keys
you have real tactile buttons for
backhand recent apps and they definitely
took some getting used to I'm not going
to lie but they are very clicky and easy
to press the home button is the typical
Samsung home button but unlike last
year's s6 active you're not losing out
on the fingerprint sensor this time
around and it works just the same as it
does on the s7 so no real surprises
there the majority of the buttons and
ports like the power button mark USB
port volume rockers and the speaker are
in the exact same places as the s7 with
the exception of the headphone jack
which got moved to the top on the active
you'll also notice an extra button
sitting above the volume rockers that
Samsung calls the active key it's
completely user definable for up to
three different actions so you have your
standard short press a long press and a
double press that can set to open up any
application that you want and if you
need to set it to work when the phone is
locked which makes it even more useful
the last big difference with the s7
active and probably the most important
difference is the battery it's got a
massive 4000 milliamp hour battery
that's even larger than the s7 edges and
if you love the battery life on the s7
edge you'll love the battery life on the
s7 active even more I've used this phone
pretty heavily with a ton of gaming and
hours and hours of youtube and I still
had a hard time getting this phone to
die within the days worth of usage which
is pretty incredible and definitely not
a bad problem to have it's pretty safe
to say that the s7 active has awesome
battery life and it's probably one of
the longest lasting phones I've ever
used so I have no doubt that this phone
to get a good two days on more casual
use as far as everything else goes it's
pretty much identical to the regular s7
it has microSD card expansion for extra
storage and it's ip68 dust and water
resistance you can dunk it or submerge
it in water and it'll still work just
fine there's a Snapdragon 820 inside
with 4 gigabytes of RAM and unless
you've been living under a rock you
should already know that the s7 is a
really fast phone and performance is no
different on the ax
the camera is the same 12 megapixel
sensor with F 1.7 aperture and that
lightning-fast dual pixel autofocus so
there's no difference in picture quality
here between the active and the standard
s7 the images are sharp vibrant contrast
II and the camera performs well in
pretty much all lighting conditions you
can still double tap the home button to
launch directly into the camera and the
camera software for the most part is
pretty much the same it has all the same
features and camera modes from the s7
like selective focus and live broadcasts
but there's an aqua mode made
specifically for the s7 active that lets
you use the active key to take photos
and the volume rockers to record video
when you're using the active underwater
it's running on Android 6.0 marshmallow
with Samsung's TouchWiz so there's no
real differences here with the software
either the only problem with the
software is that because the active is
an AT&amp;amp;T exclusive it comes with a
crap-ton of bloatware from all of AT&amp;amp;T
phone services to apps like Lookout
Security the Yellow Pages and DirecTV
they aren't really trying to hide it
either because on first boot you're
greeted with a home screen full of bloat
and unfortunately none of it can be
uninstalled and that's really the
biggest downside to the s7 active I
think a lot of people really love to get
their hands on a more rugged version of
the s7 but with it being locked down to
80 not everyone is going to be able to
and you would think by now Samsung would
make this phone available on more
carriers honestly there isn't much to
not like about it it's not the prettiest
looking phone obviously so it isn't
going to be for everyone but the active
wasn't meant to be a good-looking phone
if you want a good-looking phone go for
the regular s7 or even the s7 edge but
if you want everything that the s7
offers with an exterior that can take a
lot of punishment and a long lasting
battery then the s7 active is a pretty
good choice carrier exclusivity aside as
