their developer conference f8 that they
have clear plans to read your mind and
I'm not talking figuratively now this is
one of those tech stories that is both
awesome and terrifying during Facebook's
f8 developer conference keynote this
week the company revealed plans for a
quote brain computer interface which
will be able to at least at some level
read your thoughts the technology is
being developed at Facebook building
eight division dedicated to highly
advanced tech projects beyond the likes
of augmented rally projects the company
is already working on according to The
Wall Street Journal this silent speech
interface will quote help people type
100 words a minute from their minds
about five times faster than we
currently type on our smartphones now
this will not only stand it benefit
those of us who just want to type our
emails faster but those who have some
sort of physical handicap and are unable
to do so at all apparently this function
would also work when you're not even
looking at your device I want to see how
that would work but what's exciting is
this really opens up the possibility of
yes I'm always talking about it but
wearable imagine some sort of hidden
earpiece or glasses or some sort of
thing where you can control with a voice
dictation much easier than you currently
can now I would be pretty cool did I do
this all segments with my bluetooth had
both on to talk about wearables I mean
I'm not gonna review that Oliver alright
so let's get back to our bread and
butter and talk about the leaks and
rumors surrounding the Moto G to play
another leak may have just shown what
the cheapest version of the rumored
motorola moto v2 family looks like the
unconformity z to play has made its way
onto the internet and it looks very much
like its predecessor the Moto Z play
previous leaks have revealed the two
other members of the family the Moto z2
and the Moto G to force the render was
posted by technobuffalo by an unnamed
reportedly trusted source it shows that
the home button on the Moto Z to play
has gotten a slight makeover perhaps
it's a bit more like the motorolas
budget-friendly phones like the Moto G 5
and the moto g 5 plus the render also
shows the magnetic locks on the back
which are made to hold the motor mods
accessory that motorola introduced for
the Moto Z family in 2016 the article
did not reveal any hardware specs for
the Moto G to play however the original
moto Z play has a 5.5 inch full HD
display a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625
processor 3 gigabytes of RAM and 32
gigabytes of on-board storage along with
a microSD card slot that allows you to
add up to two terabytes of additional
storage the phone also has a 16
megapixel rear camera and a 5-megapixel
front-facing shooter the most notable
feature of the Moto Z play is the large
30 510 milliamp hour battery it allows
the phone to have up to two days of
battery life with a single charge Wow
since the design of the Moto G to play
is almost identical to the original
phone we would expect to have a big
battery as well TechnoBuffalo speculates
that the date that shows up on the Moto
G to play render june eight is when the
phone might actually be officially
revealed now let's talk about what may
be HTC's new slide shipped HTC's next
flagship phone could have a similar
branding scheme and new report claims
that the phone which in the past has
been referred to as the HTC you or the
HTC ocean will in fact have the official
name of HTC you 11 you see this report
comes from ventureBeat and the noted
gadget leaker Evan Blass aka evleaks now
Blass says that the HTC u11 name is
supposed to let consumers know that this
bone is a true successor to the HTC 10
with the you showing that it is also
part of the same family of phones that
the company launched earlier this year
with the HTC you ultra now by that same
logic may also suggest that the full
name of the device be the HTC u11 vsk
mfcc for acc ultra 11 ask
10 and then designed in South Korea made
and Foxconn China so that everyone
understands the essence of this new life
now HTC has confirmed it will announce a
new phone in the youth series on May
sixteenth previous rumors claim that the
phone will have a 5.5 inch qhd display a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor 4
gigabytes of RAM with the Chinese
version getting 60 goodbye sir Ram a 12
megapixel rear camera and a 16 megapixel
front-facing shooter the most
interesting rumor but the phone is that
it's supposed to have a frame with
embedded sensors that use touch instead
of the on-screen to perform a number of
device actions which HTC is reportedly
calling edge sense hey you geeks out
