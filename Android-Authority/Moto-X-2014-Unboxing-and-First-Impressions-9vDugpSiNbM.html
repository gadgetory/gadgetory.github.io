excited for hey it's Josh magar from
Android authority what's going on
everybody and it's time to unbox and
give my first impressions on the Moto X
and here is the phone right there yes I
love me some bamboo if you want me to
like of a customized version of your
phone probably put some bamboo on it I'm
probably gonna like it that's exactly
what I got I have an inscription down
here on the bottom if you know my meet
the team video you know that my phrase
for the way that I live my life is the
next moment is only a moment to white
and I put the first half of that phrase
right here the bamboo feels quite nice
and it has a nice look over there
I also got the green trim that goes
around the logo right here and you're
seeing a close-up right now but of
course we have the metal frame that goes
all the way around but once you get to
the front that's where the things get a
little bit interesting I have the bamboo
in the back for me but I have black and
green accents on the front just to wrap
my android authority colors as we take a
look at the documentation everything
sustainably sourced you know their
mission statement and whatnot a sim tray
tool to be able to get the to be able to
get the SIM card out or to put one in
has the nice moto logo on there so
you're not mistaken which one you're
using and there you go those are the
contents of the Moto X box taking
another look at the back right here
there's no plastic for us to remove on
there but it looks really nice I'm
really impressed by just sort of the
build quality I've always wanted a
bamboo Moto X and I finally have my
chance to with this new version but of
course on the front we have the Moto X
logo this is a pure edition as I am
saying as I said already and here we go
I'm just gonna go ahead and take off the
plastic and we'll get into the setup
right now
now as far as build quality goes I have
to say the metal frame especially over
here on the sides really does a good job
of adding even more to the general build
quality and design of this particular
phone before it was just a completely
plastic foam but now having that metal
there does add a little bit of weight to
the phone but at the same time it also
adds this sort of thought that you have
a pretty sturdy phone all around and
that is the frame that separates not
only the design of the front but also
the design on the back which i think is
a brilliant move because well with the
previous Moto X I would have wanted a
white front with the bamboo back because
to me that is pretty much what the
better looking combination was but when
I looked at this on Moto maker I
realized that metal frame really does
separate the two elements and thus
you're able to have the best of both
worlds like I said already
these are Android thority colors up on
the front and then of course the bamboo
on the back now on the back I will admit
that this green lining around the Moto
logo I'm not too sure about that it does
sort of clash with what is around this
particular area but it's a very small
blemish on what is otherwise a very
attractive phone at least in my opinion
again I will worry I will reiterate from
my previous video on the Moto X that the
large Moto logo might not necessarily be
for everyone it is a dimpled design that
kind of caves in a little bit and yes it
might clash a little bit with what is
otherwise a very clean back but
nonetheless this is the configuration
that I wanted the only thing that I
really feel like when it comes to the
ergonomics is the fact that because the
sides you have that curve on the back
that allows it to sit very nicely in
your hand but the curves or rather thus
the the flatness of the sides due to the
metal construction might make it a
little bit tougher to sort of pinch when
it comes to utilizing this phone I have
had an instance already where it almost
slipped out of my hand
solely because there's very little real
estate on the sides in order for you to
really pinch and hold the phone that's
the only grab that I have it's not even
really a grab it's just something that I
noticed when I came to the ergonomics of
this one but otherwise it is a very nice
feeling and nice looking phone all
around especially when you make it look
the way that you want it to after all
you make a nice looking phone you're
gonna get a nice looking phone
now one thing that I do have to mention
is the fact that the review unit
actually arrived at the same exact time
as my personal unit and you can see them
too right here it's actually a nice
opportunity for me to show you the
different colors or the different types
of configurations that you can have when
it comes to using model maker
obviously I have my personal version on
the right side with the Android thority
colors and then on the left side over
here we have the white edition with
these silver accents but the review unit
also came with another funny little
quirk it came in bamboo as well now
you're going to notice something right
off the back here that my particular
Moto X happens to have a darker shade
that did disconcert me a little bit as
well so I called Motorola and I asked
them what the deal was well apparently
when it comes to getting different
fronts the white or the black one they
will make the shade of the wood on the
back especially when it comes to the
bamboo version a little bit darker to
blend in with the overall aesthetic of
the phone when you're going to see also
is that if we look at the two sides
right here when it comes to the metal
frame that it is a little bit darker
because as to blend in with the front
that is black and that's fine it makes
quite a bit of sense I personally would
have preferred this lighter shade of
bamboo on there but from what I can tell
these are still bamboo backings they
have the same exact feel and
characteristic so that's ok with me
still and so there you have it for this
first impression and unboxing of the
Moto X my personal moto X I'm super
excited to use because well last year's
Moto X was one of my favorite phones of
the year and now we're gonna continue
with hopefully with this one but we're
gonna find out obviously if that is the
case in my full review stay tuned to
