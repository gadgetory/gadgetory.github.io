officially get it so hopefully by now
you've seen lawns great review of the
Samsung Galaxy s6 edge she gave it a
stellar review and gave it high marks
not only for its unique build but also
for everything that was happening
underneath the surface the software has
been dialed back a little bit and the
camera experience is top-notch those are
still points that I had in my samsung
galaxy s6 the original review and lawn
basically just corroborated it and so
that the edges even though some of the
capabilities behind them may not be very
useful for a lot of you out there it
still adds to the experience but I did
get a retail version of the Samsung
Galaxy s6 edge about a week ago and I
did do an unboxing so I wanted to
present to you the unboxing and then I
will be able to give you my one week
later thoughts on D s6 edge and so here
it is the Samsung Galaxy s6 edge you're
going to notice already in the Samsung
branding and even in the box itself that
things have been changing with this new
version of the galaxy we no longer have
that restructured wood and cardboard
type of deal here this is a white
package and you'll also notice that the
logo itself for the galaxy in the past
it used to be all in uppercase but now
we have a little bit more of a dial to
back branding so I'm going to go ahead
and just sort of break the seals over on
the top and on the bottom it does say
here European SIM only but that is not
going to be an issue as I've already had
with the s6 and here comes the actual
phone itself so here is the Samsung
Galaxy s6 edge we can already see on the
sides you have the edges that go
downward into the box so obviously we're
going to need to kind of use the plastic
to lift up the phone itself so there is
the phone it does feel really nice
already and we're going to go ahead and
get that plastic off and get our first
feel of it
there you go it does feel quite nice
even with those edges we still have a
frame that is very pronounced on the
left and right sides that will allow for
a very nice grip the earbuds inside of
this package do you look to be of a
pretty high quality they're not
necessarily going to be audiophile
headphones but they do have the earbud
in eater earbud design along with a
couple of extra sleeves right here for
them and of course what is going to be
the fast charging you can already see
there it's as adaptive fast charging and
this is what will be used to get the
battery life in under half an hour to
where you need it to be if you are in an
emergency situation and of course the
microUSB charging cable right here on
the side so those are actually just the
contents of the Samsung Galaxy s6 edge
box we can go ahead and just put that
all on the side here and I will power up
the phone and pop my sim in there and it
will be the phone that I will use for
the next few days to compare it to the
s6 in particular
for all intents and purposes the screen
is just a screen it just happens to have
curves on the sides and a lot of the
functions underneath the edges like the
Notification Center or the RSS feeds
won't be triggered unless you turn them
on even the night clock which is only on
at certain times certain hours of the
day that you specify kind of come on and
just be there it's not really in your
face unless you want it to be and then
when you scroll through it really those
aren't functions that I personally have
used and I don't see too many general
users using them and what's great is
that they don't come up when you're
using the phone generally throughout the
day even the people widget is not
something that I found myself using very
often primarily because the messaging
app or messaging capability of it needed
to be used with the built-in messaging
application not really something that I
need when I have hangouts already set up
with Google Voice even then that
function that function where you have
the edge glowing when somebody calls you
from the people widget not something
that I've used really much at all
because I don't get too many calls
throughout the day anyway but it's
really in the handling of the phone that
things start to take a change because
the edges on the sides rather than just
have the blocky design of the original
Galaxy s6 which actually is not even
larger than the s6 edge by very much
probably fractions of a millimeter
honestly what happens on the s6 edge is
that the screen comes down to meet your
palm and that's where some better
handling comes in and that's something
that I just couldn't get over I thought
it was a great choice and in terms of
design this is not only an attractive
phone but those edges actually do help a
little bit with the handling the edge is
contoured to your palm when you're
trying to reach from one side to the
other and it makes this one of the
easier to handle flagships of this year
so far and even when using the screen
you have that subtle effect of all of
the scrollable elements in material
design coming from the side almost as if
they're rolling into your view just like
LAN said and his great review so those
were just my thoughts on the edges of
the s6 edge underneath the surface and
underneath the edges everything else is
still just as great as it is on the
original galaxy s6 the camera is really
top-notch and I've taken some really
great photos with it already and even
video using the OIS that's installed
underneath the software experience is
also really great it doesn't really
annoy you with a lot of tutorials and
really a lot of its capabilities are not
even there anymore from the original s4
and s5 and the ones that are there or
only there for you to trigger them much
like the night clock and the edge
features if you want them to be there
but really this is a pretty great phone
and if it wasn't for the price of
getting those edges being somewhere
between 100 to 250 dollars in some
places I would really recommend this as
the flagship phone that Samsung has put
out I still think that the Galaxy s6 is
a great phone already but if you want
something a little bit more unique the
s6 edge like one said it's probably the
phone to beat but I am just happy that
Samsung has made a huge leap forward in
both of their phones for the Galaxy S
line now I am going to do a full versus
between these two iterations of the
Galaxy S line for this year but until
then you can stay tuned to Android
authority for that and even more from
Android or 'ti including our reviews of
the s6 and the s6 edge which you can
find right over on the side and when
you're done with all of that check out
even more content from our colleagues in
Android listen to the Friday debate
podcast of which we had a double feature
this past weekend and you can head on
over to Android or D dot-com for even
more because we are your source for all
things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
