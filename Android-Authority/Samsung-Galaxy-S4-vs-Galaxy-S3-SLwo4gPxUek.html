at Samsung's presence and how it out
does Samsung's past age Java car from
Android Authority what's going on
everybody
and this is the Samsung Galaxy s4 versus
the galaxy s3 it's been no secret that
the galaxy s4 would take a lot of design
cues from its predecessor for some that
comes as a welcome return to something
familiar for example the button layout
is exactly the same and is
quintessential of the galaxy lime to
others it's a lost opportunity at
innovation because it seems like less of
a leap and more of an incremental step
and looking through both perspectives
it's clear that while both phones
especially in the same color look
amazingly alike
the s4 does manage to improve on what
the s3 started that rounded look returns
but is given flatter sides to help with
the handling the 5-inch screen makes for
smaller bezels and the entire device is
actually thinner and a little narrower
and although it is only three grams
lighter the balancing on the s4 makes it
feel nimble without sacrificing a sturdy
feel keeping the general look and
footprint of the s3 makes the s4 one of
if not the best handling 5-inch screen
device available now yes Samsung did
bring back the plastic feel and look
that most users are starting to get
tired of but on the design front this
may be the only real gripe nonetheless
the same looks happen to yield at the
same feel Samsung's Super AMOLED display
makes its return in a bigger 5-inch form
while the original 720p display brought
306 PPI and very vibrant colors to users
the s3 does the same with 1080p
resolution and 441 PPI what you get is a
very high resolution display that brings
great contrast and is very sharp on both
displays you get that very saturated
look that makes colors really pop but if
that really isn't your style
the s4 does allow you to change the
general color temperature to suit your
eyes it's no surprise that five inch
screens are this year's attraction and
Samsung did well with its upgrade
speaking of upgrades you get a very big
speed boost in the Galaxy s4
after all the excess 441 - quad core
processor has been replaced by the
Snapdragon 600 this evolution brings the
speed from 1.4 to 1.9 gigahertz and the
school
in antutu our bumped up a whole 10,000
points the mali-400 MP has also been
upgraded to the tried and true
Adreno 320 package the speed increase is
definitely felt as the s4 blazes through
its elements and multitasking 2
gigabytes of RAM is an absolute breeze
speed is really one of the s4's main
attractions but it's worth mentioning
that the s3 is still no slouch plenty of
people are still coming into the s3 for
the first time these days and are plenty
happy with the performance it goes to
show how even last year specs can still
hold up today what many people loved
about the s3 is extra offerings returns
in the s4 and then some
perhaps the plastic material choice is
getting played out but at least it
allows for the inclusion of removable
backs and underneath that back cover
lies a removable battery and expandable
memory slots since the s3 many users
have pined to see these features in many
of today's current top smartphones only
to find that either one or both are
missing this is not true for the s4 a
number of bits and pieces returned like
NFC 4s beam and the proximity sensor
that Samsung uses to trigger calls when
you bring the phone to your face for
example but the new parts of the s4
involved mostly the sensors and infrared
sensor detects waving hand movements and
a barometer slash thermometer combo
measures the general atmosphere the
screen has also been given a sensitive
layer that detects your floating finger
and treats it like an S Pen and finally
there is an IR blaster that can control
TVs and various players it's clear that
the Galaxy s3 was definitely one of last
year's best examples of great smartphone
technology but Samsung's thoughts that
make the s4 much more than that one the
extra bells and whistles don't mean as
much to you the s3 is still a great fit
with expandable memory and replaceable
batteries two features that the s4
bolsters with its new offerings speaking
of removable batteries the unit included
with the Galaxy s4 comes in at 2600
milliamp hours 500 more than the 2100
unit found in the s3 though power saving
options have largely remained the same
between both devices the larger battery
in the s4 definitely goes the distance
whereas the galaxy s3 might have sported
average to above-average longevity the S
were impressed with its ability to
easily knock out a day's worth of usage
with
no fear of needing a charge plenty of
users take advantage of spare batteries
but rest assured that the Galaxy s4 can
go the distance you may need it too now
we move onward to the cameras we might
not be seeing a major departure and the
optics accept the bump from 8 megapixels
to 13 but all of the major additions are
found within the application itself
taking cues from the Galaxy camera
samsung added in a number of new modes
to add some fun to your smartphone
photography just a few included our dual
recording which allows pictures to be
shot by both front and rear facing
cameras simultaneously and drama or
eraser modes that utilize burst shots to
add or remove elements from your frame
as far as picture quality goes you still
get the same great quality that garnered
the s3 quite a bit of praise bumped up
to a larger picture size details are
captured well and the saturation brings
vibrancy to basically any photo again if
all that the S 4 offers entices you it
will allow you to capture memories in
any which way you want otherwise the s3
is good quality pictures still make it a
capable shooter for the less demanding
photographer and finally the software
much like the plastic finish of
Samsung's phones you either love or hate
TouchWiz the UI has been around for so
long that it's colourful and bloated
elements have worn down some users
unfortunately if you're a seasoned
galaxy user the s4 brings it back with
little to no cosmetic changes I will say
though that the larger higher resolution
screen makes TouchWiz elements fit a
little better as bubbly and often overly
colorful icons proved intrusive on the
s3 the size increase of the screen does
help to somewhat alleviate this but
Samsung usually excels in software
additions and the s4 is no different
returning features include s voice and
multi window and utilizing all of the
new sensors the new flagship phone
enhances UI navigation now you can wave
your hand across the top of the device
to scroll down webpages or browse
picture galleries air view allows for
quick previews of pictures or text
messages with a floating finger and eye
detection allows for hands-free
scrolling of webpages or pausing of
videos on top of all of that our new
applications like s health which can
help you get into shape if you're a
stickler for tracking food and exercise
as I said before with the hardware but
the s3 is still an example of great
smartphone technology but the s4 aims to
be more
than that while the phone might have
more features than you may use they are
still available nonetheless and one day
you just might try them out and find
them useful or even fun we end on price
obviously the new Galaxy s4 will have a
much heavier price tag than its
predecessor unlocked the s4 is at seven
hundred US dollars while the s3 can be
found for $400 or less on contracts
however the s4 will cost you $1.99 on a
two-year plan in the US while the galaxy
s3 has sunken down as far as $50 at one
point and so there you have it I'd say
you get what you pay for but that's not
entirely the case let's say you have the
money to spare if you have the s3 then
the s4 is likely worth the upgrade and
coming back to something familiar will
garner little to no transition if coming
from somewhere else however you have a
bunch of wonderful devices to choose
from in the Android Market and the s4 is
among the very best otherwise the galaxy
s3 price is falling and as one of
Android the biggest releases ever it's a
hell of a bargain for a smartphone still
capable of pleasing its users it
certainly is still a great potential
gateway for anyone who hasn't yet come
to Android in the end it all depends on
whether or not the new features on the
galaxy s4 are worth the extra cost if
not the galaxy s3 still has quite a bit
of value and it may be sticking around
