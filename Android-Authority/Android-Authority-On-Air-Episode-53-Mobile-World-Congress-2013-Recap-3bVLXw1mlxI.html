there are Joshua Vergara and Darcy lack
of a were there tearing it up we have
tons of YouTube videos on our channel
you should check those out if you want
to see a bunch of verses as a bunch of
hands on the various different devices
as well as device reviews and everything
on on the website our whole Mobile World
Congress is a pretty in depth you and I
really like that entry on the mobile
world congress intro that's about it
yeah it's great it's a bull it's a
mobile world congress global mobile
awards bull like rushing the android
authority logo and it's awesome you
gotta check it out alright so they real
quick just for like a second Derek
aren't you just a little bit jealous
after CES aren't you just a little bit
jealous that we're not there you know I
know I'm not I had fun at CES it sounds
like you know
Oh Mobile World Congress had a lot more
goodies I would have been nice to see
some of the goodies um but you know what
hey Barcelona yeah yeah that'd be kind
of cool yeah all right yeah I'm trying
to play it down i'm jealous don't get me
wrong all right so we're gonna talk
about Mobile World Congress agra
obviously various phones and tablets in
foam pads and the with the global mobile
awards and before we get to all that
let's let's talk about some hot topic
this week Wow Mobile World Congress was
was going on we're gonna hit on some
information that came out about Google
vs samsung but before we get to that um
let's hit our normal app segment the
beginning of the show so you may have
noticed a new icon show up on your
android device this week a nice little
green google icon with a gear reminds me
of like st. Patrick's Day anyway won't
you st. Patrick's I'm coming up yeah
it's the google settings app with us and
this is from the new google play
services three-point oh that rolled out
and Google Play services three-point oh
we've had it since one point out we've
had it for a while it adds various API
search for android and and so forth so
you don't have to wait for a new version
of android to roll out so you can get
them so this latest one was a big update
for integration for Google+ um you can
now if your brand you can install apps
directly from your site you have a link
to sign in for Google+ the app
automatically downloads installs to your
device you can similar to like a
facebook sign in and a Twitter sign in
you can now sign in with Google+ as well
and it can you know steal all your data
from you know all your friends names it
doesn't know your friends circles they
specifically tell you that but we all
know all your friends names from that
circle or you can choose to not share
anybody it will know 0 your friends
names was very nice that the few apps
i've done so i'm not giving them my
friends data get down there and click
only allow this you know only still take
my information they'll take my friends
or you can create a circle with like you
know one person enter nope
and share to that circle looked a bit um
that's cool i like integration you know
me I'm a big Google+ fan I I let other
things integrate with it um well at apps
so you can now sign in to let's say for
example fancy is an app that allows you
to sign in with twitter facebook and now
you can sign in directly with your
google+ credentials so it's another more
secure experience the apps can be now
personalized when you sign in it can say
hey Derek how you doing and you know the
it's nice i like it so that is different
from the the web apps that let you sign
in with your google account already well
the google account right now will be
able to look at your your contacts would
be able to look at your email address
and see your name and so forth but this
will have access to your history your
your history API and will allow apps to
do things as on google+ if you share you
can view directly into the app such as
you know a purchase link view a product
that's somebody's sharing if somebody
shares maybe a game score you click on
the view it takes you right to the game
score something like that it it's a
writable Google+ API which the regular
Google account off doesn't allow writing
to Google Plus and this one does so it's
a writable API I guess is the long story
short so I guess my real question is
what's the purpose of having both I'm
going to assume that eventually it would
be phased out you will need both that's
just me making an assumption but why
would you have both there's there's no
need to have both now some people I saw
around the web complaining saying now
they have another icon why didn't they
just use the google or the Android
settings where your google account is
already there well that would require
new new version of android and since
they can't just push a new settings APK
to every device since every OEM
basically you know brights thorough
makes their own you have so they had to
do it this way then this is the whole
entire reason that the
services exists so they can push new
features without pushing out a whole new
version of Android really the people
should be happy as google continues to
abstract Google services in the
standalone apks that are in the market
delivered through the market it means
you're going to get a much more
consistent access layer to Google
services even if you're not running the
same version of Android if you're
running kindle if you're running you
know gingerbread or ICS or jelly bean or
even iOS you're getting the same sort of
access layer to the various cloud
services that Google provides it's all
very much it's a very modular approach
and I definitely agree with that over
having to roll it into operating system
up yeah it's good um so I mentioned a
fancy it's an app that honestly I guess
has been around for a while I honestly
never heard about it before never used
it until I said all well I can sign in
to you to this app used to just so you
could sign it with you yeah but but but
actually being attacked I got some good
out of it um I actually spoke with their
web developer actually a little back
story i'll ramble for a minute and i
like to ramble actually had an issue
with their website and like you know me
being an angry irate customer i took to
twitter google+ and yelled about it and
their developer actually contacted me
and said so we never had anybody do what
you're trying to do we fixed our bug we
like android authority here's ten ten
dollar coupons to give away your viewers
so thank you hun yeah so you guys
benefit from me finding a bug so we're
not going giving away this show I'm
actually gonna do an app review i've
been using the app a lot just playing
around with it it's going to it it is
greatest fancy it's a it's a
bolo so it's a hollow apps what you know
you say anything else right it's cool i
like it oh so yeah so pay attention the
next few days manager authority i get
some time to review the app i'm going to
post the app review and then you'll have
a chance to win ten bucks to buy
something or does it do it's a social
network it's kind of like pinterest
meets amazon affiliate program you know
that that's really the best way to put
it you can pin your own
called fancying them and you can use it
to buy and sell things and make money
with referrals which you kind of do with
Amazon it I'll go you know what how
about you find out what it is when i do
the app review yeah why don't you just
like wait like the thing that i wouldn't
understand in this is that it sounds
like something that dan wouldn't do the
same well I mean it's also something for
people that are selling things which
I've seen you know anything about
selling things all right so so moving on
engine moving on all right so so let's
talk about what we you know came here to
talk about when I'm going to talk about
things that Dan doesn't like we're gonna
talk about vs samsung Emily oh sorry
thank you yeah no we'll talk about
Mobile World Congress a little bit uh
let's let's do some some Android
ecosystem stuff here so let's talk about
Google vs samsung I this this past week
reports came out from the wall street
journal that Google was worried /
samsung and I guess that's that's
rightly so I mean Samsung is huge there
are a massive dominating force in
android so last year samsung shipped
more than 200 million devices more than
their clip the closest competitor 200
million more than the closest competitor
that's huge there's been previous
reports past many months that galaxy is
becoming a household name the people
were searching for galaxy more than
searching for android well you know that
report that doesn't mean anything to me
personally because the most popular
phone is called galaxy so you're gonna
be searching for the popular phone
you're not gonna search for android so
that's that other variants yes yeah so I
that that report i just say okay
somebody well how many people search for
the more droid instead of android yep
it's a lot colder it's so Oh owned by
Lucasfilm so so why is Google worry
could it be that some day Samsung could
come and say listen we're pushing this
much of your product we're making this
amount of mobile
money mobile advertising money we now
want a larger chunk of the change right
now they get roughly ten percent so they
could come out and say okay we want
fifteen percent twenty percent whatever
the case maybe they could demand more
money and if google says no then they
could say okay well we already have this
massive user base so we're just going to
fork Android and we're gonna do our own
thing and they could go the way of kind
of like Amazon did with the kindle line
Sam droid or or what they could do is
they can bait and switch they could get
their their Tizen you know operating
system up to snuff and then bait and
switch and call it galaxy and everybody
be like you know what and they could do
that and the average consumer probably
wouldn't really realize a lot of things
but I don't see them doing that I who
knows they think they could they could
fork Android and make it look like Tizen
tizon and eventually just use that who
knows but so so what do you guys think
should google be worried about Samsung's
dominance is this something that you
know that that Larry in the Sergey or
having nightmares about you know or is
this you know not not a big deal what
you guys think what you as long as the
devices have the Play Store and
everything that Google can make money
off of Google is a okay they're happy
about it and they make money off of it
the more devices that they can get into
people's hands that have all of google
services and chrome and are browsing the
web is a win-win for google so anyway
phone manufacturers want to change it
whether it's good or bad is good for
google yeah a lot of people kind of
ignore what google's real core business
is when it doesn't really matter
somebody uses iOS or android in any form
factor the only point that samsung
becomes a huge threat to them is a
people if if samsung gets good enough
services that actually tie them to
samsung phones and that has it become
the case because Samsung services just
honestly suck look at s voice look it
they don't have any kind of media
services or anything that can really
lock people in and you know HTC and
motorola you
to be in this exact same position they
were in a dominating position and
because Android is so interchangeable
and so hoping to competing different
types of services people can easily you
know if Samsung trips up it's nothing to
move over to a motorola HTC because if
you're in the Google ecosystem you can
migrate and not miss a beat really yeah
I think I'll a Chicago pointer it's
really too soon people haven't really
been adopting samsung samsung has been
around that long they're not that huge
for that long first of all second of all
a big selling point to Tyson is that you
can run android apps via Open Mobile
well look to google to shut that down
real quick if it becomes a problem and
the last thing I want to say about that
is if you believe that Samsung with
Tizen is somehow a bigger deal than
Google with Android and Motorola you're
crazy yeah and that'll that leads into a
very good point Nate so is that part of
the reason you know that these Google X
phone or motorola x phone rumors are
coming out is this hopefully a way for
Motorola to you know start getting back
into the market to come out with some
you know some some bombs really and
shake things up you know and hopefully
keep samsung in check well one of the
first things that Google said was we
bought Motorola for their patents and
then one of the first things they did
after that was take a motorola executive
out and put a google executive in so
they're not running them as a separate
entity and and then and then what a
month or two ago sometime in the past so
many months they a formal agreement was
reached to not use the motorola patents
to go after to go after Apple so those
patents how is that but not accurate
because that's not at all what the
agreement was they agreed to not
actively sync injunctions for people
violating their friend patents they
don't who the brown Oh after Apple
because actually under the terms of
their agreement Apple is totally
available to be sued over them and seek
injunctions because eplers refusing a
license at any rate and they've said so
in public court documents
when you refuse to take the license for
Fran patent at any rate you're still
totally liable for an injunction thank
you Dan I was under the impression that
grant adams could no longer be used
against Apple yeah there's a list of
like 14 disqualifying exceptions of
which Apple is breaching like six so
there there are some but not all of them
with regards to the X phone coming to
save the day I mean Google's always been
looking for that phone to you know get
into a lot of people's hands and they
haven't had a really haven't had one
compared to the size of Samsung I think
well nobody has compared to the size of
Samson I think that you know they cross
this up with the we bought them for
their patents to protect ourselves kind
of thing but I don't believe you know I
didn't believe it then and I don't
believe it now I think that they bought
them to have much more tighter control
over the entire spectrum from you know
supply chain to everything else all the
way down the line I think they they it
was kind of an end-around play to
Samsung they knew what they were doing
yeah I mean I think they definitely did
buy them for their patents I think that
the other stuff is more or less the
fringe benefit and the reason to buy
them for their pens and then keep them
rather than buy them for their patents
and then sell off the Corpse right yeah
would be really awesome if the x-phone
was vanilla and all the phones were
vanilla and that could be a selling
point and that could be a very very
appealing thing that you could buy
motorola phones workbook yeah and i
think you're gonna have some but yeah i
think the other thing with Samsung is
that really their their house of cards
right i mean they're hugely successful
in their selling millions of devices and
i don't mean to diminish that but
they're cheap plastic that of course
they're selling millions of them because
they're freaking 3d printing them off
the lines like they're candy right like
there she's plastic and yet they're
selling at the same price as an HTC
built phone that's made out of you know
unibody aluminum did you see a
ridiculous planned today whatever
nonsense that they had on the 1x right
click these are premium devices selling
at six hundred dollars versus Samsung's
cheap
a stick at six hundred dollars and did
you see HTC's post today on google+ they
said metal greater than plastic and then
they then it then it then they pictured
the the new HTC one that was that mean I
was a direct slamming since yeah and it
should be really I mean though it should
be those samsung phones are so flimsy
and I mean they can kind of make up for
it by saying that there's some of the
lightest phones around or really who it
was picking up a phone and thinking this
is so heavy I can't stand another day i
am all right getting to the point where
they're so like that it's uncomfortable
right like i don't feel like i'm holding
a piece of paper when I'm holding my
cell phone that'd be kind of cool
actually so what I get back on track
here you guys don't think that you
should have anything to worry about but
no but it's nice to have motor role in
your pocket to help push things along
one thing I wanted to say real quick is
that I don't and when it comes to
android I don't want to see anybody
become androids Apple I don't want to
see anybody be in the in the situation
where they're the only company that
people are looking to because that is
just going to cause everybody else to
stagnate all they have to do is kind of
hit the status quo and everybody's fine
that makes sense everybody is in good
competition people are going to keep
innovating and that's of it that makes
sense wikia that's that make sense yeah
I agree so I Mobile World Congress you
know what we're here for right so uh as
rookie said you know we didn't go this
year obviously we're here but right now
Darcy and Josh are flying back uh Josh
actually probably flying over PA right
now I talked to him a little bit ago and
he was in New York City so hey Josh wave
to you up there um anyways so phones
that there was a lot more excitement as
wokee said compared to to CES we saw the
optimus g pro we saw the lenovo k900 the
asus fonepad a Firefox OS
reference device ZTE had device and out
of all those anybody have a favorite and
favorite film they saw this week I just
want to say that it was around midnight
the other night and tarsi was messaging
me in a tizzy he is a big note to guy
and he loves that optimus g pro so
that's a scary thought I saw his review
on that he actually said that he's like
huh I might uh might be getting upgrade
soon you know yes he said it was the
best voting ever seen really absolutely
giddy it was weird so let's talk about
that so the optimus g pro is the samsung
galaxy note 2 of LG without the s pen i
mean it it looks for argument's sake it
looks exactly like it I mean the debt
down to the way the buttons are laid out
and then I mean it if to be honest with
you if you help two of the devices up
side by sides to back a few feet you'd
probably and you know cover up the logos
obviously you'd you know the rising logo
oh yeah cover up the massive verizon low
book is the gsm version you know and
you'd be like oh wow there's two
galaxies notes you know they look the
same in my opinion so the optimus g pro
comes with a 1.7 quad-core Snapdragon
600 and maybe that's why that thing
flies maybe that's why Darcy was such a
fan of it I mean it that's that that's
the step that's a same processor that's
going to be coming in the HTC One the
Snapdragon 600 so is it thinner uh
widthwise than the note 2 I think it has
less of a bezel yeah because that was
one of I I think that's one of Darcy's
compliances the note 2 is so wide what
does have a better screen it's a 1080p
screen 5.5 inch LCD and that that right
there is is a winner you know that
that's it's it's a 1080p screen yeah no
2 does not have that um it it's going to
come with Android 4.1 point2 yeah I know
android 4.2 is out but we probably won't
see a whole lot of phones come with
Android 4.2 unfortunately for a little
bit
chances r LG is gonna update it you know
quote unquote soon but it it looks like
a nice phone uh I would it looks exactly
like you know I hate to keep saying I
mean looks like TouchWiz really does
their nature you are is now it's called
nature versus to touch what's causing
well when I know LG LG's you I was
Africa that's called action or it's
called but it's it me it's a great thing
we can't remember it looks like a touch
wins but in many ways it it's a it's a
nice device it really did if you're
somebody that needs a pen and spen you
know then you're not gonna have that but
you're gonna have a better screen you're
gonna have a better processor and you
know a same roughly roughly same other
specs storage in and ram but John you
have a note to looking at this device
are you jealous don't tell me don't get
me wrong I don't it's not that uh the
hardware isn't great I just don't trust
LG g2 push that software updates right
you know I mean that that kills it for
me so you really intend to run the
native software well I mean even the
developer communities for LG just aren't
there that's very samsung to if it if LG
phone but if LG LG proves themselves
together on it if they improve on their
track track record then it would be a
device that's worth having to me but I
just don't I just don't see it out of
them yet so it's not tempting me alright
shuttle I hear LG after another device
here lenovo k900 we first saw this at
show stoppers at CES wiki and i were
there we got to we got touch it we got
to check it out and it's a massive phone
5.5 inches 1080p screen yada yada yada
and the neat thing about it you know we
they weren't really telling us a whole
lot of CES they said you know it has an
intel and there was rumors its dual core
didn't really know a whole lot i tried
talking to the intel guy and what can I
were sitting there hammering and we're
liking us why is Intel now able to use a
dual-core processor because six months
ago in Intel said Android wasn't ready
and they came back with really
some ants are basically saying Android
still not ready but our processors are
good enough to fix that is basically
what he said yeah six months ago we
couldn't hit the power footprint on dual
core and now we finally pan well
whatever they did so they did something
right because the reason the whole
reason we're mentioning this device is
because holy hell is it fast so so Darcy
slapped antutu on it it's an intel
clover trail 2 point 0 gigahertz
dual-core and hyper threading with with
hyper-threading so if you know anything
about benchmarks a lot of people do some
people don't it's scored over 25,000
which pretty much blows everything away
today now in comparison the Tegra 4 got
36,000 but Tegra 4 is a little different
architecture and it's coming from
somebody that has been in the Android
you know business a lot longer than
intel has intel this is their first you
know major foray with the dual core so
that's why is it such a big deal they're
roughly four months at least yeah so
yeah like where's the gift what is there
now well let's compare them with the
Tegra 4 that's not gonna be here until
that's we're talking about yeah oh I'm
not you're done with the Intel well the
Intel got the 2500 the Tegra 4 got 36
and Qualcomm claims that their
Snapdragon 800 it's gonna come out at
about the same time as the Tegra 4 beats
the Tegra 4 let's do SAT by second heard
from a pure Intel standpoint I'm giving
them a you know a high five you know
definitely they've come a long way it's
for having a person in the game I think
one thing that looks to be happening is
a lot of your a 15 yo like Samsung and
NVIDIA two are really lagging behind
what they initially thought they would
be able to get these chips out and Intel
is really moving at the pace that
they're getting better it becoming power
efficient a lot faster than these OEMs
forearm are getting better at making
their chipsets faster so and that makes
sense because entails making processors
for 40-some years yeah oh yeah the
cannolis and are indeed to do that
and do it correctly so right right now
Intel's competing on pretty even ground
with the process and they are due for a
completely new atom architecture and
moving down and lithography in the next
year they're on an accelerated release
there yep you know you talk about Intel
with a tick and then they talk there
about getting ready to talk yeah they
can move down process the process sighs
a lot faster than they are manufacturers
they're going to get to 40 nanometers
when arm is dropping it 20 and it's this
that's really huge for the next few
years really so we're going to talk
about some of the devices here move
along but those you that are watching
live or listening or watching later go
ahead and leave a comment let us know
what your favorite device from over
mobile world congress 2013 was was it of
tablet let us know which tablet was in
the phone let us know which phone just
we can cuddle you know see what see
what's out there and in terms of you
know what what you guys like what you
didn't like and we'll look at the
comments in a little bit and talk about
you know what do you guys think um it's
moving along with another device here
let's talk about a 7 inch phone on the
the asus fonepad is basically a nexus 7
in terms of you know sighs and look I'm
not all in Turtles but yeah the
internals aren't I mean obviously it's
an Intel processor one point two
gigahertz atom processor and you know
the Nexus Evans Tegra 3 but it looks to
me it looks like a nexus 7 so it's a
phone and if you watch a sis's promo
video about talking about they basically
said that you shouldn't have to crowd
around the phone to a tiny screen to
show you know friends and family a
picture or a video or something you know
you shouldn't have to hold or carry a
phone in your hand and then when you
want to do something bigger go grab your
tablet you should have to worry about
carrying two devices so why not use a
7-inch tablet as a film and that's how
they came up with the phone pad it's an
hspa+ device and their promo video shows
people walking around this you know
where's my Nexus 7 there it is
now walking around with a mask like this
yeah like can you hear me now you know I
mean like all night yeah blooming
Heather just to be clear you can
currently do that with an hspa+ enabled
Nexus 7 yes you can do the wachawi now
but you have to have screws IP range of
Wi-Fi yeah come on you can pull out the
zack morris phone and look like Saved by
the Bell all over again so now with the
HSPA a fossil exit seven you can do this
already with groove IP you have to use
groove IP to do that or so or another
VoIP service so and some people have
already done this it's nothing new but
that's you know the Nexus 7 is marketed
it as a tablet whereas the phone pad is
marketed as a as a phone so this is a
little different it's something that we
own no one's really done yet so I would
I want to know is if you're watching and
listening smoke signals however you're
tuning in would you walk around walk
around in the street with a 7-inch phone
up to your face or you know or do you
use bluetooth you know is it who cares
you just gonna keep your phone in your
pocket your purse you know or got its
massive so some you know some people
have smaller pockets women you know
you're not going to put this in your
pocket so what do you know you gonna do
walk around the Bluetooth gonna use it
I'm come I'm curious what you know the
average consumers are thinking of that
so cute you commented know what I want
is google glass catches on the beam of
grumpy cat like you know like in the
asus fonepad and then just be like no is
this another one of the devices that
there are only planning to sell in Asia
there Europe Asia yeah there's no plans
at this time for you know i am now that
doesn't mean that you can't buy it and
use it here on a gsm network i don't
know if the ivan looked at the radios
it's just a plus it should probably run
on t mobile but it's getting to the
point where nobody in America is gonna
sell anything that doesn't work on LTE
so it'll be interesting is so yeah let
us know will you walk down the street or
with a seven-inch seven-inch er up
I your face or will you use bluetooth or
not at all I'm waiting for the 11 inch
foam pad personally just don't do the
handle on the back of it so you can hold
it up like this but I see those
third-party they make them already go
ahead and practice now go and pull out
your nexus 10 or whatever 10 inch tablet
out and walk around you know that be
just awkward you to VoIP app on your
pixel just walk around with that thank
you i can look like an elevator and just
having that thing and just talking right
before you know what Nate there you go
do you have the LTE version of the pixel
no but I should get it and then you
should get it and then just open with
email and I can just walk around oh yeah
yeah get ghetto just gmail straight out
of the browser damn calling walk around
now they called anitha I'm doing it
buddy I'm doing it with your 100
megabytes of verizon service yes what
should a nibble to be like a woman calls
for about another gates alright so let's
move on talk about another mobile world
congress device so firefox was there uh
I love that guy his accents awesome he
has he don't remember his name but he
has red hair he is reminded me of the
Firefox logo like the whole entire time
he was talking like wait curly hair down
to here the whole time he's talking I'm
like dude this dude's perfect for
Firefox like nope joking aside so really
hope she doesn't see this sorry I hope
he does he was awesome um he you said
that the Firefox OS is going to be
targeting emerging markets where
smartphones are really expensive and
basically you could people the average
consumer can only afford a feature phone
and what Firefox wants to do is they
want to replace the feature film because
they want you to do more than play snake
and text message and they say they want
to be a cheap alternative that allows
you to do more I like pen after bada not
android you think that's what they're
going after well if that's the if
they're going for like the pseudo
feature phone like quasi smartphone
that's ba de ya or tizon tizen in terms
of once tied tins and tons of whatever
how do we say that name there you go
leave us in the copy room yes yes so in
the comments tell us how to pronounce
that please the phonetic he's in ties
and phonetically spell it out it is when
you look at the proper pronunciation for
that it's touch kiss oh my goodness
alright so what's with the tea and ends
with something so I'm so let's talk
about the grand MIMO MIMO memo from
there you go see the grand Nemo the
great memory know is those cases pads
that never exist I to the great know
from from ZTE so is yours ed if you're
from the rest of the world or Zed te if
you're Darcy Hayes the only person I've
ever heard say is no no you dude I live
closer to Canada to get advertisements
on the radio for the blackberry z10 all
the time alright so the official press
release for the Zed grand memo the ZTE
yeah it uh it said that it was a a
Snapdragon 800 processor and immediately
as soon as I saw the press release I
messaged the number one hardware God
that I know Dan Charlton I was like holy
schnikeys Dan this comes with a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 800 it's the world's first
device to have an 800 and dan just
replies no grumpy cat he's like no
nothing good that's grown at type as I
was like dan what do you mean no he said
well that's not coming out for months I
said dude it's all over the press
release it's not sampling to
manufacturers yet they certainly are
viewing a device that has it since they
can't get their hands on one so so then
being Dan he keeps telling me no you're
wrong you're wrong i said day they put
in the press release he said no it's a
it's a typo they meant to say 600 I said
ok so I'm going down through the press
release specs and I get down to the
radio and I copy and pay
Radio to Dan and I said all so I guess
it's not coming with that God radio that
was announced it's going to be every LTE
band and dances wait a second that radio
is the same radio that's in the s4 pro
hmm something doesn't jive here and then
and then the next day a couple of
actually android police reported
officially first Android please put in
22 on it and did some testing and came
back and saw that it was what Dan had
said the day before so Dan was right all
along that it was a was an s4 pro it was
funny his people actually contacted
Qualcomm and said hey so you put out an
800 and her like no no no it's a 600 and
then it turned out corporal I don't know
they just said oh no no it's just a no
native hundreds they probably not 600
yeah so yo p it was it uh is it I don't
know it was interesting their press
release also said had two gigs of ram
but it only had one gig of ram like who
is in charge of that in like he lost
that means like ridiculous so was it the
p1 of any video for having it cge is
there only signing partner for the Tegra
4 yeah this car has 20 gallons of gas
you know a capacity of 20 and you get on
the road it has to oh sorry we meant to
it was that was a typo somebody broke
towards both ran out of gas I thought it
was two gallons with like an 18 gallon
reserve or something okay so so let's
talk about some mobile world congress
tablets uh we have the asus padfone
infinity which is like the PadFone the
padfone 2 it's a phone that slaps into a
tablet shell and becomes an awesome
power than you get infinite battery life
it's it you should actually check our
review actually on youtube on that on
Darcy talked you know about like eight
or nine minutes or so with their
marketing team and you get a lot of
hands-on on the on the device a lot of
information about it it's it keeps
getting better in the beginning you know
the PadFone people complain it was kind
of big kind of bulky kind of heavy it's
been getting better and better
better and now it's up to version
infinity so that means it's good because
higher is better for 90 beats another
version now yeah yeah into cost 10
infinity and beyond you know like it's
gonna be they're gonna come out with a
pet di o the PadFone Buzz Lightyear
something just got to pick a larger
inside so uh galaxy note 8.0 we knew
that was common we heard you know it
leaked all over the place it was on
picasa where android phones go to you
know tell their tale of um anybody
thinks does anybody think it looks like
a little like a little child's toy that
you would buy in toys r us like the
child's children toy plastic Samsung
product yes no III mean more so than
they typically do it looks like a galaxy
s3 that they decided to blow up exactly
cheap plastic a much-loved and childlike
yes designed for humans as opposed to
everybody else the design things for I
don't know okay so i would think that
children would use this and since you
can use it as a phone think of it like a
three-foot kid walking around using this
as a phone that'd be crazy my you know
what I'm gonna buy one for my son are
you see him use it that would be the
funniest thing ever now dig it out take
some pictures send it back so the reason
that Samsung came out with this
everybody thinks is 8 inches is roughly
the same size as the ipad mini iPad
minis like seven point eight point nine
I don't know if we forgot the fact that
this is not the first eight something
inch tablet from samsung maybe more but
down oh I hate inch tablet this is their
new one that's why because they release
a product and then Apple releases a
similar one and then Samsung updates
their existing project from viously
samsung is ripping apple off well
they're not ripping them off but they're
competing and that's exactly what I'm
saying there that's there this is their
answer you know what their their note
line so is it awesome do you want one
yeah I not down with the whole your
country kid I was bhulaiya don't believe
in
I on air like that were under own oh so
most interesting tablet besides the the
fonepad i think was HP Slate just
because HP this is therefore a this is
their first time getting into the
officially getting into the android
market space and I think that's cool
you're getting you know the HP brand
name that everybody knows has been
making computers for years yet touchpad
might not have been the best tablet in
the planet buy laptops are not the best
laptops on the planet either you know
but it everybody you know when it comes
to HP or dell or whatever insert major
computer manufacturer here they're all
roughly the same until somebody has a
problem with them and then they hate
them and then they love another company
that that's really awful I'll tell you
why it's a bad tablet freakin look at it
compared to the Nexus 7 okay thirty
dollars more so the HP slate 7 comes in
at 169 nope it's a nexus 7 is thirty
dollars more ok so the there's no GPS no
no NFC as el gps NFC you right three
megapixel rear camera people are gonna
like the fact that as a microSD card
people a lot a lot of people hated on
the Nexus 7 because they wanted more
space as all 88 meg is to learn a gig
and you know 16 gig and so that'll be a
selling point for people that you know
what more space or want throne that you
know 64 gig and whatever um one gigabyte
of RAM yeah but then Nexus M&amp;amp;N did you
know 70 better am the evo the original
one yeah one gig does not cut it anymore
no it doesn't i think rented the Nexus 7
has one game of our amps here so oh yeah
but beautiful the Nexus 7 has 1 Giga
Ranma as I said now the screen 1024 x
600 so it's competing with the kindle
fire for the 159 ouch that's what i'm
thinking you know it's a the kindle
fires a little lower specs
better resolution than that it's a it's
a cheap tablet it's nothing more you
know and we also enjoyed for tia youtube
channel you can check out the hands on
there and first look there and it looks
like a nice device you know it it is
also running almost dark and room that
is nice if somebody another selling
point for us people it has it has Beats
Audio which why no absolutely no but
some people love it yeah so does I don't
know why but yeah some people do
consider an egg that what's gonna be in
stores where as the nexus 7 you can't
get in stores usually yeah that's a good
point well you can go pick one up at
staples or best buy yeah but nobody is a
stable there I i live in love nowhere
and i have a staples here I'm staples
are staples here I minimal if I had a
staples i would eat later regardless
yeah a selling point on this in my
opinion is the support because we know
that Google doesn't have the greatest
support are you kidding in the world
wait hundred deal with Google support my
nexus 7 it was fantastic I know dirt
didn't you have something I didn't have
a problem you can see my post an article
about it I didn't have a problem when I
replaced my nexus 7 but that doesn't
mean that I can't find thousands of
people that have complained either this
is we can't find lots of thousands of
people complaining about HP's customers
it you know it's pretty good there the
paragon of customer service real quick
I'm customer service to be honest with
you either Meg Whitman is a liar or HP
got this out really fast no shoes cause
about that long ago about how if HP came
out with the tablet soon it would be
running windows yeah and then they come
out with an android tablet and she
pretty much ruled that out i think four
months ago I they shouldn't ruled out
android too after she killed webos
mm-hmm here's like f mobile we're
sticking to windows well a year ago HP
also said we're never making another
desktop computer again and then a month
later like oh look at Greg their desktop
we made it yeah yeah they actually were
they closed down plant plants and
and they closed that whole entire
consumer division and then all of a
sudden yeah well we never really said we
were doing it forever yeah yeah we just
meant for the next month which is felt
like taking a vacation guys were truths
just only last year either way I think
that this speaks volumes for Android to
have a major device manufacturer major
pc server you know desktop manufacturer
make an Android tablet the same undergo
would say the same thing if Dell made
another android tablet samsung samsung
is a major pc vendor that makes tablets
let me know that tablets fortunately i
would consider them a major piece renovo
mixed time asus acer I wouldn't consider
view those major I think there's one of
the larger pc distributors on the planet
I think all of them are kind of dabbled
their feet in the water but it speaks
volumes for how successful android is
that they're doing this but it also
speaks volumes of how clueless HP has
been in the last couple of years to the
market because webos was not a bad
platform they just killed out with crab
really terrible partner and you know if
they don't compete there in age in the
touchpad wasn't terrible it was just
fancy and but but the pre the pre was
terrible yeah they didn't improve on
those things but I if they won't make
more getting adoption I think they have
to come over better hardware for the
money right so Scott talked about Mobile
World Congress Awards a every year they
award to best you know pretty much
there's too many categories to list them
all pretty much everything under the Sun
it has an award so let's talk about some
relevant ones here I what's go over a
little bit of history first the in 2012
best smartphone was the s2 and this year
was galaxy has three good everybody kind
of agrees upon that um whatever I mean
the consumers believe that it's the best
part yeah okay what is the one location
for best best selling or best quality
the mobile enabled the consumer
electronics device the galaxy camera
interesting
best mobile infrastructure smart LTE
network which is a product of Samsung
device device manufacturer of the year
samsung outstanding overall mobile
technology this GTOs choice was a
samsung as well so Samsung actually
walked with five awards from over World
Congress best talent in 2012 was the
ipad 2 and now it is the is use google
nexus 7 best consumer app facebook
that's wrong that's a lot now my
consumer apps scott was google maps so
that's a that's a huge change and google
maps works yeah wow maybe they use
Facebook's iOS native app and didn't
bother using androids because if
Facebook's Android one still sucks
majorly but hey hey that's a really good
point though I wonder what version they
were using well it's just me it's mobile
its Oliver I mean it's all platforms
that yeah but did they just average the
suckiness so they portable pneus of
razors all enjoyed and then they loved
it except for how crappy it is on
Android we don't if the mobile website
qualifies as an app that's pretty good
oh the last appt I'm actually really
surprised about especially for
enterprise yeah the best enterprise app
was voted to be Evernote now don't get
me wrong you can do productivity on on
Evernote so I would have assumed this
award should be called best productivity
app but best enterprise app I I did when
I think enterprise app I don't think of
Evernote I don't know I think of
something like drive would be a better
option than ever know from yeah yeah
yeah bro box is not a good job this year
to things like I mean it it's it you
know I we all know what Evernote is I
understand that you can use it for
business you can use a ver productivity
but for example consumer I I wouldn't I
wouldn't want to use Evernote for work
because it you know
but that is you use the OneNote app for
Android I just because that's an
enterprise app it is just weird so yeah
so those of you that are in the you know
your your career takes you to some
company every day that use mobile apps
let us know would you consider Evernote
to be your company's you know enterprise
best app that you use work no it's a
question to ask would you ever consider
Evernote being in the category of an
enterprise app yeah it's a concern is it
that's great better category as its
productivity app or an enterprise app
and answer that question oh if we
thought productivity app out see it's a
great product productivity app its
design grade has great functionality
yeah but it's like a super great product
it's not an enterprise exactly exactly
did it anyway I think it's perfectly
good product is not gonna cry scream all
I know is when we all when we all decide
to start a new company we're gonna start
using Evernote because it's an inter
present the best photo here so uh
besides Mobile World Congress there were
some other news floating around on the
interwebs the past few days that we
covered in android authority so the
verizon galaxy nexus the redheaded
stepchild of the nexus line is getting
an update soon in quotes air quotes on
the next six months yeah so so this
year's a verizon support rep took to
Twitter to say that it's coming soon so
this says one thing that yay the device
is gonna get another update it wasn't
forgotten but the most wondrous 1.2 is
coming well yes yeah exactly what we're
going to is coming because remember it's
for updates behind it's a GSM
counterpart you'll be awesome if it has
jumped to key lime oh my goodness that
they were completely redeem themselves
did you guys see the tweet it actually
the the the rep actually said don't
worry you know Samsung is gonna push out
the update soon huh yes
samsung doesn't risk out the update I
love how they point the finger blame to
people that yeah that's exactly why they
did it so so right now if you're mad
that you don't your Galaxy Nexus doesn't
have an update in you see Risinger
samsung phone verizon just said it's
samsung so now you can be mad at samsung
when it's not simple adopting my son's
fault in samsung has nothing to do with
it in the slightest it's Samsung's fault
that we're the only carrier in the world
that has a locked bootloader on the
galaxy s3 so don't get mad at them for
investing the development effort for
doing it to us those bastards they put
this shitty phone on our service so we
come to so moving on to other device

sedan the way a little bit of carrier
news our favorite carrier is being
awesome as usual yes so t-mobile
announced some of their financials and
in the process of doing that sort of
revealed the fact that they have
completed their LTE build outs in Kansas
City and Las Vegas it's not yet official
which is to say they're done with the
physical construction but have it
actually publicly announced it it's
there it's just not being used at all um
they're planning to have 100 million
people in the country covered by the
middle of this year 200 million people
covered by the end of the year they're
also turning on pcs that's the 1900
megahertz band hspa+ in richmond
virginia and orlando florida as of I
think those today might happen yesterday
which brings them into about 144 million
people covered by 1900 megahertz hspa+
and 225 million covered total between
pcs and the AWS and rumor has it they'll
be launching their LTE networks
officially on March 27th probably with
more than just the two cities online by
them so the question is is when will I
ever get it covered hashtag covers
better than Derek should we bring that
back out again if you know if I don't
believe the Kansas City I can get the
best here and I'm there oh oh you know
I'm hoping somebody somebody does
something around here besides verizon
but yeah that's good I like being their
footprint with their LTE role and
nobody's really expanding their
footprint with their LTE role not there
rolling out to less than their lower
levels
services yeah because that's just way it
works let's all just let's all just go
to Kansas City dude khyber t-mobile LTE
all right so uh so who here backed oh
yeah last summer there you did just
Derek okay last year so I don't even
play console games but I thought it was
neat ideas I gave 100 bucks um I'm in a
couple weeks I'm gonna be getting my
console device it they announced
actually today that they will start
shipping them March 28 does somebody
stare that's four weeks huh that's a
month it's a couple weeks that's a month
it's gonna ship in a month in that'll be
a couple of weeks from that he's saying
a couple of weeks like a couple of
cookies yes you know a couple mean a
couple of weeks like when verizon says
remember we were it's like a skip and a
hop all right whatever a few weeks is
that that is that better dan it's really
more than a few several remember Dan I
had that meet button do you I do all
right so sure I have one of those too
actually I know you used it a few weeks
ago when we did the Harlem shake you
didn't want to participate so your music
videos on your fun that's a camera
button so uh I I'm not that excited
about it not because I don't play
console games except don't but I'm not
that excited about because we've seen
something better since then we've seen a
shield on the and the PlayStation 4 yes
we're game giving now and the shield's
can be like another four months ya know
the price point the Ouya will be okay
it'll be something to get a good
perspective of for just honor bucks a
hundred bucks yeah I'm not hating that I
spent a hundred bucks on it all ma'am
it'll be you know toy for my son right
um um remember that rumor guys about
Google having their own retail stores
and everybody said all it's gonna be
great they're going to push out Nexus
devices they're going to push out you
know the chrome pixel they're going to
push out
insert this they're gonna push out
google glass cookies you're gonna
they're going to give cookies out
everybody walks in the door did you
learn those were parties so every
everybody thought it was cool and
everybody then said well this is why
they're doing and this is why it's good
yes I was a sort of the article saying
oh they're copying Apple because
obviously opening a retail store is
everything League patented idea and
nobody has ever had nobody ever comes in
it before well thank then maybe that
maybe they were afraid of the patents
because Andy Rubin actually said this
past week that nope nope nope that is
not happening the Nexus line doesn't
need a retail store and or and them but
the Nexus lime there's more to it no
what the Nexus line needs is to be able
to keep itself in stock now Nate I
remember you wrote it actually a big
article about why the Google doesn't
need retail stores well I don't think
they need them and I think they've got
some hurdles to jump over like supply
chain and some customer service issues
and by customer service issues I mean
when the nexus 4 launch that was a
complete debacle faster disaster they
shut the phone lines down and all that
kind of stuff so they do have some
hurdles to jump over I think what's
worth mentioning is andy rubin didn't
say there will not be retail stores he
says we have no plans for retail stores
so i'm going to put my lawyer hat on and
really analyze that statement we have no
plans well what our plans first of all
and then he's talking specifically about
the nexus line the store doesn't have to
be around centered around the nexus line
there's plenty of other products they
have and Google Glasses much better
served by retail environment and if you
have retail stores you can get the word
out about fiber which is a huge deal and
people need to know about that so I do I
find that they're not going to have
retail stores no I don't buy that and
Chromebooks making you think they'll
have little fiber hubs in various cities
basically which is a retail
store I think there's a lot more benefit
to having a store for Google then there
is justice sell stuff I I do agree with
that I hope you're right I I would like
to see a google store I think it would
be beneficial for you know for them
pushing their brand pushing their
products yeah well if they aren't like
old times like and you have to keep in
mind too they also denied way back when
that they had a social media entity
coming because somebody said is there
something in the word called Google
Circles and they said no we don't have
any prospect by that name well they
didn't have a product by that name I
still got google plus because there's a
service within Google+ but there is no
process so it won't be it won't be a
retail store to maybe they just won't
sell nexus devices and if it's also
everything else well I could see them
doing something like um other
manufactures do where they open sort of
sub stores within best buys and staples
that would they do that with chrome
chrome books already damaged that's wise
and we're we're in the UK and pc world
stores we don't have those here I guess
I'm like yeah I mean in in various you
know retail electronic stores I can see
them expanding that but I don't know
that they necessarily are well served by
opening their very own brick and mortar
stores why pay all that you know
physical rent mm-hmm it wouldn't online
is so much more efficient and they're
already doing an online it just the only
reason the Apple does it is to have that
service that customer service but
hopefully you make a product line up
where you don't need all that kind of
support with all the Google's online
services anyway so with chrome you're
not talking about how to do best and sun
like running around saying it just works
while having 24 hour day freaking
training sessions so people can figure
out how to make it just worked now what
one thing any Reuben didn't deny and he
didn't confirm either he just kind of
beat around the bush when he was asked
about is google launching a music
subscription service and he didn't say
no he just said well you know it's still
new service you know that a lot of
things can happen you know there's a lot
of room for growth is basically what he
said so i wouldn't say that that's a
confirmation but but furthering that
that
rumor there's been there was a report
actually music the music industry
actually came out and said google has a
huge amount of users a huge user base we
know and then there's the huge user base
of youtube if they could utilize that
basically that's dollar signs for us so
the the music industry said to be a good
idea basically said oh ah that would do
a lot better than spotify and rdio could
africa mean think about it you search a
song and you get a little you know a
card in google search and you click
download or preview the song and you got
it right next to youtube as well boom
people search things and people watch
youtube video i think about right for
right from youtube you're watching
youtube video and you realize you like
too long and you want to you want to buy
it what about the integration or
something where you can just click the
Buy button or the you can do it now
enter your playlists or starter for
later no no no like like actual like
download purchase with google wallet and
it wanted advice in the matter of two
seconds yeah now the other thing to
consider with this is that google has
already changed the paradigm with music
industry in terms of Licensing with the
most recent big labels that they had
into the play store they brokered
globalized single global licenses with
those companies rather than the sort of
industry practice up until these
particular contracts has been you make a
USA license and a Canada one and in
Europe one and you've got 47 licenses
with each distributor of of Records
google has already changed the paradigm
on that and so if they can work that out
with the rest of that that creates you
know 12 licenses that they sign with
these different companies and can then
easily distribute worldwide filter
destroyed through google com you know
we'll see what happens i think that's
daddy that's probable uh you know I
really think that they could utilize
that then the music industry and then
make it successful so so Nate you've had
