Jill Heidi the Android authority app guy
and it's about that time of the month to
round up the best new Android games that
were released in June of 2017 if you
want to check out any of these apps for
yourself you can find those links in the
video description below
Adobe scan is a new document scanner app
you can use it to scan all kinds of
documents and that includes receipts
forms images business cards and more the
images are saved as Adobe PDFs and from
there you can email them or do whatever
you need to do it also comes with
enhancement features such as cropping
rotating and there are a few white
balance presets to help make the
document look cleaner it's currently
free to use although we don't know if
it'll remain that way forever
it is pretty decent although there are a
few bugs Senate track is a movie
information app it grabs its information
from a variety of sources that includes
tracked IMDB metacritic and Rotten
Tomatoes the application helps you
discover new movies based on what you've
watched it can also keep you up to date
on new movie releases people can also
keep track of the movies that they've
seen or want to see the free version is
essentially a trial and the pro version
will unlock all of the features there
are a variety of ways to pay for the pro
version and you can even buy promo codes
for your friends and family it's rather
new but we think it's kind of neat
coloring book for creative kids is
exactly what you think it is it features
a fairly basic but easygoing coloring
book experience kids can draw and color
items with a few different tools in a
bunch of different colors additionally
you can choose from a bunch of coloring
book pages or a blank canvas in case
your kids want to draw the images are
categorized in a few different themes
and they're all kid-friendly
it's not going to blow anybody's mind
however it's also not one of those
horrible coloring book apps that asked
for a subscription it's still in beta so
do expect some bugs if you want to check
it out
Cresta log recipes is a recipe
application that encourages sharing
people moving around the application can
find a variety of recipes for a variety
of diets many of them include images and
even video to help you prepare them the
fun part is that you can add your own
recipes if you want to the application
can also help you record and upload
video and images to show people how to
make your dish it can even translate
your dish into multiple languages if you
want it to this one is in beta and thus
there are definitely bugs how
it's free to download and use so it's
hard to complain too much safe swap
admittedly isn't the most interesting
application that we've ever talked about
it does work pretty well though it
allows you to swap your face on to
somebody else's body the application
developers swear that this is good for
some actual uses you can see what you
look like in a new outfit or with a new
hairstyle it also lets you swap faces
into virtually any picture and you can
even put your head on a statue and the
application can switch the skin tone to
match the statues texture it works
really well and it's actually a lot of
fun it's also free to use Phoenix 2 is
the sequel to one of the most popular
Twitter apps ever this one features a
cleaner interface a simpler experience
and some decent features you can
customize your main page with things
like lists and save searches for quick
access and it also has themes as well as
a mute system that works for hashtags
keywords and other Twitter users it had
a few issues when we tried it out
however we expect that they'll be
patched before it's official release did
we mention that this one is in beta it's
free for now but the final release will
be a paid app Firefox focus is the
latest browser from Mozilla this one is
heavily focused on privacy it will do
all of the main browser stuff you can
surf the web download images and do the
usual stuff the browser includes ad
blocking as well as tracker blocking and
that should help webpages load a bit
faster and it should also help keep your
browsing habits a little less public the
browser also features a button that will
delete your browsing history cookies and
everything on one tap you can pair this
with a VPN and you're essentially hidden
from just about everybody it's also free
to use path guide is an interesting
application because it's a mapping app
that tracks where you walk the idea is
to help you return to a place by mapping
your steps in real time thus you can get
turn-by-turn instructions on how to
return to the entrance of a large
building or to where you parked your car
you can also share a path with friends
so they can find you in a crowded
environment it doesn't feel quite ready
for primetime just yet however it does
actually work most of the time it's
definitely an application to keep your
eye on timbre is a rare find in the
mobile apps world as an mp3 converter
and editor it's not overly powerful you
can do the basic things like cut audio
join two audio files together and
convert them into a few different codecs
you can also split audio
packs into multiple files if needed this
works great with most small form audio
we would even recommend it for basic
professional use it's not audacity
Reaper or Adobe Audition
but it's among the best apps like this
on mobile that we've seen in a long time
it's also free with no in-app purchases
or advertising wrap up smart voice
recorder is a voice recorder and that
shouldn't surprise anybody it does the
basic stuff pretty well it can record
audio uploaded to cloud storage and
share it with other apps you can also do
stuff while it's recording for instance
you can isolate important parts of the
recording and access them quickly at a
later time the application will also
process your recording and let you
search through it as well the
application is in beta so there are some
kinks that need to be worked out it did
work pretty well during our testing but
it was a bit clunky it's free to
download with no in-app purchases at
least for right now and that about does
it for this one folks don't forget to
subscribe and ring the bell to get the
latest android authority videos as soon
as we release them all of these apps are
linked up in the video description below
if you want to try out any of them for
themselves and we have more Apple is
linked up there on the screen as always
thanks for watching everybody and have a
wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
