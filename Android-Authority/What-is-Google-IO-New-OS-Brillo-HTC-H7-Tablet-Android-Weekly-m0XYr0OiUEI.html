brought to you by domain.com you know
with google i/o coming up this week it
reminds me that i have one of the
greatest jobs in the world because i get
to talk about technology that's just
around the corner and how it may change
all of our lives so much so that you
think that sometimes I might get sick of
it no I don't get too good so let's
start off with mother Google and what
exactly is google i/o google i/o is a
software developer focus conference held
annually by google at the moscone center
in san francisco california io
historically contains a lot of highly
technical discussions and sessions
focused on Google's technology like
Android chrome and Chrome OS there are a
ton of sessions and tracks for Android
developers and designers google i/o 2015
is a two-day event and there are
multiple sessions going on
simultaneously with the exception of the
keynote which is the only event in its
time slot we can also expect to hear a
bit about project ara a new intent of
things platform codenamed brillo and
possibly android pay in addition we've
heard rumors about android giving users
power to hand select individual app
permissions arm recently announced that
it will be working with google on a new
android java compiler codenamed
optimizing compiler it is unknown if it
will make it into Android M but we are
keen to find out now mother google has
been known to do some pretty crazy
things at Google i/o like having
skydivers dive into the Moscone Center
roof crazy so who knows what we can
expect this year and we have good news
for you LG fans were looking for a
mid-tier option LG has unveiled two new
smartphones under its g4 name tag the
g-force stylus and the g4 see the two
are positioned as less expensive
mid-range alternatives to the company's
latest g4 flagship the g4 is a rebranded
G stylo which has already arrived in the
US and Korea and will be available on
t-mobile later this summer the handset
features a 5.7 inch 720 display in a
quad-core processor in the LTE model
which we will assume is the same
Snapdragon 410 processor as before the
hence it also comes with one gigabyte of
ram 8 gigabytes of internal storage with
microSD card support and a room
movable 3,000 milliamp hour battery as
the name implies the handset also
supports a stylus pen for handwriting
the g4 c is a smaller version of the g4
but we hesitate to call it a mini the
handset features a 5-inch 720p display
an unspecified quad core system on a
chip and the same 1 gigabyte of ram 8
gigabytes of internal storage and
microSD card support as the j4 stylist
the hen set also comes equipped with 8
megapixel rear camera and a 5-megapixel
front-facing camera LTE data and a 2540
milliamp hour battery the g4 see comes
with metallic grey ceramic white and
shiny gold color options now according
to a new report google has its sights
set on the Internet of Things in a big
way google has already made moves into
this space before with the failed
Android home project and more recently
with several key acquisitions including
nest but now a new report from the
information suggests that Google is
getting ready to release a new platform
that will take things to a whole other
level going by the codename brillo the
new platform will supposedly debut this
week at Google i/o 2015 and is said to
embrace the lower power nature of the
Internet of Things by working with
devices offering as little as 32 or 64
megabytes of RAM reportedly brillo
development falls under the android
group which means it's likely based on
Android though we can't confirm that
just yet we do have to wonder however if
perhaps this is part of what Android M
is all about with brillo being to
Android M what Android wear currently is
to Android lollipop but to be clear the
information does suggest that brillo is
not yet a full independent operating
system so you guys remember the rumors
surrounding HTC's h7 mid-tier tablet
well we got some more goodies a week ago
rumors began to surface about a new
affordable tablet from HTC as the
company confirmed that it was quote
looking closely at entry level and
mid-tier tablets leaks had suggested
that the company was working on a 7-inch
tablet codenamed h7 and a device bearing
the same name has recently been spotted
in india's public import and export
database the shipment is listed is a
sample for research and development but
also contains a
list of specifications the h 7 tablet
supposedly features a 7-inch display 1.2
gb heard quad-core processor one
gigabyte of ram 16 gigabytes of internal
storage and space for not one but two
sim cards the h7 looks to be a budget
product unlike HTC's last effort the
high-end nexus 9 which launched last
year so in an effort to have some fun
with our comms website I asked you to
share in the comments below your own
websites or businesses and I would

i didn't want to talk about the intro
from yesterday or two days ago it's all
a bit of a blur now where i was making a
joke about men in there you know geeking
out on phones or technology and women
geeking out on shoes and that upset at
least two of you and I do sincerely
apologize for that it that was
definitely not my intention but I will
confess something that I actually have
more shoes than my wife she loves to
point out but you know she's never going
to miss on an opportunity to throw shoes
at me so we're doing that I am always
