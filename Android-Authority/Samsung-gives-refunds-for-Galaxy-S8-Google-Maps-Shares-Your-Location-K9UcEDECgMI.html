considering allowing for three-month
refunds on the Samsung Galaxy s8 no
questions asked why would they do that
the investor reports that Samsung is
considering offering customers who
purchase either the s8 or the si plus
the option of returning the device and
getting a full refund after using it for
up to three months no questions asked
that's a very generous refund policy
that goes well beyond what Samsung and
other phone makers typically offer
because after the note 7 Fiasco Samsung
wants to prove that they are very
confident in the quality and safety of
the upcoming flagship it's not clear at
least for the moment whether Samsung
plans to offer the 3-month refund policy
exclusive to South Korea or perhaps in
other markets as well now let's talk gu
--gel maps and the fact that they will
soon be rolling out sharing features
that will allow you to share your
location with friends and family but it
is a double-edged sword it has been one
of the most requested features for
google map users and it's finally coming
in the near future the company revealed
this week that an update will soon be
rolling out worldwide for both Android
and iOS versions of Google Maps that
will add a way for people to share their
current location with friends or anyone
else Google says the update will allow
people to share their location in Google
Maps by either accessing its side menu
or just by tapping the blue dot on the
map which is supposed to show where you
are currently located then you tap the
share location option and finally you
get to see which of your family friends
or other contacts you want to share your
location with but it is a double-edged
sword as a parent with a teenage
daughter I can relate to the need to
want to know where she is at all times
because let's face it I am a little bit
of a control freak
thank you very much you may go now of
course this may be practical and
convenient and even fun for you to use
with your friends there is the other
side of the sword the dark side the
point of which this technology like so
many other technologies we talk about
can be used for nefarious purposes we
can get to a point where you could go
nowhere and have no privacy you couldn't
be left alone and just be you without
having to have someone else know where
you are and what you're doing and who
you're doing it with that's the dark
side now if you are a developer or an
aspiring developer code is your world
you create it tweak it and lovingly
obsess over it so picking the right
repository management tool is super
important that's why our sponsor at
Atlassian created bitbucket bitbucket is
the git solution for professional teams
