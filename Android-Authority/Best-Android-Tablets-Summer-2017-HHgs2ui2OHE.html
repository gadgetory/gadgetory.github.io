other device throughout the day so if
you're like me and you love tablets
let's talk about your options and right
at the top of my list is the Samsung
Galaxy Tab s 3 it's one of the best
tablets you can buy right now the Galaxy
Tab s 3 sports an HDR enabled Super
AMOLED display quad speakers for stereo
audio and a battery that charges quickly
making it a true multimedia powerhouse
not only that the Tab s 3 also comes
with an S Pen that's perfect for taking
notes and drawing and this thing is
beautiful too it's designed with Samsung
Galaxy smartphones in mind with glass
services on the front and back complete
with an all metal frame around the edges
there's no denying that premium aspect
at play here
one that's further accentuated by its
felt chassis and lightweight feel all
this of course helps justify the more
premium price point it's a bit crazy
around 600 dollars but if you're in need
of a capable Android tablet the high
price point may be worth it of course
another favorite is Google's pixel see
Google surprised many of us that is 2015
Nexus event wouldn't unveil the pixel
see an in-house built tablet that's made
for productivity while it may be a tad
bit overpriced the pixel see does a lot
right here it comes with a big 10.2 inch
display a 34 point 2 watt hour battery
and 7.1 nougat all powered by Nvidia's
Tegra x1 processor and 3 gigabytes of
RAM there's quite a few decent official
accessories available for the tablet as
well like the official keyboard or folio
keyboard now we have to be honest and
say that the pixel C is a little
overpriced for what it offers but if you
have the budget it may be a good option
if now no list of best Android tablets
would be complete without talking about
the Nvidia shield did you love the
original Nvidia shield tablet well
you'll probably feel just the same about
the Nvidia shield tablet k1 its direct
successor this
specs and design are pretty much the
same on both tablets aside from the
addition of a rubberized surface next to
the speakers and brush metal lettering
on the back of the k1 nvidia has also
removed the stylus holder on the k1
which brings us to our next point the
stylus is gone
so are the charging cable and wall
adapter the big news though is that
Nvidia is trying to cut costs and they
did this by not including a stylus or
charger with that said the tablet is now
only 200 bones which makes it not only
one of the best Android tablets out
there but also one of the most
affordable be honest how often did you
use the stylus and you probably have a
box full of charger somewhere that is a
sweet deal and finally we have the
huawei media Pad m3 and it definitely
delivers on what Huawei has set out to
do create an affordable tablet with few
compromises with its compact yet sizable
8.4 inch display long lasting battery
and dual Harman Kardon speakers this
tablets name says it all from YouTube
videos to movies this is one of the best
options out there if you're looking for
a tablet to which to consume media even
though we found gaming to be somewhat
choppy at times it's capable of playing
high-end 3d games with few issues the
huawei media pad m3 offers an immersive
display great audio and long lasting
battery life and while gaming can be
somewhat choppy it is capable of playing
high-end games with few issues you know
I love my tablet so much that if you
made me choose between my tablet and my
phone I might be hard-pressed to choose
what do you think about my list let me
know in the comments below what your
favorite Android tablet is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
