and today I'm taking a look at the
Archos 10.1 g9 turbo with the 250
gigabyte hard drive let's start by
taking a look at the exterior next year
is a hard plastic it's not that most
quality materials but it works well it's
pretty solid it holds together it
doesn't creak too much or it's really
creak at all let's see what we got here
for ports we have the power button there
USB port mic port mini HDMI and a power
plug and on the bottom inside here we
got nothing on the bottom there's a
volume rocker and then again nothing on
the side I just clean and when we take a
look at the bottom we got kickstand get
that out I work swivel almost like that
what else we got there's the Archos logo
speaker 3g expansion slot and these
little feet that let the tablet kind of
balance out when I compare that to my
with my zoom you can see it moves it
doesn't and while I have that all let's
see if we can get a thickness for Paris
and on top of it yeah it's a little
thicker you know bribe can't really tell
exactly what right third thicker but
yeah I remember there's a 250 gigabyte
hard drive in there
size-wise the top bomb nah pretty
comparable the Archos is a little longer
so I decided alright
so overall you know pretty solid shell
could be a little more sturdy plastic
but that's what it is also on the back
you may notice what's missing is a
camera there some people for those I do
not I don't see the need of a rear side
camera on a tablet but there is a front
side one for Skype so that works great
and let's take a look at the software
the software is stock Ice Cream Sandwich
I runs really smooth and I as you see a
folders so it works all really well um
Ice Cream Sandwich widgets which you can
place by and if no one's I really ever
seen it waits it goes right there let's
try it again calendar that one should
give us problem there we go
see it's a very responsive no hesitation
all right let's take a look at the apps
and bloatware the bloatware it's not too
bad
anything you have can pretty much be
uninstalled the only things really can't
uninstall is the additions to ice cream
sandwich actually put a media server on
here you can disable it the video videos
apps on these I'll show you later
well let's go into settings first about
tablet we got the whole map for
processor Android 4.0 void 3 and model
number Archos 101 g9 alright so let's
take a quick look at the media software
I found this media software really
useful we don't need a downloading
third-party app support to play most
movie files I don't want plain avi mp4 s
anything like that and it loads are
really quick will sir try the Game of
Thrones just 3ds on the other test it
looks really solid alright quick audio
there we go other features you know
folder video folders I installed
yes Explorer just to set up the folder
file system but all you really do is you
plug it into your computer you drag
files to the video folder and it'll pop
up in those media programs really simple
files transferred really quick to the
tablet surprisingly quick and if it
didn't recognize the video format to be
compatible with the video software it
offered to convert it to recognizable
format that it can play which I found
really useful
let's see any of these bloatware that we
got on here
asphalt six Evernote spider-man can all
be uninstalled media server can't music
player camps right here but those are
useful you can disable those what are
the stuff I didn't like so much with
this tablet
it was slow to charge it couldn't charge
when it was turned off and the battery
life wasn't the best probably do the
hard drive that is a battery killer
regardless of what they do it is a
hybrid hard drive flash and spindle
disks but you can only do so much in the
build material like I said I could be
better it's it works it's odd it does a
job but it just doesn't have the same
feel of my zoom and then see nice stuff
I liked about this almost stock Ice
Cream Sandwich decent price $399 on new
egg that can change video software and
codecs worked great again I like the
HDMI out hook it right up to te ya mini
HDMI and it was very responsive work
fullscreen isn't the highest resolution
but it is decent quality I think it's
the same as my zoom and dad bought wraps
up my review of the Archos 10.1 g9 turbo
with the 250 gigabyte hard drive overall
I like it solid for the price it's hard
to recommend anything else in that price
range for what you get with this tablet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
