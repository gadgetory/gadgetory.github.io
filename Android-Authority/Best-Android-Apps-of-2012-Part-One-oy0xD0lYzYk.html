authority calm and today I'm showing you
a 25 app roundup of the best apps for
2012 we've compiled these apps from all
the way across the spectrum from games
to utilities and stuff that'll make your
day easier so without further ado let's
check out the first one and it is cut
the rope now this is one of the top
downloaded games in the android market
so we'll just let this load up really
quick I know this of course was ported
over from the iOS platform but we'll
just do one level like this so you can
see this is the first level and the
point of the game is to feed the little
monster here the candy that drops down
and in order to do that you must cut the
proper rope to collect the star and then
he will be fed but I did miss 1000 man
and you see I lost anyways you can go
back and this is a paid app go back to
the main menu and see all of the levels
we get when we buy the app you can see
there excuse me there are about 13 or 14
levels per world and so far we have four
five six seven eight nine ten eleven
worlds and new levels coming soon so you
see there's a little banner ad so you
don't get the full functionality of a
usual paid app but it's still very
awesome you can go to the options sounds
music credits + reset game so that's the
cut the rope app check that out if you
want to spend hours upon hours playing
games ok guys so this is the Vox or app
I was actually able to log in with my
facebook but it would give you a full
list of my friends and their numbers so
I'm not going to show you that anyways
this is a walkie talkie app that you can
use to communicate without using your
minutes um via this app through anyone
who has an iPhone or an Android device
now what you're going to do is enter
your email or password login with
Facebook and then you can send voice
messages you just click the record
button and send your message via voice
all the way
over to your friend and then they're
going to get your message at some point
and send one back to you so this is a
very cool communication app and it's
free in the market very popular anyways
we'll head on to speedtest.net this is a
great one if you want to test how fast
your Wi-Fi or 3G 4G network is actually
giving you internet so you're just going
to agree to that and you can begin a
test as you see i'm only running on 3g
in my area right now so we'll just see
how fast we're actually getting the
internet uh we're getting about 1.4 1.5
meg and that's not terrible it's
actually pretty good for 3g that's what
you could expect 4G I've gotten speeds
all the way up to about 17 mag in
Seattle so that was pretty awesome this
will just give you a good idea of how
fast you can upload a file or download
one in case you're in a pinch and you
don't really have the time to do it you
want to know if you can do it in time
whoops take a minute to run these tests
so we just got to keep the screen alive
so anyways we have our results we have
the pain we have our download speed in
our upload speed we can go to tools we
can set up how to display the speed in
kilobytes per second Meg's we can sort
our history down or up we can change the
graphics so they're smoother we have
better performance anyways we can change
our server we can see all of our results
if I would have done multiple tests we
could see them all listed it on listed
down here and we have the about the
developer right here alright so the next
app on our list is gifboom now what this
actually does is allows you to create a
profile on their server where you can
upload your gif animations now what
those are are a bunch of pictures
compiled into basically what is a video
that is saved in a picture format so I'm
sure you all seen them online and the
one I made right here is nothing special
just a very quick demo to show you what
you can actually make but it just loads
up the gifts you made you'll need to
make an account and this is a gif of me
doing about three images across my
keyboard nothing special of course but
you can create some pretty amazing gifts
on here now once you create a gift you
can upload them and to their server you
also have news and you can follow people
who make gifts these are the popular
gifts you can see it's a pretty bloated
with people who just like to take gifts
of themselves young kids anyways there's
your popular gifts if
into that your news basically will just
show feeds people that you were
following or news about you and then
here's your profile where you can find
your Facebook friends that are using
gifboom Twitter your address book and
friends by name all the different
profile settings and then some more
stuff here now anyways this is a great
app if you have a good camera it's
pretty fun and it's pretty functional if
you actually want to make gifts for
maybe a forum or something or an avatar
you're using online anyways we'll go
back and go on to our next app which is
Shazam now what Sam does is it actually
identifies music that is playing in your
area and it tags it to tell you who the
artist is and what the song is now I'll
just go ahead and play something here
and we will use shazam to tag it and see
what it is playing now first off this is
your tagging menu where you're going to
click on the big Shazam button so it can
actually tell you what's playing you can
go to my tags to show you all the stuff
that you've played before and go to the
chart which is a basically a top 40
chart for all sorts of stuff in the top
tags and then your friends that are
using Shazam if you want to connect to
Facebook so without further ado I will
just play a song and we will touch the
stream and it got it so what I was
actually trying to do is play something
that I didn't think it would get this is
a Adam Sandler's comedy record but it
actually tagged it the excited
southerner gets pulled over anyways once
you've actually tagged in mp3 you can
share it listen to the entire album I
don't know why it says train it must
have missed tagged that can go to the
YouTube video as one Spotify all this
other great stuff and also what you can
do with Shazam is there's a lot of
commercials coming out these days where
you can just Shazam the commercial audio
and it will send you to the website of
whoever's advertising their product
great so anyways we'll go back on to our
next app which is the light flow app now
this is an app for anyone with a Galaxy
Nexus or an LED on their phone and what
this is going to do is
change the notification color to
whenever you get a you know notification
to whatever color you want it so you can
see that you have a missed call or text
or something you need to check anyways
we'll turn light flow on this is
actually going to install some what if
it's a system app because you're going
to have to enable it in the system and
configure what the light is for every
type of notification so you see for miss
call we have a red calendar reminders we
have yellow email now for all these
different things you can choose the
profile as well such as if you want it
to vibrate or what to do when the text
message comes now uh this is going to
change we'll see we'll just click that
and you have to be rooted for this app
if you didn't notice I have to run on my
alum I superuser permissions to let me
use this app now anyways we have our
notification color here and we can
change it to sky blue and we can enable
a sound if we want and we can enable
vibrate if we want and we can test our
notification I'll test it right here
just to show you what it look like ok
guys so as you can see what I actually
did was send myself a text message to
get the notification light to come up
and as you can see there it's flashing
purple and now that we have our texts we
have set our rate that it pulses you can
see it's pulsating a nice purple right
here because that's what I have said for
my notification color anyways I showed
all the settings of the LED control
there
and we'll go on to our next appt which
is SMS popup now this is going to do the
sort of thing that handcent sms does if
any of you guys have that installed so
let's accept the agreement and enable
SMS popup and our notifications as well
as well as additional settings preset
and you can donate to it now what it's
going to do is when you get an SMS it
will actually pop up with the SMS on
this okay so what I did is send another
SMS to myself to test the SMS popup
notification that I'll get when i
receive a text now we'll just wait a
second and you can see that it brought
this up um this is me set myself a nice
little SMS there anyways and you can
delete it right from here or reply it
works nicely it has a nice ice cream
sandwich user interface</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
