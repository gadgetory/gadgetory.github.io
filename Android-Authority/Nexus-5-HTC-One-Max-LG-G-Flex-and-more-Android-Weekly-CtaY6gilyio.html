brought to you by carbonite go to
carbonite.com and use the promo code
authority for a free trial another week
another round of Nexus 5 leaks and
rumors and we're starting to question
whether or not they're all as random as
we initially thought hey Josh lagarde
manager Authority what's going on
everybody and it's time for another dose
of the week's top Android news it's
android weekly we start off with a new
custom rom that is now out in the wild
omnirom was officially announced at the
big Android BBQ it brings together
elements from a number of well-known
developers including chain fire and
explode wild it has its own versions of
multi window and other multitasking
abilities is pretty customizable and has
flippable quick settings currently it
will be available for devices like the
nexus for the nexus 7 the xperia z and
even the xperia tablet z stay tuned for
an in-depth look at omnirom soon but the
release is available for viewing at
android authority calm our next story
deals with the new curved screens craze
and deals with LG whose press render of
the g flex was just released there isn't
a whole lot of information regarding
this phone other than its nice curve
that goes from top to bottom but we can
expect it to have the best and current
processing power well we can discern
from the press render is that the button
layout is probably going to be similar
to the one from the LG g2 where all of
the buttons were on the back we're
excited to see what features this new
phone by LG will bring especially in
comparison to Samsung's own offering the
galaxy round ok it's time are you ready
here are all of the Nexus 5 rumors and
leaks I came to this past week in what
can only be explained as either a mishap
by someone over at the Play Store or a
brilliant stroke at fueling the fire the
Nexus 5 was spotted at the google play
store for the price of three hundred
forty nine dollars it seems someone hit
the publish button a little too early
allowing the internet to screenshot the
hell out of the listing and bring us the
information that we've been waiting for
it doesn't list the storage option off
of the bat but the placeholder URL does
state that this is a 16 gigabyte version
this comes after some substantial leaks
from people who apparently
had the Nexus 5 in their hands for at
least a little while 1 gallery shows the
phone in the hand not really revealing
too much but further showing us what the
upcoming smartphone will look like we
got a better look at the installed
operating system as the folks over at
ZDNet put up a gallery of screenshots
one interesting bit is the Easter egg
press the android version enough and it
will bring up android in a kit kat esque
logo though the software is still shown
as key lime pie other features like the
cloud printing and the tap and pay
ability are also shown in these pictures
and if you were lamenting over the
release schedule for the elusive white
Nexus 4 you may not have to wait as long
when it comes to the Nexus 5 another
leaked shot comes from a Korean site and
shows off the Nexus 5 box it looks
pretty much like any other Google box
but on the side you see the phone is in
white and from the looks of it the white
color is only going to be on the back
and the front and sides will remain
black but from what we already saw in
the box the phone is already looking
pretty damn good now the Nexus 5 is
definitely not a secret anymore so the
question now is when are we going to get
our hands on it according to a couple
sources the 16 and 32 gigabyte versions
of the Nexus 5 will be available by the
end of October this is a very
interesting prospect considering there
is an event on October 24 that invites
have already been sent out for though we
don't know if hardware will actually be
shown at that event it should be no
surprise that we're definitely excited
to finally get our hands on the Nexus 5
and when that happens hopefully within
the next couple weeks we'll have all of
the coverage of it here on android
authority so you stay tuned all right
let's move on from the rumors and talk
about a device that was at first a rumor
but then became truth the HTC One max
yes essentially it's a mixture of the
HTC One and it's mini version using the
aluminum material but also adopting the
white lining this newly official phone
comes in at a very big five point nine
inches and features a fingerprint
scanner on the back though the back
cover is apparently removable everything
in it is replaceable except for the
battery which is fixed inside of it
however if the Snapdragon 600 two
gigabytes of ram and an updated sense
5.5 in the US the one max will be on
verizon and sprint by the end of the
while our coverage of the one max is
only starting we do already have it by
the numbers comparison available at the
website make sure you head on over to
android authority com to check it out
and to see the one max put up against
big contenders like the Galaxy Note 3
and even the Oppo n1 alright so we're
going to end on a somewhat brand new
rumor that actually isn't all that new
rumors are resurfacing that Amazon is
working on its own smartphone offering a
report states outright that HTC has
partnered up with Amazon to develop a
whole new range of devices now don't get
too excited as the same report states
that Amazon will definitely not have
them ready for release this year or
perhaps not at all it's entirely
possible that they will cancel them
altogether if the plans happen to fall
through it's an interesting development
because HTC is part of the open handset
alliance which basically means they
can't fork Android themselves nor can
they support any companies that would do
so and if they did support them like
Amazon then they could lose access to
the google apps but anyway when it comes
to this particular smartphone if for
whatever reason you're still not an
Amazon Prime member you may not be able
to get your hands on it now Bloomberg is
in the mix with these reports and they
state that while the smartphone range is
definitely in the works it will only be
sold to prime subscribers since the bulk
of Amazon's Cloud media is made for
prime some exclusivity could make a
little sense the best case scenario is
for users who use the media service
perhaps a subsidy would help make the
HTC / Amazon phone even more affordable
so tell us what you think about the
supposed hamazon phone in the comments
below and so there you have it for this
