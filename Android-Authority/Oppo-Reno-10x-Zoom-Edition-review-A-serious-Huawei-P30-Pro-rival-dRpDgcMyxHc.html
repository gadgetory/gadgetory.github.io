Andrew Authority and today I wanted to
give you guys some thoughts on the Oppo
Reno 10x zoom edition and with the hole
10x zoom moniker the main highlight of
this phone is obviously the cameras so
that's where we're gonna start it's got
a triple camera setup that's similar to
the Huawei P 30 Pro and I would say this
is probably a pretty solid contender to
the p30 Pro at least in terms of the
camera the main camera is the 48
megapixel Sony IMX that's being used in
a lot of other smartphones like the
oneplus 7 pro honor 20 pro zenfone 6 a
bunch of smartphones are using the
sensor because it's a great sensor it's
being paired with a wide-angle camera
and a 13 megapixel telephoto camera the
telephoto camera is very similar in
construction to the one found on the p30
pro it's a sensor that is stacked
sideways and uses a prism to refract
light into the sensor one thing that I
thought was kind of strange with this
lens is that the optical zoom happens at
5x but the camera app doesn't give you a
5x preset zoom option instead your
options on the telephoto lens are 6 X +
10 X which are both hybrid zooms if you
want to take shots at 5x you have to
dial it in manually you also have the
ability to zoom all the way up to 60 X
but anything beyond 10x is purely
digital at that point and I don't think
you will really ever end up using this
all that often because the image quality
at such a high magnification isn't great
and it's actually really hard to frame
stuff at such a deep zoom image quality
in general though is really good colors
aren't too overly saturated or vibrant
dynamic range is pretty solid and there
is tons and tons of detail the 6 X zoom
photos are still tack sharp and crisp
and even a 10x zoom there's still plenty
of detail you do notice a slight amount
of degradation but it's really not that
bad at all it's really impressive how
far something can be and you're still
able to capture a clearer picture of it
even a sign that's like several blocks
down the opposite end of a street it's
still easily readable with this camera
low-light is also pretty good with this
camera especially if you use the ultra
night mode
this uses a combination of a
HDR and multi-frame noise-reduction to
produce an image that's brighter with
wider dynamic range it's pretty easy to
spot the difference the images are
noticeably brighter with night mode on
and you get significantly more detail in
highlights and shadows it also only
takes a couple of seconds to capture a
night mode photo so it's definitely
worth using anytime you get the chance
the best part about this camera is
really just the versatility there's a
lot that you can do with such a wide
focal range and this camera just makes
it that much easier to get the perfect
shot regardless of how far or close you
are to the subject we all know that it
takes more than just a good camera to
make a good phone but it's pretty safe
to say that the Oppo Reno 10x zoom
performs well in other areas too it's
got the latest Snapdragon a 55 with
plenty of RAM so there's no problems
with performance here it's very fast and
responsive and it's a pretty solid
device for gaming purposes - battery
life is also really good I can get
through two full days on a single charge
with around 50% left going into the
second day I'd show you screen on time
numbers but color OS for some reason
doesn't make that easy
so these screen grabs of my app usage
are the best that I can do the phone
also has a big bright beautiful OLED
panel with no notch or hole punch and
this is achieved in two ways one it's
using a pop-up selfie camera but it's a
little different than your average
pop-up camera this has been dubbed the
shark fin pop-up because of its shape
and aside from just looking different it
does have some practicality to it
because it's a little bigger than most
other camera pop ups it's got extra room
to house an earpiece a front-facing
flash and a rear-facing flash the camera
inside the pop-up is a 16 megapixel
camera and it's pretty good for selfies
I like it a lot better than other selfie
cameras simply because it doesn't over
soften your skin and skin tones are also
pretty natural the second thing that
Oppo has done to achieve a screen with
no notch or hole punch is by using an in
display fingerprint sensor it started
off pretty rough for this technology but
I think it's gotten much better on more
recent devices the one on the reno feels
extremely quick and also very reliable
nine times out of ten at
box on the first attempt and I would say
this one is every bit as good as a
conventional fingerprint sensor now
every phone has its flaws and the Opel
Reno is no different it doesn't have a
headphone jack just in case you're
wondering it also doesn't have wireless
charging and because it has a mechanical
moving part it's also not IP rated
against water and dust if any of those
features are deal-breakers you're better
off exploring other options like the
Galaxy S 10 or LG G 8 if those features
don't matter and you really like cameras
the Oppo Reno 10x zoom is a really solid
choice it's available in select regions
like China Europe and India don't expect
it to come to the US though because Opel
phones usually never do
anyways that's pretty much gonna do it
for this review guys let us know your
thoughts down in the comment section
below and as always if you enjoyed this
video give it a thumbs up we definitely
appreciate it and I will talk to you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
