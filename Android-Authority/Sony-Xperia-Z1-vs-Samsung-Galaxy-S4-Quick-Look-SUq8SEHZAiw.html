Sony is going right up against the best
in the biz this is Josh of Agartha
mandroid Authority what's going on
everybody and this is the Sony Xperia z1
versus the Samsung Galaxy s4 in this
quick look we have two different
philosophies in design here as sony has
been taking its omni balance to its best
with the Xperia z1 the general look and
feel of the original Xperia Z is in full
force here and involves an aluminum
unibody frame that is filled in with
tempered glass the flat sides and rigid
corners make for a unique smartphone
design that we pretty much only see from
Sony the side holds the silver power
button the signature one that also
includes a dedicated camera button too
while the entire phone is very
fingerprint prone this five inch form
factor is still pretty accessible and
isn't too uncomfortable for one hand and
of course there is the water and dust
resistance which typically means the
ports are all covered enter the samsung
galaxy s4 the plastic up against
Xperia's glass this is the
tried-and-true design that Samsung is
very well known for by now with its
pebble-like and rounded look and the
glossy plastic field that can be pretty
slippery to the touch all of this
includes the usual button layout and
removable back that allows for removable
battery and expandable memory its 5-inch
screen is one of the best out there as
its footprint is actually quite
accessible and similar to the original
s3 though the Xperia z1 has definitely
improved on its general handling it has
to contend with the accessibility of the
galaxy s4 there's nothing quite like a
display comparison to remind you how
subjective these things can get the
1080p triluminos display of the Xperia
z1 ticks on the 1080p Super AMOLED of
the Samsung Galaxy s4 while we all know
that the Super AMOLED lends itself
typically to very high saturation the
Xperia z1 has been able to get closer to
that mark through enhancements like the
ex reality engine
it isn't as vibrant as galaxy s4 screen
by far but the more toned down look of
the triluminos is still easy on the eyes
and attractive media viewing has always
been good on Xperia smartphones and in
the z1 it should prove just as enjoyable
as the s4 under the hood we see the z1
taking advantage of a later release
schedule instead of the 1.9 gigahertz
Snapdragon 600 and Adreno 320 that the
galaxy s4 sports the z1 gets the updated
dragging 800 clocked in at 2.2 gigahertz
and has the Adreno 330 performance is
often a spec race and while we had no
problems getting around the Xperia
elements we're sure the experience is
pretty evenly matched here even if the
Xperia z1 does get a little bit of an
edge and it's in the optics that the
Xperia z1 really didn't want to
compromise while the 13 megapixel
shooter in the galaxy s4 has been very
well received for its vibrant and
detailed photos the Xperia z1 is trying
to get as close to a real compact camera
experience as it can with a twenty point
seven exmor r CMOS sensor that echos the
RX line of sony digital cameras this is
indeed going to be a monster of a camera
that should reach a comparable number of
enhancements as the s4 s camera due to
downloadable app enhancements we're
excited to see the comparisons and
picture quality and we will see them
when the time comes and in software its
expiry of vs. TouchWiz in the case of
TouchWiz it's a whole lot of what we've
come to expect with the added navigation
enhancements Samsung put in its
full-featured and for some might be a
little overwhelming on the other hand to
the Xperia UI keeps it pretty simple and
somewhat stock like with a darker tone
interface and mainly additions like
small apps and Sony specific
applications a few new social media
applications have been added in that
help bolster the Xperia U eyes position
but otherwise it's just about what you
remember it being and so there you have
it
sony has gotten closer and closer to
perfecting its smartphone game and the
Xperia z1 is a big step towards that
goal the design of expiry of phones is
always well received by us but the tried
and true galaxy s4 aesthetic is also
very sought after sony has truly
thrusted itself into the thick of it
with the Xperia z1 and we'll have full
in-depth comparisons when we get our
hands on one for now stay tuned for more
