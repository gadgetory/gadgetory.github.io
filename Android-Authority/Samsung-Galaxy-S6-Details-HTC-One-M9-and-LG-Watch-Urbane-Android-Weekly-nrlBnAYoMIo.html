brought to you by domain.com Oh things
are heating up as the Mobile World
Congress approaches because we not only
have credible pics of the new HTC One
but we have a teaser video directly from
Samsung don't mind the I sheep gentleman
behind me I bet he is not back I she is
awesome don't worry I will rehabilitate
him Samsung sure is turning up the hype
machine a few days ago samsung released
its first teaser video of the upcoming
Galaxy s6 which was all about the
handsets camera and now more recently
the company just tweeted a second video
this time it's all about speed now again
we aren't treated to any sneak peeks and
there aren't any features mentioned by
name however it's almost inevitable that
the samsung galaxy s6 will boast
cutting-edge processor technology come
its release samsung recently announced
its revised more energy-efficient 14
nanometer x 107 octa which will be right
on with the speed message in this video
similarly if the reduced bloatware
rumors turn out to be true the galaxy s6
software may be leaner and nippy err
this time around later last week samsung
also talked about the future support for
multiple wireless charging standards
although the galaxy s6 wasn't mentioned
by name the post heavily suggested that
the s6 would be one of the company's
first handsets to feature support for
multiple wireless charging technologies
after the first video we are also pretty
sure that the cameras technology will
again be an important feature for the
galaxy s6 Samsung's executives have
promised intelligent camera technology
and the company recently published an
infographic seen right here about the
evolution of its camera technology also
with regards to the camera Samsung will
reportedly use sony's IM x 240 camera
sensor in the upcoming Galaxy s6 as
reported by Sam mobile the galaxy s6
will also tote a 16 megapixel rear
facing camera and not the 20 megapixel
camera that was previously rumored now
we also have some credible
news regarding the s6 is battery and it
turns out it might only be a 2600
milliamp hour battery a little lower
than we might have expected but now we
have another clue that the galaxy s6
will indeed pack a 2600 milliamp hour
battery in the form of shots uploaded by
a user of China's Weibo social network
one of the albums uploaded by a set user
shows photos that appear to be taken
inside a battery manufacturing facility
and one of the images is tagged samsung
galaxy s6 battery why would Samsung
reduce the battery size of the s6 the
answer may lie on the phone sealed
construction of the six point nine
millimeter profile the design
constraints probably for samsung to
shave off size of the battery inside the
s6 but that doesn't necessarily mean a
smaller battery means reduced battery
life there have been other innovations
in Samsung's recent system-on-a-chip
that reduce battery consumption so we'll
have to wait and see for the review now
for those of you who love the design of
the HTC One m8 you're going to like
these German retailer cyberport put up
product pages showing what appear to be
press shots and complete specifications
of the HTC One m9 the pages have been
since removed but mobile gates preserve
the good stuff for posterity first up
the specs shared by cyberport match
everything we've been hearing through
the grapevine about the HTC One m9 the
device will feature a five inch full HD
screen a Snapdragon 810 processor
clocked at two gigahertz three gigabytes
of ram 32 gigabytes for internal storage
which are expandable and a 2900 male amp
hour battery a 20 megapixel rear facing
camera and a 4 megapixel ultrapixel
front shooter the device will be
slightly thicker and larger than the one
and eight but HTC managed to reduce the
m9 weight so last week I dedicated a
whole show to smartwatches and one of
the stumbling blocks that we felt was
holding smartwatches back was the geeky
design or lack of fashionable design
well LG is trying to change that with
the LG urbane at first glance the LG
watch urbane appears to take the basic
rounded design of the LG G watch our and
simply glam it up a bit we're told it's
a full metal design save the watch
itself and can accept any 22 millimeter
band of your choosing rounding out the
spec list expect the same internals of
the G watch are a 1.2 gigahertz
Snapdragon 400 system-on-a-chip 512
megabytes of RAM 4 gigabytes of internal
storage and a 1.3 inch rounded display
sensors including at the accelerometer
barometer compass and heart rate sensor
a 410 million power battery should keep
the lights on for a day hopefully and
the LG G watch urbane will also be dust
and water-resistant now watch is looking
pretty sweet ladies is that something
you would wear or gentlemen of a more
fashionable persuasion is this something
that you would buy and wear please let
me know in the comments below and last
week's show where I covered smartwatches
there was lots of ladies commenting on
that very topic I'd love to hear it a
couple weeks ago I was able to listen to
a podcast that covered the business
world surrounding domain names and it
was amazing because they were
interviewing people who had very
cleverly bought domain names from 10-15
years ago that weren't popular and
weren't known and people didn't
understand why they would be valuable
and of course a few years later they
were extremely valuable and this just
changed their lives well we're sort of
in a second gold rush when it comes to
domain names because relatively recently
domain name extensions have opened up
it's not just calm net and org anymore I
mean you need to check out the options
and get educated about the possible
opportunities for you you now have the
opportunity to name your site and build
your brand in ways never before possible

than 200 domain name extensions like

taylor just came out with review that
thing looks awesome but it's a little
small for me i'm looking for something
big I use my iPad Mini all the time
right like all day and I need something
more powerful and there are so many more
ipad apps in the iOS ecosystem really
premium gorgeous apps for the tablet a
lot less so in the Google Play Store and
