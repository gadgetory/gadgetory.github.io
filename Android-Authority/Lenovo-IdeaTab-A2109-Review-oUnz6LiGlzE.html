Authority and we're here with a review
of the Lenovo idea tab a 21:09 a little
while back we reviewed the idea table
s21 10 which is lenovo's answer to the
Asus Transformer series this little guy
is kind of their answer to the Nexus 7
but with a larger 9 inch screen we'll
talk about whether or not that's a good
thing later on the idea tab a 21:09
retails for around two hundred and fifty
nine dollars with the sixteen gigabyte
version of the Nexus 7 now selling for
just $1.99 the 16 gig version of this
doesn't look as good as it would have a
month or two ago but before we get into
that let's take a look at the device
itself as you can see the a 21:09 isn't
really as sleek as some of the other
tablets we've seen recently but it's far
from ugly on the front of the device we
find the screen and the 1.3 megapixel
front camera on the Left we see the
volume rocker headphone jack and a
switch that will lock the screen to
either portrait or landscape mode this
makes it easier to use the tablet at
various angles without inadvertently
changing the screens orientation on the
right side we find two ports one micro
USB and one mini HDMI port on the top of
the tablet we find the power switch
while nothing is located on the bottom
of the device finally on the back of the
device we find the three megapixel rear
camera and the speakers along with their
SRS Wow branding the speaker location
makes them hard to accidentally cover
with your hands no matter how you're
holding the tablet the idea tab a 21:09
runs a skinned version of Android 4.0.4
Ice Cream Sandwich there is no word on
whether or not jellybean will be coming
to the tablet but with Lenovo remaining
quiet so far it doesn't seem too likely
while a lot of users prefer stock
Android especially on tablets lenovo
skin doesn't seem to negatively impact
performance too much unlike the s21 10
we reviewed there is no lag when
scrolling through the home screens or
the app drawer
in general the tablets performance is
good the quad-core Tegra 3 processor
makes 3d gaming very smooth and in our
testing we never noticed any significant
slowdowns even with resource intensive
apps and games as with most tablets
there is nothing especially wonderful
about the 3 megapixel camera on the back
of the a 21:09 sure enough it does take
photos but it doesn't do anything
especially impressive with them while
the camera is capable of capturing 1080p
video the low framerate makes it nearly
unusable like the other Lenovo tablet we
looked at recently the build quality of
the idea tab a 21:09 is very solid the
tablet doesn't bend or flex even when
you apply more pressure than you would
in normal use there is a downside here
however that solid build makes the
tablet heavier than a lot of its peers
and this weight combined with the
slightly bulky build makes holding the
tablet for extended periods of time
uncomfortable there is one other problem
related to build quality and it lies in
the motor that provides the tablets
haptic feedback a loud buzzing is
apparent whenever haptic feedback occurs
and it seems to get louder depending on
where on the screen you tap instead of
feeling like the tablet is vibrating
it's very clear that it's just a tiny
motor in the lower left side of the
tablet this could just be a problem with
the review unit we received as the S 21
10 we reviewed didn't have this issue
but it makes it feel very cheap the a20
109 shares its screen resolution with
the Nexus 7 but because it uses a 9 inch
screen instead of a 7 inch screen there
is a loss in pixel density and text in
images don't look as clear as a result
while some users may still prefer the
larger screen the loss of sharpness is a
major downside to wrap up the review
while the lenovo idea tab a 21:09 is a
decent tablet that does perform well
there are plenty of better options at
its price point of 259 dollars if they
did drop the price as Google recently
did with the Nexus 7 it might be worth
picking up especially if you like the 9
inch form factor but right now it just
doesn't stack
now we'd like to know what you think are
we wrong about the idea tab have you got
any suggestions for better tablets in
this price range let us know this has
been Christopher Walken for Android
Authority and as always we'd love to
hear what you think of this video and
other videos on our channel thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
