authority what's going on everybody and
it's the oft rumored SmartWatch coming
out of samsung this is the Samsung
Galaxy gear so this is the SmartWatch
that isn't really being marketed as a
SmartWatch and the samsung's way of
further extending the galaxy experience
it isn't even really consistently called
a watch and is instead just called the
gear a device in a watch form factor
design wise it is definitely a watch
form with an adjustable metal clasp it
isn't too big as the 1.6 3 inch 320 x
320 resolution watch face manages to be
decently sized and comes in at only 74
grams but the jarring section of this
watch is on the outer band guess that is
a camera a 1.9 megapixel camera capable
of photo and video while we were told
that battery testing is still ongoing
with the Galaxy gear we were told that
at least a day's worth of power will be
possible when you look around the device
to microphone holes can be found in yes
the Galaxy gear can receive and take
calls a speaker is built into that metal
clasp and in our initial testing it was
actually pretty loud it's pretty much as
close to Knight Rider status that we
have right now the OS is powered by a
very simplified version of Android with
swipes pretty much encompasses all
navigation swiping down is the back
function unless you are on the home
screen at which time it activates the
camera one button on the side brings you
to home from wherever you are swiping up
brings a dialer for making those calls
and going left and right will bring you
to other apps and functions going left
get you contacts and call logs while
going right brings you various built-in
apps and any other ones later installed
apps by the way will be installed via
Samsung Apps and play more are under
development in what we were told would
be a pretty closed ecosystem when paired
to your Galaxy Note 3 and later other
Samsung devices wonder given
functionality one selection allows you
to see all of your notifications and
when you're looking at certain items
they will automatically come up on the
phone like SMS messages the Bluetooth
functionality can also help you find
your phone if you misplace it and
actually the other way around our
initial impressions of the galaxy gear
focus on potential but currently we're
not completely convinced the camera unit
on the strap is definitely interesting
and obviously lens too pretty stealth
instagramming
taking calls on your SmartWatch might be
interesting in as far as the interface
goes it is obviously in its early stages
as it wasn't as responsive or as snappy
as we might have expected nonetheless
the Galaxy gear comes in six colors that
include lime green and even orange
currently it's looking at a release
nearing the end of September and could
be your next piece of wrist candy will
have a full review when we get our own
so stay tuned to android authority</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
