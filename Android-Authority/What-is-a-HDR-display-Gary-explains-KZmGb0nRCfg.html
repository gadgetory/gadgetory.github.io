authority now if you like me when you
hear the word HDR you think about that
special mode in your camera that allows
you to take better photos brings out the
colors more vividly finds the details in
the shadows
well actually HDR is not only for
capturing images also for displaying
images so the question before today is
what is a HDR display and how does it
work well let me explain
so HDR stands for high dynamic range and
the idea is that it gives you a display
that gives you more vibrant colors
greater brightness greater contrast and
therefore just a better picture on your
smartphone now there are different
competing expanders different competing
ideas about exactly what HDR means and
whether a display qualifies to be called
a HDR display but really there are three
important ingredients the first is the
brightness the display has to be able to
offer a high level of brightness and the
reason for that is because actually it
wants to have a good level of contrast
now contrast is a difference between the
brightest pixel on the screen and the
darkest pixels on the screen
those things are brighter you can get
the screen and the black you can get the
black and the greater the contrast now
brightness and contrast together give
that kind of sharpness that you want to
a display now once you have a bright
display we could contrast the next thing
you need is some vivid colors now colors
are just made on our smartphone
displayed using a combination red green
and blue RGB and each of those colors
has aged between the Blues are given
eight fifths of information but 256
types of red 256 types of green and 256
types of glue and then when you combine
them together you get an overall of just
over 16 million colors now the human eye
can see more than 16 million colors so
the HDR is recommending the use of a new
color space called REC 2020 now in rec
2020 defines an area but taking about
76% of the visible spectrum now to get
that level of color we need to move
beyond 8-bit encoding of the colors into
10 bit or into 12 bits now when you
intend bit encoding of color there are
now a thousand types of red a thousand
types of green and a thousand type or
blue and combined together you get over
a billion different types of color now
to get the most from a HDR display you
need to watch HDR content now if a movie
or a TV series you're watching is
actually encoded using 8-bit color
channels then you can't invent those
extra two bits to give you that extra
color you can't create something from
nothing so to actually have full HD are
you need to watch a media that actually
been recording and encoded in 10-bit
color or even in twelve bit color now
some video formats don't support 10-bit
color channel so mpeg-2 and the format
that's used on blu-ray don't support
10-bit color but some of the newer
codecs like h.265 and there are some
profiles for h.264 which means you can
have 10 bit color as media and so if
you've got 10-bit color media you've got
the brightness and you've got the
contrast then you can truly say you are
watching HDR content on your HDR display
let's go in from android 40 I hope you
enjoyed this video if you did please do
give it a thumbs up a quick shout out to
my colleague Robert Riggs who wrote the
HDR article that you'll find along with
this video over at the anvil authority
comm website please don't forget to
subscribe to and royal authority YouTube
channel hit that Bell icon turn you get
a notification every time we publish a
new video and last but not least do go
over to Andrew authority calm because we
are your source for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
