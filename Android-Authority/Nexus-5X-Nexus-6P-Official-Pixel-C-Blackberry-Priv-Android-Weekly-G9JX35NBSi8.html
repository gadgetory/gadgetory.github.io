like but that didn't stop the world of
Android news from just trucking along
and this past week has been a Google
delicious week no more rumors no more
leaks let's start with the Nexus 5x the
Nexus 5 features a 5.2 inch full HD LCD
display with Gorilla Glass 3 Google's
decision to forego a quad HD panel
shouldn't come as a surprise as this
move was likely made to keep the cost
down the attending to be panel will also
be much less power-hungry than the
higher resolution displays helping the
2700 milliamp hour battery last a bit
longer in hopes that all of the new
battery saving features in the Android
6.0 will make up for it under the hood
the 5x totes a 2 gigahertz wall com
snapdragon 808 processor backed by 2
gigabytes of ram this device comes with
either 16 or 32 gigabytes of on-board
storage now if you need more than that
you'll have to rely on the cloud as the
5x does not come with a micro SD card
slot for expandable storage if you're
willing to skip the 5x and would like a
nexus with a bit more onboard storage
the newly announced Nexus 6p comes with
32 64 or 128 gigabyte flavors there's
also a 12 point three megapixel rear
facing camera with an f-stop of two
point O aperture on board as well as a
5-megapixel front-facing camera both the
Nexus 5 the nexus 6 feature optical
image stabilization but unfortunately
the Nexus 5x does not we're not entirely
sure why Google chose to leave this
helpful feature out of the camera Nexus
phones have always struggled in the
camera Department and we're really
hoping that the Nexus 5x won't suffer
from the same fate and in true Nexus
tradition the 5x will be relatively
affordable starting at three hundred and
seventy nine dollars and will ship out
in October now let's talk as bigger
brother the Nexus 6p briefly the specs
include a 5.7 inch AMOLED qhd display
with 518 pixels per inch it sports a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor but it
is
the second version so that should not
overheat it has an Adreno 430 GPU three
gigabytes of RAM and the storage options
come in at 32 64 128 gigabytes it does
not have a microSD card slot it runs
Android marshmallow has a rear-mounted
fingerprint scanner and as a 12 point
three megapixel rear cam and an eight
megapixel front facing camera it has a
3450 milliamp hour non removable battery
unlike in past years Google doesn't plan
to offer its phones directly via
carriers in the US in a model similar to
what we are seeing from Motorola with
the Moto X pure edition in fact while
select international retailers will
still offer the nexus family in the u.s.
the Nexus phones will be available only
through the google play store the nexus
p is obviously a bit more expensive than
the 5x thanks to its be for your specs
and the more premium design with a
starting price of five hundred dollars
for the 32 gigabyte variant the 64
gigabyte model is five hundred forty
nine dollars and 128 gigabyte model is
just six hundred and forty nine dollars
those who buy either model will also get
90 days of free google play music and
those who pre-order will get a
fifty-dollar google play gift card as an
added perk now let's talk the pixel see
the pixel series for those who follow
Chromebooks has been previously used
only for the most premium offerings and
manufactured and sold directly through
google itself the pixel see follows in
the tradition of being a high spec high
performance high priced device though in
this case it's running Android 6.0
marshmallow as opposed to Chrome OS the
pixel see features a 2560 x 1800 10.2
inch screen with 308 pixels per inch it
has an nvidia x1 system-on-a-chip with
maximal GPU 3 gigabytes of ram and
either 32 or 64 gigabytes of on-board
storage it will make use of USB type-c
is made of aluminium and as mentioned
earlier will ship with Android 6.0
marshmallow as per the pixel laptop
series the device also includes an LED
strip that can be double tapped to
indicate battery life one accessory has
been announced thus far an aluminium
keyboard which can attach the tablet and
a mic
soft surface apple ipad pro type fashion
via magnets and connects to the system
via bluetooth google has indicated the
accessory is the same size as a standard
keyboard due to some strategic
rearrangement of keys and a use of the
tablets touchscreen it should make for a
very comfortable user experience the
device will retail for 499 at 32
gigabytes or 599 for 64 gigabytes and
will be available for purchase by the
end of the year the keyboard will retail
separately for a hundred and forty nine
dollars and finally let's talk about the
blackberry prive blackberry prive
formerly known by its internal code name
Venice is BlackBerry's first foray into
Android which the Canadian company has
tried and ultimately failed to fight off
with its own operating system blackberry
10 prive combines the best of blackberry
security and productivity with the
expansive mobile application ecosystem
available on the android platform said
blackberry CEO john chen the device
promises quote best-in-class security
for enterprise customers as part of the
company's heritage and core mission of
protecting customers privacy the
privileged major markets in store and
online the slide-out keyboard and the
focus on privacy and security aren't
just new features their major
differentiators from BlackBerry's
competition so if you have that you'd
think you would want a really awesome
demo not this it runs google right and
then yeah so well that i have to set it
up and this is it is a demo unit so so
it runs google and i'll go back to my
main screen and see what i could get
anything wow i was exploded have you
seen Apple and Google do product
launches it is a performance every
segment is properly planned and
rehearsed to clearly communicate the
benefits of those new features they make
a major media splash doing so and what
did you do you didn't even prep your
device you have the opportunity to make
a huge industry media splash
instead you made a burp you think I'm
being harsh I'm not being harsh
blackberry needs a new CEO that was an
unforgivable lapse of judgment a missed
opportunity for a company in its last
dying breath let me know what you think
in the comments below I'll be reading
them you'd also don't want to forget
about my brothers and sister and Android
we're working super hard to be your
source for all things Android
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
