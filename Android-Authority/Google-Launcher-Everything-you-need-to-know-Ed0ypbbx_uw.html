handy the Android authority app guy when
the Nexus 5 and Android KitKat were
first announced a bunch of apks were
pulled so people could get early access
to a bunch of KitKat and Nexus 5 goodies
so in this video we're gonna take a look
at the Google launcher first let's talk
about the UI the first two things most
people will notice are the sudden
disappearance of blue whom just about
everywhere and the much larger icons the
blue was replaced by white and this
combined with translucent elements gives
it a color neutral look this means it
goes well with pretty much any wallpaper
and theme which is a solid improvement
over prior offerings upon further
investigation you'll no doubt notice the
completely built-in Google now as it was
before the search bars at the top of
every homescreen and to the left of the
main screen isn't always open Google now
as reports have indicated Google search
is essentially the launcher now you can
also access Google anytime on the home
screens by simply saying OK Google as
you move around the UI you'll notice
other changes the widgets are no longer
in the icon drawer you'll have to long
press the home screen in order to get to
them this is also how you change the
wallpaper the settings deal exclusively
with Google now options like whether or
not to turn it on or off and various
other tweaks so here's what we like the
new aesthetic is color neutral and with
the translucency and larger icons
everything seems to look more colorful
even on phones not optimized to use it
the performance is buttery smooth ok
Google and the Google now pager great
additions it makes the devices feel more
interactive all empty home screens are
automatically deleted you can have as
many as you need but if you clear one
out it's gone this is great because
you're no longer bound by the forced 5
home screens and you can have as few as
one and here's what we didn't like
Google now kind of pulled a blinkfeed
we're in Google now takes up a home
screen and you really can't get it back
even if you disable Google now you still
can't scroll left of the main home
screen
unless Google makes this app in the
Google Play Store issues like broken
Google now and bad scaling on tablets
probably won't be fixed for a while
lastly we wish there were more options
for customization this is a very simple
launcher that you can't really tweak at
all to your tastes insofar as
performance and looks are concerned at
Google launcher is a win it goes with
any theme it looks bright and it runs
buttery smooth the issues with voice
search and landscape mode and tablets is
unfortunate but we have to remember that
this is optimized for Android 4.4 which
means not for
devices so there is a chance that those
issues will never get fixes overall if
you can deal with the problems or if you
have route and can fix them this is a
great and simple launcher to have once
