Android authority and this is LG's
latest flagship the g3 versus the HTC
One m8 it's 2014 and every OEM has
pretty much figured out a design
language that works for them and makes
their products easy to identify starting
with the LG g3 LG basically took the
existing design of the g2 listened to
their consumers and pretty much improved
upon it in every single way it's still
made of polycarbonate but instead of a
glossy back you know having back that's
been treated with a faux brushed metal
look that not only looks really good but
it doesn't attract finger prints and the
curve along the back makes it sit very
nicely in the hand the back is also
removable giving you access to the
microSD and the swappable battery the
buttons are still located on the back
below the camera optics but they've been
drastically improved they're very clicky
and easy to find and they no longer
protrude out of the back so you don't
have to worry about any accidental
presses the learning curve also is not
steep as you might think and it takes
only a matter of minutes to get used to
it now looking at the HTC One m8 HTC has
also taken their existing design from
the m7 last year and made a lot of
improvements it's now made of 90 percent
metal so there's a lot less of that
plastic injection molding except for
where it's needed and the phone looks
and feels more premium than ever
HTC has always been known for their
build quality and they really top
themselves with the m8 just like the g3
the back of the MA is also curved giving
it a very comfortable feel in the hand
and it also does a great job of not
attracting fingerprints it's a unibody
design so the back isn't removable like
the g3 meaning you don't have access to
the battery and that's typically the
trade off with a metal phone but HTC did
include microSD card expansion this time
around via a tray on the side of the
phone the buttons are still in their
usual locations for a HTC device with
the volume rockers on the side and the
power button located on the top that's
very hard to reach without shuffling the
phone in your hand while both of these
companies have taken their existing
designs and improved upon them in pretty
much every way possible the size of the
LG g3 is really impressive it's got a
larger display the
the one m8 but thanks to those super
thin vessels it's not that much larger
than the m8 the height difference
between the two is negligible and the g3
is not that much wider in comparison
handling these phones do feel very
similar as they both have curved backs
giving them a great in hand feel all the
HTC One is heavier obviously due to the
metal construction but they both feel
very solid in the hand and are two of
the best-looking phones you can get on
the market right now moving along to the
display the LG g3 is king right now at
least when it comes to the resolution
and pixel density
it's a 5.5 inch display with the
resolution of 2560 by 1440 and a PPI of
530 for the first of its kind at least
in the United States and for the most
part it's every bit as good as you would
hope it to be the colors aren't washed
out but they look a little cold to my
eyes at least in comparison to the m8
but otherwise that looks great it's very
bright with great viewing angles and
it's super sharp just as you would
expect even though there isn't a lot of
content taking advantage of the
resolution right now it still looks
fantastic and when the content finally
catches up to it it's only going to get
better the HTC One m8 on the other hand
is a 5-inch display with a lower
resolution of 1920 by 1080 and a PPI of
441 but the screen on the ma is still
nothing to scoff at it's still a very
sharp looking display with fantastic
colors viewing angles and brightness
when you put these phones side-by-side
are you going to notice the difference
if you look hard enough yeah you will
notice the difference but like I
mentioned earlier until the content from
developers videos and games catches up
to the resolution you're not going to be
missing out on much and at the end of
the day both of these displays are
beautiful to look at on the inside both
of these phones are very similarly specs
so you can expect very fast performance
on both they're both packin a Snapdragon
801 chip the audrina 330 GPU and 2 gigs
of ram with 32 gigs of internal storage
on the One m8 while the LG g3 will come
with two gigs of ram on the 16 gigabyte
model and three gigs of ram on the 32
gigabyte model both these phones just
absolutely fly
I even with the respective skins on top
of Android you're not going to
experience any sort of slowdown that
would be detrimental to your overall
experience I do find the experience with
HTC Sense to be just a tad snappier in
comparison to LG's GUI and while the g3
might outperform the one mA in benchmark
scores the real-world performance is
what matters most and at the end of the
day both of these phones are blazing
fast and you can't go wrong with either
one when it comes to the rest of the
hardware they share some things in
common but there's probably a lot more
differences than similarities and
depending on who you are some might
outweigh the others both include microSD
card slots if you absolutely have to
have expandable storage with the g3 is
placed underneath the battery cover
while the One m8 so like I mentioned
earlier sits in a tray on the right side
there is also an IR blaster on both if
you like using your phone as a TV remote
the larger 3000 milliamp hour battery on
the g3 is removable whereas the smaller
2600 milliamp hour battery on the m8 is
completely sealed in one of the biggest
differences that you're going to notice
on these two phones is in the sound
quality of the speakers obviously HTC is
still the one to beat when it comes to
their front-facing Boone sound speakers
and while the back facing single speaker
on the LG g3 sounds pretty good for what
it is it certainly isn't going to give
the front firing speakers on the MAA run
for its money
yeah
as far as battery life is concerned
we've already established that the LG g3
has a larger battery than the One m8 and
it also holds a slight edge for being
user replaceable but when purely talking
about battery life performance I've
actually found the battery life between
the g3 and One m8 to be very comparable
to one another and that's kind of
impressive on the g3 s part especially
considering it has to power a larger
more higher resolution display but I've
managed to make it through a full day
just fine on both and as long as I'm
able to make it through a full day and
do whatever it is that I need to get
done I am perfectly fine with that now
if you need to stretch the battery life
of your phone even further
both the g3 and the One m8 feature power
saving modes but one thing to know is
the power saving mode on the m8 will
vary from carrier to carrier as the
Verizon version that I'm using currently
does not have this feature taking a look
at the camera on both we're looking at
two very different approaches the LG g3
has a more typical camera with the 13
megapixel sensor a new laser auto
focusing system and LG's os+ technology
built in what the laser focusing system
you're able to get a really fast
autofocus allowing you to snap shots
more quickly and it works extremely well
os plus is also great combining both
software and hardware stabilization to
help you take great-looking shots
whether you have steady hands or not
taking pictures with the g3 also
couldn't be more simplistic because the
camera pretty much does all of the work
there's a few shooting modes built in
but other than that you're not going to
find any manual controls like ISO or
exposure value allowing you to focus
more on taking photos versus fumbling
around with camera settings now with the
HTC One m8 HTC is choosing to stay out
of the megapixel race once again and
sticking with therefore ultra pixel
camera this time around there's a
secondary camera built-in for capturing
depth information but OAS has
unfortunately been omitted because of
this with the secondary camera sensor
you're able to do some very cool
focusing effects after the shot has
already been taken with the U focus
feature and if you take the picture just
right you can get some very convincing
depth of field the camera UI on the One
m8 is also pretty simple and straight
bored as well but you do get a lot more
granular controls that you don't get on
the g3 if you're looking purely at
resolution the g3 wins hands down with
its 13 megapixel sensor you're going to
get much sharper and more detailed
looking photos and you'll also be able
to zoom and crop which can't be said
about the four ultra pixel lens on the
m8 now megapixels or ultra pixels in the
em eights case aren't everything when it
comes to picture quality but when
comparing photos of the g3 to the m8
side-by-side the photos on the g3 just
look better in pretty much every way
besides being sharper and more detailed
colors look a lot more vibrant dynamic
range is also better and I prefer the
HDR mode on the g3 as I find the HDR
mode on the HTC One m8 to be slightly
over aggressive with the processing
low-light photography seems about the
same on both I didn't think either
camera outshine the other if anything
the MA is slightly more noisy but other
than that they don't seem to perform too
differently from each other in low-light
if all you ever do is upload photos to
social media both of these phones are
more than capable of that but if you're
looking to do some more serious
smartphone photography the LG g3 is the
better camera overall if you don't have
as much control over the camera settings
the fully automatic mode does a great
job on the software level both the g3
and One m8 are running on the Android
4.4.2 kitkat with the respective skins
on top of Android the LG g3 is running
LG's GUI and they have made a lot of
improvements to it over the course of
the last couple years it's a lot flatter
and cleaner looking now with a more
toned down color scheme but there still
seems to be just as many features as
ever
you still get LG's quick slide apps but
now that they can easily be hidden
I basically forgot that that feature is
even there and LG's dual window feature
is also here as well if you want to do
some true multitasking some of the more
useful features include the resizable
keyboard the customizable navigation bar
and LG's now pretty popular knock on and
knock code what the One m8 we're looking
at HTC Sense 6 software and this is
probably their best version of sense yet
they've really listened to feedback and
not only does it look good but it's not
cluttered with a bunch of gimmicky
features
all the staple features that you come to
expect from sensor all still here like
Zoey's video highlights and blinkfeed
that sits one swipe away from your main
home screen my favorite part about since
6 is the new motion gestures not only
because they help with the handling of
the One m8 allowing you to avoid the
power button altogether but you can
quickly access features like blinkfeed
voice dialing and the camera all without
having to wake up your phone first while
LG has made some really great strides
with the GUI the sense 6 software is
just a lot cleaner and simple in
comparison if you don't mind a very
heavy feature set you'll like the GUI
but if you want something that adds to
the Android experience and isn't quite
as in-your-face since 6 is the way to go
and for me personally since 6 has always
been one of the better Android skins out
there the HTC One m8 is already
available on every carrier for $200 on a
two-year contract with the exception of
t-mobile obviously because they don't do
contracts anymore but you do have the
option to finance the cost of the phone
and the LG g3 is slowly making its way
to carriers as we speak and you can
expect it to cost about the same as any
other high-end flagship whether it's on
a contract or unlocked and it's probably
going to be about $700 if you decide to
go the unlocked route but there you have
it for the LG g3 versus the HTC One m8
at the end of the day these are both
fantastic phones and you can't really go
wrong with either one as both companies
basically took their existing flagships
from last year and improved upon them
what it's really going to come down to
is what's more important to you do you
want one of the first phones with a 2k
display a laser auto focusing system and
a swappable battery or would you rather
have the beautiful metal design of the
HTC One the duo camera and the best
speakers you can find on a smart phone
right now with HTC's boomsound speakers
the choice is ultimately yours but that
