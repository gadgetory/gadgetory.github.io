handy the Android authority app guy and
welcome back to Google Play weekly in
this week's episode we have a lot to
talk about including the latest
tinkering that Google has been doing
with Google Chrome an app that wants to
deliver motox features to every Android
phone and finally the release of plants
vs. zombies 2 so let's get started
the first thing we'll talk about this
week is Google Chrome because Google
Chrome got a couple of updates the first
update brought gesture controls which
allows you to change tabs easier and
access the menu faster it also allows
you to reverse image search the second
update is only available in the latest
beta for now there is now an option to
add home screen shortcuts for web apps
this has been a feature for a long time
in the actual Chrome browser and in
Chrome OS some believe that this is the
next logical step in the unification of
PC and mobile chrome experience while
others maintain that chrome and Android
should remain separate so there is a
little bit of controversy with this one
if you want a chromecast in you're a fan
of Hulu then this next story is gonna be
good news for you Hulu recently updated
its Android application to include
chromecast support Hulu fans could use
the Chrome browser
earlier but let's face it Android
support is preferable as one might
expect you'll need a Hulu Plus
subscription in order to use this
feature so if you're not a Hulu
subscriber you're kind of out of luck if
you do pay the $7.99 a month to get Hulu
Plus you can take advantage of the new
features as soon as the update rolls out
to you arguably one of the best features
of the Moto X is always on always on
lets you talk to the phone even when the
screen is off and as Motorola has shown
us there are plenty of situations where
this can be a good thing agent is a
recently released application that wants
to bring this functionality to all
Android devices the app is pretty useful
even if it can't hold a candle to Google
now that said it's still one of the best
fire-and-forget apps out there and it
includes a number of useful features as
development continues and more features
get added we can see this becoming a
must have app for non Moto X users very
soon I know a lot of you have been
asking me about plants vs. zombies too
and guess what I finally have some good
news for you
plants vs. zombies 2 has finally been
released in the Google Play Store in
select countries so far only residents
of Australia and New Zealand can
download the game and play it right now
but that just means that a world red
release is imminent
there has been no official release date
so the official word remains that it'll
be out for everyone soon enough some
features of the sequel include better
plans to defend your lawn new zombies
zombie chickens and it's compatible with
Android 2.3 and up on devices with a one
gigahertz processor or better a recently
published report essentially proves that
you don't need antivirus or anti-malware
applications between verify apps
permissions installing from trusted
sources and all the other security
features you find in stock Android the
risk is literally in Vanessa Mille so if
you want to know how powerful the stock
Android security is there are simply too
many safety settings a user has to
ignore in order for malware to actually
make it onto an Android device the odds
of malware actually making it through
all those steps are so small that it
can't even be calculated so in other
words if you use the safety features
built right into Android you're 99.9
percent secure and that's pretty good so
who wants to see some trending
applications as usual if you want to
check these out the links are in the
video description first up this week is
TeamViewer the app was recently updated
to include a few new features including
clipboard synchronization Morlock
computer options and of course the
boilerplate bug fixes and performance
improvements if you've been holding off
on remote communication between your PC
and Android devices now's a good time to
check that out the popular audio app has
been getting only better lately and with
its latest update it's probably better
than it's ever been the latest updates
give users new stations to listen to
lets people share stations and now
stations are free on mobile who doesn't
like free our next stop is a nifty
little launcher that is designed for
simplicity and ease of use for senior
citizens if you know someone who could
benefit from a simple launcher with
large icons then this is the app we'd
recommend for them it's free it can turn
Android into something everyone can use
and it really is helpful and awesome
TripAdvisor made our best travel apps
list from a few months ago and it's back
in our trending apps this week in recent
updates Trip Advisor has overhauled
their UI their new UI is a lot cleaner
and more user friendly and everything
seems to be loading faster if you dumped
a TripAdvisor before we recommend giving
it another shot it's free so what can it
hurt the hockey season has started and
yahoo has finally updated their fantasy
app for the 2013-2014
season and hasn't gotten the UI updates
that Yahoo's weather app has gotten but
it's still a functional and powerful app
if you played Yahoo fantasy hockey it's
a nice app and it's ready for the season
