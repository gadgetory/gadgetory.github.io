authority now you've probably heard
about these sort of CPU problems that
we've got moment will melt down and
spectra and so the question is what is
the fundamental problem with today's
CPUs that it's causing all of these
problems well let me explain now of
course you can read some really
fantastic details on the neck about the
real nitty-gritty of what the problems
are but really what I want to do is
explain it to you in the simplest
possible terms and try not to kind of
get too deep into the technically but to
understand what this fundamental problem
is and why really CPU design going
forward and that's probably CPUs we're
gonna see launched in 2019 onwards are
really gonna have to have change the way
they work at a very fundamental level so
we're gonna do this in four stages and
let's try to get through this simply
number one and normal computer has a set
of instructions that it follows load up
this number from memory add one to it
put that result back into memory and
it's just basically a sequence of
instructions and that's how computers
work now I've got a whole video on
instructions per cycle which would go
much deeper into the things I'm going to
talk about pipelines and decoding and
all that so if you want to watch that
and I recommend you do of course I would
say that I'd recommend you watch all my
videos okay but here's the link to that
you really should go and watch that now
what happens is is that when computers
do these instructions we it's actually
pretty obvious that it doesn't do them
just one at a time it doesn't just load
that thing and then wait around while
the others are doing nothing because
today's computers are so fast that
actually the CPU can run faster than it
can take to get memory information so in
that time it's waiting something come
back for a memory it's actually just
sitting there saying well nothing to do
now so what they decide to do is split
up the execution of instructions into a
thing called a pipeline and the
instructions come down the pipeline and
each little bit of the pipeline is a
tiny bit step closer to actually
executing the instruction and they kind
of the the easiest way to show that is
that you basically do a fetch sex
next instruction from memory you decode
it to actually work out what it is and
then you execute and that would be a
three-stage pipe but actually the pipes
can get much longer you get 10 11 12
stage pipes in modern CPUs now as it's
going along it's becoming a step closer
to actually executing the the thing and
the the actual instruction when it's
finally executing the registers has
changed and the state changes inside the
CPU that said that the instructions have
been retired that means it's actually
been always through that pipe drops on
the end of the pipe and it's actually
been executed actually been retired now
that's all great
if programs just ran in a straight line
is they just kept running from one
instruction one instruction to talk to
the three hallway raid down and never
ever jumped anywhere never branched off
to another place that pipeline would be
fantastic the problem is computers
branch all over the place all the time
it's one of their main things they do
for example if you say you had a game
and the little character was bouncing
along and it gets to the edge of the
screen at some book you say if he's at
the edge of the screen then do something
different you know bounce him back the
other way or he dies because he dropped
off the edge of the chasm so at some
point there has to be a thing in the
program it says if this thing has
happened they branch off here and do a
different bit of code now if you think
about if the computers been filling up
its pipeline with all the instructions
that are coming ahead of it and then
suddenly the computer branches off now
all those instructions in that pipeline
are no longer needed and that means they
have to be emptied out of the pipeline
completely cleared out and they call
that having a bubble in the pipeline
like an air bubble stuck in your
pipeline because there's now a void
where nothing actually happens and the
computer has to wait around until it
gets in the next set of instructions
that are actually where the the program
jumped to now to try to reduce the
number of bubbles and reducing the
number of bubbles is seen as one of the
most important things you can do to
increase performance they have a thing
called a branch predictor now the branch
predictor says actually which way is the
program going to jump in three
instructions time it's gonna jump is it
going to jump back up on itself to keep
on repeating or is it going to jump off
somewhere completely different than the
branch predicted tries to find out where
the program's going to go and then in
doing that it loads up the instructions
ahead of it where it thinks to
program is going to go and therefore
when it does jump the right instructions
are already in the pipeline and there's
no bubble brilliant but there's a
problem with this approach and that is
is that instructions can be executed or
half executed half-baked half travelling
down the pipeline that I never used and
they get discarded but if that that
process of discarding them was
completely atomic with completely black
a box had no effect on the rest of the
CPU then it would be greatly doesn't
because in the moment that it has to
fetch something from memory even though
these structures never been executed it
preemptively it's kind of ahead of
itself is speculating what it needs it
goes it gets that memory and it brings
it in and in doing so it alters the
cache now I've got a whole video on
cache memory cache memories fast memory
that's at the same space in the same
space as the CPUs you can run very very
fast and there's a link here to go and
find out about cache memory and this is
our fourth point the side channel access
is that the cache can be altered and
then doing some very clever stuff with
timers you can go and get the same piece
of information again and then if it took
a long time you knew what was there if
it didn't take a long time you knew that
it wasn't in the cache and that
basically means you can use this kind of
a secret backdoor to examine the cache
and take out things from there from
instructions that were never executed
and because they were never executed the
checks on whether they're allowed to be
executed whether that memory is actually
accessible or not we're never done that
means you can start trolling through the
computer memory other users parts of the
kernel
whatever you like taking out passwords
taking up cryptic every keys taking out
whatever you like because the check to
whether the program was actually allowed
to do it or not he's never done until
the instruction is actually executed and
because the program the instruction is
never executed because it's all
disregarded then the printer computers
at all I didn't do anything wrong I I've
not broken any access barriers here I
have not given you access to anything
you should have actually I never
actually read that instruction but it
did in its pipeline and then by using
these cache timing tricks you can work
out what was in the cache and hence the
whole memory becomes
that available to any program and that's
the fundamental problem I'm going since
