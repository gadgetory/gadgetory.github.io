brought to you by the LG g3 the biggest
feature of the LG g3 is quite literally
its biggest feature and that's the 5.5
inch screen that comes with a quad HD
resolution at 2560 x 1440 but we wanted
to take a closer look at this screen the
first of its kind available in the
United States and take a look at some of
the benefits not only in regards to the
high resolution but also to the larger
size of the screen itself so it's josh
Vergara from android authority what's
going on everybody and this is a look at
the screen of the LG g3 now one of the
best ways to take a look at the benefits
of a quad HD display is to compare it to
more conventional screams like say a
1080p display and what better one to
show then the original LG g2 the g3's
predecessor that also came with its own
great display if you take a look at this
already you'll see that LG has continued
to really push the envelope in terms of
their bezel sizes around the screen the
g2 kind of started it and the g3
continues that you only get pretty much
the screen up front which is a great
because it also helps with the handling
which we'll get into in a bit but let's
go ahead and take a look at some
comparison i'm going to zoom into a lot
of elements on both of these devices and
you'll see the difference in resolution
and also in the sharpness from one to
the other here's a look at some icons
that i had on the screen you'll see that
both of these displays have the same
wallpaper so that we have a good point
of reference when it comes to the look
on both of these devices and we'll take
a look at a few of the icons here now
you'll notice that there's just a little
bit more clarity on the right side which
is of course the LG g3 and on the left
side the g2 while it does have a
respectable pixel density of its own the
higher resolution of the g3 obviously
allows for even more to be packed in
alright and i will move on to some video
now of course you're going to be
watching a lot of video on devices like
your smartphones but having a 5.5 inch
screen allows you to have a much larger
real estate to be able to enjoy your
videos whether they be from places like
Netflix or YouTube and be able to enjoy
them even more on this larger screen and
finally here's a look at some text
zoomed in on the chrome browser I went
ahead and just zoomed right on into the
text on here and you can see that on one
side you still have a
very good pixel density that allows for
the sharpness of the text but on the
other side it is not only comparable
it's also a little bit more far and
beyond just to be able to really give
you that sharpness and clarity that you
want to see in the text if you're going
to be reading say ebooks or just
browsing the web in general and finally
at the end we're just going to take a
look at Epic Citadel it's a benchmarking
application that i haven't used in a
little bit but i thought it would be a
good way of showing the 3d capability
not only of the processing package found
within but also in terms of looking at
the screen and how well it is able to
produce and to display all of these
great graphical elements alright and
let's take a look at the handling what
we have here in the LG g2 the original
from last year is the small bezel the
thin bezel all around that allowed for
very easy handling despite this screen
being a little bit larger than the other
5 inch screen devices out there also you
still had a pretty thin and very slim
device provided that the back button
layout didn't need to add anything to
the sides of this device so all in all
this was one of the better handling
devices despite having a larger screen
and since our devices are going to be
blown up to larger sizes these days the
g3 is ahead of the curve by having that
5.5 inch screen but it also has those
small vessels that LG is so good at
making and the back button layout of
course that allows this entire device to
be nice and slim but when it comes to
the screen those small bezels really do
help because if you ever use other large
devices out there it might be a little
bit tough to use in one hand but that's
not the case with the g3 especially for
particular tasks that you would need to
do in one hand like say typing you are
able to reach the other side of the
screen without much difficulty at all
and thus that makes this one of the most
accessible large devices out there with
this screen in this bezel this is also
one of the more attractive ones because
you have so much screen real estate to
be able to watch and play anything that
you want with no trouble at all if
you're not a proponent of larger screens
on device as well maybe you just haven't
tried one because there are a lot of
benefits to them I already showed you
the resolution that you find on the LG
g3 because it has that quad HD display
but by having a larger surface area for
you to work with you could do a lot of
different things with the screen like
read even more because it can fit more
you can watch videos even easier but
also there's gaming and I already showed
you Epic Citadel earlier but let me just
show you
now what it looks like when you're
gaming on the screen because there's a
lot of room to be able to maybe use the
touch controls and still not obstruct
any of the action that is happening on
the screen this is an example with combo
crew and it is a breeze on this display
not only is it sharper here because of
the higher resolution but it's easier to
actually play it because I'll be able to
use the thumb controls on the sides
without obstructing anything in the
middle and so there you have it for this
look at the screen of the LG g3 well now
one thing that is great about this
screen is the fact that you get the best
of both worlds if you had a high
resolution but you have a smaller size
display you might not be able to really
enjoy that high resolution quite as much
if you had a larger screen but a lower
resolution well we've all had to deal
with that before it's all it's not
really the best case in this phone you
get not only the larger screen at 5.5
inches but you get the quad HD
resolution and that allows for not only
the great pixel density and clarity for
all of the things that you want to do
but it also allows you the great screen
real estate to be able to do all those
things even easier than before so keep
it tuned to android authority for all
the best coverage we have even more
coming of the LG g3 as the launch is
happening all around the states right
now I'm sure a lot of you out there are
getting your hands on this phone as we
speak and you can sound off in the
