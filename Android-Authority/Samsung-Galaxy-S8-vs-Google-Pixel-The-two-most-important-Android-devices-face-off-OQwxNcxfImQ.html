against the beloved official Google
phone this is Joshua Vergara what's
going on everybody and this is the
Samsung Galaxy s8 and the s8 plus versus
the Google pixel both phones come in a
couple of sizes but it is important to
note that the Galaxy s8 has roughly the
same screen size as the Google pixel XL
I use the pixel XL and putting it up
against the smaller Galaxy s8 really
shows the differences the pixel XL has
so much going on a rounded screen and of
course that's a flat panel so its body
feels much larger than it probably needs
to be especially after getting spoiled
by the ergonomics of the Galaxy s8 it's
5.7 inch display manages to feel smaller
than the 5.5 inch display of the pixel
XL and even then the SI plus packs all
whopping 6.2 inch display on a body that
is actually pretty decent to reach
around the resolution of the galaxy
phones are also bumped up to 29 60 by
1440 for an aspect ratio of 18 point 5
by 9 some changes had to be made to the
galaxy s formula to make this feed a
reality gone are the Samsung logos on
the tactile home buttons with the shift
of the fingerprint reader going to the
back of the device this is similar to
the pixel imprint location but on the
galaxy s 8 phones it's a little bit odd
to have the fingerprint reader right
next to the camera lens the side buttons
are also similar but an extra button for
Samsung's bigsby software now appears
under the volume rocker now Bigsby is
Samsung's answer to Google assistant but
also it's kind of not because Bigsby is
a layer that you can use on top of an
included Google assistant Google
assistant was pixels main feature and
now it's coming on a lot of different
devices Samsung's newest ones being part
of that Bunch Bigsby brings a lot of
features to the table not only a splash
screen for a lot of contextual elements
but also voice input and fix the layers
into the camera so that you can scan
pretty much anything and Bixby will be
able to assist with that so with that
all said much of the battle here will go
to the newer device because the Google
pixel falls behind a 20-17 pack with the
Snapdragon 820 one and a lack of
expandable storage the galaxy s 8 and
the S 8 plus include the updated
versions of these specs and add in
Samsung pay and wireless charging the s8
plus slightly edges out the pixel XL in
its battery offering 3500 milliamp hours
over 30 450 in the Google branded
competitor
the pixel camera has been received well
by users and actually has gotten a few
accolades but they might be edged out a
bit by the Galaxy S 8 cameras the
megapixel counts are all similar 12
megapixel for the rear and 8 for the
front
however the Galaxy S 8 cameras let in a
little bit more light at F 1.7 aperture
on both ends we've applauded Galaxy
cameras in the past especially for their
future sets and manual controls our
future comparison will explore this
further and see which shooter comes out
on top and to end software is a matter
of subjectivity as pure Android nougat
on the pixel is obviously beloved by
Android purists on the other hand
Samsung has tried really hard to dial
back on their UI in recent years and we
see small but welcomed changes in design
elements are pleasing to the eye and
plenty of features are in view but are
not intrusive it's no surprise that
Samsung packs a ton of features
including all of the different gestures
all of the different features in the
edge UX and that might be a little bit
too much for people who want just a
simple form of Android it's no surprise
that Samsung packs a ton of features
into its software and if that's
something that you want then of course
the Samsung device is probably what
you'll pick but Android lovers will look
at the Google pixel and say that it's
version of Android has been plenty
reliable and that is quite true that
said it is hard to deny how Samsung is
continuing to evolve the galaxy line
even if it means slightly shifting that
familiar look we will see how the pixel
on the new Galaxy device is fare in
future in depth comparisons once we have
our hands on the new Samsung phones and
