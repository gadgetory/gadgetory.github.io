handy the Android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly this
is episode number 168 so let's get
started Pech is a new startup that spun
off off of Rovio and yes we're talking
about the developers of Angry Birds
hatchets working on a project that will
allow you to stream android games to
your device and then play them for free
there won't be any in-app purchases or
updates to deal with it'll be just you
and the game there are some ambitious
ideas like pulling the internet for help
inside of the game even in single-player
games and invite betas should be out in
early 2017 Facebook shut down its live
video API access for Prisma this last
week previously Prisma was using the API
to allow people to create filters while
streaming live on Facebook
now that is no longer possible Facebook
sent Prisma an email stating that access
was revoked because Facebook already
supported the feature in reality it
seems like Facebook is just shutting
down some competition before their own
filter option starts rolling out
greatjob Facebook it has been reported
that 1 million Google accounts have been
breached by a brand new kind of malware
called Goolagong it affects people who
download third-party applications not on
the Google Play Store from there it
downloads root kits and tries to get
control of your device you know the
usual malware crap it's unfortunate but
those who keep their downloading
strictly to Google Play don't need to
worry because the exploit is not present
there a study released this week showed
that consumers spent more than 1 billion
dollars during Black Friday 2016 by
using their smartphones and tablets this
is the first time that number has ever
eclipsed 1 billion dollars and shows
that more people than ever are shopping
online and using their smartphones to do
it we've no doubt that apps contributed
to this overall total after all most
brick-and-mortar stores now have their
own apps these days the total online
sales from the weekend topped five
billion dollars overall Google Play is
now actively trying to hunt down fake
reviews in the Google Play Store it's
been an issue for a while now
essentially what happens as shady
developers pay people to download the
application over and over again on
different accounts and leave favorable
reviews the rating goes way up and
people think the application is great
even when it's really not we don't know
how effective this fake review washing
will be but we hope it's pretty damn
effective distraint is a horror
adventure game that runs on the same
game engine as the five nights at
freddy's games
for you PC gamers out there yes this is
the same game that was released on Steam
last year in this title you'll play
through a 2d experience and solve
puzzles the controls are rather simple
and it shouldn't take you long to learn
how to play the developers claim that
the game should take around 2 hours to
complete you can download it for free or
fork out the very reasonable dollar and
49 cents for the full game google has
released their yearly Santa tracker
application with this one you'll be able
to quickly access a countdown to the big
night and track Santa Claus as he makes
his rounds around the world the
application also features a variety of
minigames that you can play to pass some
time some reviewers have noticed the
occasional bug so do look out for that
otherwise the app is completely free to
download and use if you're interested
Hill Climb racing 2 is the successor to
the very popular Hill Climb racing in
this game you'll pick up a vehicle and
of course you'll go racing the game
features the ability to perform tricks
access boosts and there are a variety of
tracks that you can play on it's a 2-d
game and the mechanics are simple so it
shouldn't take you very long to learn it
also has a cartoon graphic style to give
the game an atmosphere of being silly
it supports online multiplayer as well
you can pick it up for free if you don't
mind the in-app purchases clip layer is
a new application from the Microsoft
garage project this is an overlay
application that allows you to quickly
copy and paste items from your screen it
launches using the home button so you'll
need to have this set as your assistant
app once it's done simply long press and
you can copy and paste any text on your
screen very quickly once copied you can
send it to an email address or add it to
wonder list if you prefer it's a
completely free application but do
beware of those early release bugs Sam
Ross 3 is the latest game in the
samurais franchise it's a quirky little
adventure game where you play as a space
gnome with a flute your job is to travel
the cosmos and visit 9 planets to
complete various challenges it has a
strong showing in the graphics sound and
music departments which adds to the
overall ambiance of the title the game
runs for $4.99 but there are no in-app
purchases to get in the way of you
