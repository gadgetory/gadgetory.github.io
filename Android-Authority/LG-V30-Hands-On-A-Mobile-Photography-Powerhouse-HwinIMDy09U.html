everybody and this is the LG V 30 now
bringing the style and elegance of the
LG G 6 with the features that made the V
Series standout LG is hoping the V
Series is really the phone to beat this
year at first glance the LG v 30 looks a
lot like kind of a cross between the
galaxy s 8 and the LG G six mainly
because it now has a glass back
unfortunately the LG v 30 won't be
retaining the metal look that we
actually really liked that industrious
look from the LG v 20 but that doesn't
mean that this phone doesn't have a
design that we still really like there
are curves on the display and also on
the back that really helped with the
ergonomics and at seven point three
millimeters thin and weighing only 158
grams it's actually really comfortable
despite its size and it's really
Pleasant in the hand it's one of the
lighter phones that we've seen recently
and given that there's so much that this
phone can do the fact that it's so light
is really impressive like the g6 before
it the V 30 adopts an all screen mantra
and delivers 82% screen to body ratio
thanks to a six inch quad HD display now
one of the best parts about this display
is that LG has finally gone away from
the IPS LCD and now they're going for
their own P OLED displays this is not
like the AMOLED that you would be used
to from Samsung but it uses the same
general technology resulting in deep
blacks and very vibrant colors so the 18
by 9 aspect ratio makes it onto a larger
body but to the vu series has also been
known for one other standout feature a
great camera package the first step in
this direction is called Sinha video
which aims to allow anyone to produce
videos like a professional using
built-in cinematic effects when taking a
video cine effects allow you to add
various movie grade hues to your videos
and produce the kind of scene that you
want or you can always leave the effect
off in order to basically record log
video which allows you a lot more
freedom when editing it in post another
new feature is the point zoom feature
that is part of Sinha video which aims
to solve a problem that's not really
always apparent to the cinematographer
essentially this allows you to zoom
smoothly into any part of the video so
that you can actually draw the focus to
the correct portion of the frame however
color grading is also a part of the
photography game and LG hopes I can help
introduce a new wave
of mobile photographers to the manual
mode on its phones using the graphic
applications algae runs graph II and
allows users to select a reference
picture from a pre-loaded list in order
to have the correct white balance ISO
aperture and shutter speed applied
directly to the manual camera so that
you know exactly what kind of shot
you're going to get now unfortunately we
were not really able to see this in our
preview units but we will be able to
give you our thoughts on graphy once we
have our hands on a unit that uses it
the main lens is a 16 megapixel shooter
with f 1.6 aperture and the 13 megapixel
wide angle lens returns to this time
with AF 1.9 aperture and to add to the
camera experience LG has added new
crystal clear lenses which are designed
to give an overall realistic image
mainly instead of using just plastic
inside of the lenses this glass will be
able to absorb even more light and thus
make the camera more accurate and more
capable so that's the camera but also
the v-series has also been known as a
multimedia powerhouse and that will
continue this time around as the V 30
will have the hi-fi quad deck onboard
across all of the different devices and
all of this is in a body that is not
only light as a feather but still has
the milspec standard and comes with ip68
water and dust resistance in our first
impressions were really impressed with
what LG has managed to pull off here a
phone that has a large great-looking
screen a lot of features underneath a
dual camera a quad deck and all in the
body that is sleek but still accessible
and along with all of those
specifications you get the snapdragon
835 with 4 gigabytes of RAM and 64
gigabytes of on-board storage in the
standard model and as far as software
additions go you might notice that the
second screen has been put away but
there are a couple of things to replace
it mainly the addition of a floating bar
which is a software version of the
second screen that just sits on one of
the sides of the display tap that area
and you'll be able to scroll among four
different panels but this same second
screen like experience can be found in
the always-on display where the top bar
provides you the same amount of
usability the v30 will go on sale in
South Korea on September 21st followed
by releases in other markets we don't
really know when it will launch in the
US but it should be pretty soon and so
there you have it our first look at the
LG v 30 what do you think of LG's
powerhouse phone especially when you
consider
all of the other flagships that were
starting to see near the end of this
year the V 30 is a powerhouse not only
for audiophiles but also for
photographers and cinematographers
making it maybe one of the most capable
devices that we've used so far it of
course will have to go up against the
likes of the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and
other flagships that we've seen this
year so make sure you stay tuned to
Andrew thority for even more about the
LGV 30 for our comparisons our tests and
of course you can stay tuned for even
more from Aoife in Berlin so make sure
