with Android authority let's take a
closer look it will make ZTE $400.00
flagship the Exxon seven one of the best
smartphones you can buy design is most
certainly a focal point with the axon 7
and that's immediately clear when first
holding the phone in the hand the
designed in the USA tag on the back of
the phone is symbolic of a special
collaboration between ZTE and design
works a BMW Group subsidiary that's
right the same company that designs
luxury cars helped with the Exxon 7th
design thanks to design works experience
and understanding a premium design the
axon 7 is an unmistakable beauty and in
the hand it feels like a single piece of
hardware one that seems remarkably
continuous and that's not just because
of its curved shape that makes it feel
surprisingly natural on the hand but
also because of its smooth edges those
side edges are complemented further by
the shampoo running along the front of
the axon which meets up with the
beautifully curved glass all of this
makes the axon 7 very comfortable to use
even the aluminum feel superior it's
cool to the touch and soft in the hand
it's strong to helping make the phone
virtually unbendable there are also some
smaller touches here and there that make
the axon 7 more pleasant to use the
button placement is a great example it
means that you won't be needing to do
any complex hand gestures to do
something as simple as turn the volume
up the recessed fingerprint reader is
also quite nice as it makes finding the
reader much easier it could be argued
that the axon lines claim to fame is its
reputation for offering a class-leading
audio experience and with the exon 7 CT
has undoubtedly turned it up a notch
with dual independent - audio chips the
AKM ak4 96 1 and I am a K 4 for 9 0 just
to give you an idea of how premium these
chips are it would cost over $3,000 to
buy both a recorder and audio player
using these chips but with the axon 7
you pay much less and get a better more
portable experience for recording the
dual mic setup is
optional and you can record Avenue
directionally for up to eight meters
away audio through the headphone output
is expected ly clean loud and full and
gives many of the 600 to 700 other
flagships a run for their money but it's
not just the hi-fi audio output that's
all the rave as the xn7 s dual
front-facing stereo speakers are
incredible you really have to listen to
them in person to get the full effect
but I can assure you with Dolby Atmos
surround sound technology in an N base
enhancer these are largely unmatched in
quality what that means for you the end
user is that sound is louder and fuller
so it's a much more immersive experience
than other smart phones anything from
browsing through music on Spotify to
watching a movie in Netflix is superior
on the axon 7 thanks to the speakers and
since they do get pretty loud it makes
it easy to share content with friends
without having to hold the phone close
to your ears or having to share
headphones just to hear what's being
played the camera on the Exxon 7 is a
pleasure to use and it mostly starts
with a shooting experience the camera
apps automatic mode is easy to use and
turns on things like HDR and night mode
automatically this definitely is a great
idea as the vast majority of users just
want to take a picture with that said
the Exxon 7 offers a great amount of
manual control as well everything from
shutter speed to ISO to focus is
controllable with simple sliders it's
nice that ZTE is giving professionals
many options here while still providing
a great auto experience there are a
number of different filters available
for use as well and they can be cool to
play around with the camera apps
built-in features are also particularly
noteworthy you can do panorama
slow-motion up to 240 yes a time-lapse
or to a live photo live photos aren't
necessarily unheard of in the smartphone
game but it's not too often that we see
these features available on Android it
can be really cool in certain situations
as the app will essentially create a few
seconds of motion and then create a jet
the camera software is very useful
overall but of course we can't forget to
mention the X on sevens camera Hardware
it's 20 megapixels so there's plenty of
room for cropping and the F 1.8 aperture
can allow you to get some nice-looking
bokeh
and there is optical image stabilization
or oh is on board which actually moves
the camera around to compensate for
handshake or other sorts of motion we've
seen this before on more expensive
smartphones but it's impressive that ZTE
was able to bring this to the affordable
Exxon 7 for video recording the xn7 can
do up to 4k and either h.264 or h.265
codecs and video looks pretty good too
although I'll let you be the judge for
yourself the most impressive part of the
axon 7 is not a single part but rather
the combination of parts at such an
affordable price for 200 to $300 less
than comparable offerings you get much
more this is most certainly flagship
level hardware put in a very
well-rounded affordable package and the
fact that it's dual SIM and unlocked for
all major carriers in the u.s. is a
major selling point for those who don't
want to commit to a single cell phone
carrier or need the freedom to switch
between them VG's premium two-year
warranty passport 2.0 is an unexpected
addition as well and gives you some
pretty great coverage in case you do end
up needing help all things considered
this is an awesome deal through and
through and could easily replace a
monthly Insurance Program which can be
quite expensive and there you have it a
closer look at the ZTE axon 7 please be
