release but the next sony flagship has
arrived what does the update bring to
the Xperia table well let's find out
because it's Josh magar from Android 30
what's going on everybody and this is
the Sony Xperia z2 from a first glance
you might not realize right away that
you're holding the new version of Sony's
Xperia flagship much of what you
remember from the original Xperia z1
returns here you still get the aluminum
frame all around that's pretty much puts
together the two panels of tempered
glass that comprise the front and back
however there is a bit of a lip to the
frame that sticks out just a little bit
which is quite the opposite of the
smoother rounded edges of the Xperia z1
it's not uncomfortable but it is
definitely noticeable and as far as the
profile goes it's just about the same
size as the original Xperia z1 just a
smidgen taller and just a smidgen
narrower so if you were alright with the
original Omni balanced design this will
feel completely familiar when you look
closely at the front you'll notice
little slits at the top and bottom these
are the front-facing speakers that are a
welcome change but we'll get to the
quality of them in a little bit the back
of the phone is a familiar slab of glass
that has the sony logo the Xperia logo
and the G lens optics flaps for the
microSD and SIM slots as well as the
micro USB charging port or on the sides
the one on the left for the SIM tray and
charging port is a little peculiar
though as it isn't made of two different
flaps but instead one large one exposing
a little more of the phone's innards
than I might like but those flaps do
mean water and dust proofing so I guess
I can't complain that much luckily this
this helped by the inclusion at least in
this version of the phone of a charging
dock that takes advantage of the side
pins that since the Xperia Z I always
thought we're not being properly
utilized and unfortunately while the
phone basically isn't bigger than it was
before the handling is still just
outside comfortable for one-handed usage
some hand gymnastics will be required
for tasks like typing and definitely for
reaching elements at the top of the
screen if you are hoping to find drastic
changes when it comes to the design of
the Xperia z2 well you're basically
just not getting it here but this is
Sony style through and through and if
you like what Sony brings to the
smartphone table then you will find that
Sony has kept its own unique identity in
the update to their flagship phone what
is impressive about the experience d2 is
that they were able to increase the size
of the screen without increasing the
size of the phone but there is a reason
for that
in the original Xperia z1 many users
were unhappy about the
larger-than-average bezel sizes so in a
pretty brilliant move Sony got a larger
5.2 inch 1080p display into the new
iteration by shrinking some of that
extra space they didn't stop there
however as the display has added live
color LED technology alongside the
triluminos and x-reality engine
basically that means adding extra colors
to the IPS matrix resulting in a display
with an even wider color gamut what
might have been slightly washed out
before is now incredibly vivid and the
most striking change for any experience
better viewing angles
Sony seems to have gotten it right this
time around creating a display that
makes media a blast but is also now an
even better performer in all other
respects it should come as no surprise
that this flagship update comes with the
best processing package available the it
Snapdragon 801 clocked in at 2.3
gigahertz with the audrina 330 and 3
gigabytes of RAM I've had no issues with
the general usage of this phone being
able to play intensive games like
anomaly 2 and easily going through
various tasks like checking and posting
to Facebook and then playing YouTube
videos to even downloading and listening
some podcasts all in the same run I will
admit that I did find some stutter in
the UI here and there and the occasional
pause when entering the recent apps
screen but they don't break the flow and
are probably more to do with the UI than
the processing package the other bits
and pieces found in the Xperia z2
continue to add to the general
experience especially considering all of
them are well protected from the
elements due to the IP 58 certification
the microSD card slot is now becoming a
trove of flagship devices finally but
Sony has always added them into theirs
and the z2 is no exception all of the
available connections are available here
in the Xperia z2 including NFC as is
denoted by the little mark right here
and
the ability to connect a DualShock 3
controller to the phone using a USB OTG
cable which unfortunately was not
included in this package the
front-facing speakers are always an
exciting prospect but proved to the only
decent at best with the Xperia z2 sound
isn't very rich at all and it doesn't
get all that loud perhaps only loud
enough for personal enjoyment but
definitely not loud enough for anyone
else to enjoy call quality was of little
trouble when I use this phone on the
t-mobile network with really no
complaints on either end and in talking
about the battery you get a sizable 3200
milliamp hour unit in here and it does a
good job of powering the phone for a
good while however I do have to give
credit to this phone's wonderful standby
time and power saving features here's a
look at a typical day of using the
Xperia z2 going from 100% to 75% which
was around two and a half hours with
half of that time being with the screen
on time now if I were to continue using
the phone in that level of usage which
almost never occurs on the phone we'll
probably tuck her out as it did around
the 11 or 12 hour mark but what great
standby time the general user will
definitely get through a full day and
then some with the Xperia z2 especially
if you take advantage of the slew of
power saving features already built in
Sony made a bit of a splash by putting a
powerful 20.7 megapixel F 2.0 G lens in
the Xperia z1 that turned out rather
lacking in the processing department is
there a worthwhile update in this new
version well first let's talk about the
app which retains the general look and
menus including the mode selector 4k
video vine recording time shift and
augmented reality apps are all available
to add more fun to your smartphone
photography admittedly some of them are
more useful than others
superior auto which I generally believed
to be a good automatic mode returns but
it still holds a limitation of only
working with 8 megapixels or lower the
manual mode allows for a bit of freedom
but the most notable change is the
addition of a 15 point 5 megapixel 16 by
9 setting now I almost never shoot at 4
by 3 so finally being able to at least
somewhat take advantage of the high
megapixel count is a big deal to me but
the other side of the coin is that you
can't select scene modes in any
adding over 8 megapixels and as far as
the picture quality goes there has been
improvement as the darker areas that
used to be all smudgy in the Xperia z1
are definitely less so here the level of
grain is still pretty high though but
color does tend to be captured pretty
well and great pictures are definitely
possible with the G lens the low
aperture you're working with will get
you some really nice bokade backgrounds
but it also requires you to be pretty
precise with your focal points the level
of detail you can get when focused
perfectly is there while other spots
seem to be blurred but are really just
being treated outside of the aperture
level the super large 20.7 megapixel
pictures can yield great shots but
without scene modes to better take
advantage of your situations you're left
with basically just a huge raw capture
of your scene and without an exceptional
level of sharpness to them to justify
cropping this kind of dulls the high
megapixel excitement you'll get more
consistently enjoyable pictures by
taking advantage of the settings like
macro or HDR that are only available by
lowering down to 8 megapixels so it's
just a huge bummer that 20.7 megapixels
turns out to be moral novelty than
ultimately useful stay tuned to our
channel for an upcoming feature focus
video that will be a camera shootout
showing you even more examples coming
from the Sony Xperia z2 and finally in
software we find the Xperia or Timescape
UI once again with little changes to the
general formula but once again that
might be a strong point the interface
that is actually quite close to stock
Android continues to bring simplistic
elegance to the Android fold with some
quintessential Sony style as you can see
in this ps3 inspired live wallpaper
aside from a pullover for some simple
settings in the app drawer you have the
familiar horizontal page layout the
notification drop-down is still of a
dark motif but now includes useful power
widgets that are customizable another
Sony Xperia trope returns with the small
apps found in the recent apps screen and
our small overlay apps that you can use
for quick multitasking they're nice but
ultimately weren't tools that I used
often and finally Sony adds in their own
media apps like the Walkman which was
always attractive to me and would be
used if my music wasn't already in the
cloud the album gallery app also and the
movies app does include a nice
connection to a podcast aggregator that
I actually
found quite useful now all of these apps
connect to Sony's own unlimited media
shop where you can buy movies and music
aside from the occasional occasional
stutter that I already mentioned earlier
the UI found in Xperia z2 is another
example of how when you keep it simple
you keep it fast the Xperia U eye does
capture the essence of the stock Android
experience without adding too much to
the general formula and also it still
flies the Sony flag proudly while we
don't know the exact details of the
experience z2 is released in the States
it's probably going to come to t-mobile
but until then you can get your hands on
an unlocked Sony flagship for the high
premium of at least $700 and so there
you have it the Sony Xperia z2 is this a
big leap from the original z1 plainly
put it is not the better screen updated
software and only somewhat enhanced
camera experience however do seem to fit
with this six-month window between
releases that Sony apparently wants to
show us that if it isn't broke you don't
really have to fix it if you really love
to the Xperia z1 and are in line for an
upgrade you'll probably like this update
to the phone that you enjoy new users
can come straight to the z2 if they want
to remain on the bleeding edge or they
can look to the z1 for a slightly
cheaper but also slightly lesser
experience comparatively MVM Sony
continues to move forward and get it
right with their experience and it looks
like they're perfectly happy doing so
little by little so as always thank you
guys very much for watching and I hope
you enjoyed this review of the Sony
Xperia z2 is it a big update from the
Xperia z1 no not by a longshot but is it
still a good phone absolutely so stay
tuned for the rest of my z2 coverage
including the camera shootout in which
you'll be able to see for yourself even
more examples of the camera quality and
