this is joe hindy from android authority
calm and today we'll be taking a look at
wipeout it's available in the Google
Play Store for a dollar ninety-nine the
game is pretty easy to navigate the top
row is your game modes below that is a
way to access tutorial mode brie can
learn how to play the game next to that
is where you can view your stats then of
course there's a Settings button below
all of that you can find links to
facebook twitter and ABC once you're
ready to play you select season mode if
you're unfamiliar with wipeout it's a
popular TV show on ABC where people
navigate obstacle courses for prize
money this game is no different you'll
select a character with an ability to
duck dip dodge and dive through
obstacles each character has a different
speed agility and stability score which
determines how well they do in certain
areas once you select your character you
can select a helmet that grants special
powers some have the ability to jump
higher slow down time to get through
particularly difficult obstacles or even
glide gracefully back to the ground
unlocking a helmet means it's yours
forever but you can only use them for
one round of action once you've selected
everything it's time to play if you've
launched wipeout on TV then you know how
this works you use screen taps and drags
with your left handed control character
movement you screen taps and drags with
your right hand to jump duck and dive in
each round to play you must navigate the
obstacle course and the target time
specified in the top left if you don't
you're knocked out of the competition
and you must start over from the
beginning wait but includes most of the
obstacles found in the TV show including
the famous big balls which are featured
in nearly every competition if an
obstacle knocks you off the path you'll
restart from your last checkpoint so you
can try again each competition lasts for
three rounds in the first round you must
get the target time in the second round
you not only have to complete it in the
target time but you can only fall off
the level five times if you are knocked
off a sixth time the game ends in the
final round you must beat the target
time to win the match however in the
final round if you don't get it you'll
still get second or third place along
with the prize money as you progress the
levels we get harder in the target times
will get shorter the prize money also
increases watching your character get
mauled repeatedly by difficult obstacles
is both funny and rage inducing the game
itself is pretty fun to play when it's
added up we gave gameplay 4 out of 5
stars the graphics and wipe out or
everything they need to be it's not
state-of-the-art or anything like that
but it's clear enough to understand
what's going on the colors in each round
matches the theme of the level overall
and everything feels like it's in the
right place character and level design
are also adequate if not a little above
that there are a few customizations to
make characters look different but it's
not enough to detract from the point of
the game the levels are designed based
on the obstacles from the
TV show so fans of the series we're
familiar with how they all work in terms
of design and looks wipeout is pretty
well done so we gave graphics of value
of 3.5 out of 5 we're not going to beat
around the bush with replay value
because there really isn't any once you
finish the game the only thing left to
do is play time trials however
developers have left little clothes in
the menus that more content will be
added eventually there is plan to do
until then but if you manage to get to
the end you're at the end so we gave
replay value at 2 out of 5 rating
overall wipeout is a pretty fun game
while the obstacles are mostly the same
concepts they're executed in different
ways in each level to keep them fresh
the characters don't mean much to the
game outside of their attributes so that
makes it easier to laugh at them when
they're concussed repeatedly by swinging
bars or spring-loaded platforms there
are six events total in the game each
with varying difficulties the earlier
difficulties are pretty easy but the
later ones they can get a little
ridiculous based on some of the menus it
appears as though developers are still
working on adding content for wipeout so
what you see isn't all of what you're
getting given the fun gameplay the
imminent promise of content expansion
and the senseless beating your character
takes every round we think the game is
worth the dollar 99 and gave it an
overall value of 3.5 out of 5 stars once
again I'm Joe Hindy from android
