now hey everybody on Chris what you ask
we answer its android authority QA for
july third 2013 den asks Chris what do
you think about the acer liquid e2 and
what is the best phone in that price
range well I haven't tried it myself but
looking at the specs as an mtk6589
chipset quad-core cortex a7 CPU gig of
ram 2,000 men power battery none of
that's too bad now it doesn't have an HD
display but 960 x 540 isn't bad
especially for a phone around three
hundred dollars my own personal pick in
that price range would be the google
nexus for it either matches or exceeds
the e2 in pretty much every category but
it's not without its downsides like the
lack of LTE doh lab says i'm moving from
an iphone and wanted to ask about
chinese smartphones i'm looking for
something nicely spectin mtk6589t or
Snapdragon 600 chip 2 gigs of ram full
HD in the price range of around 250 to
300 dollars what are your thoughts well
if you're looking for a Snapdragon 600
it's a little harder to find a pic in
your price range but with the other
chipset you've got a lot of options now
the huawei ascend d2 meets all your
criteria but it's out of your price
range a little bit still if you can
stretch the extra cash i'd recommend one
otherwise what you're going to have to
do is just go start pouring over reviews
and pay attention to with the specs you
want and pay attention in the price
range really that's the best advice I
can give you right now Anthony asks when
will the new firmware update for the
galaxy s4 come out in the US the one
that allows us to move apps to an SD
card well that's a tough one I couldn't
find any official announcement of when
the update would be rolling out in the
US even though it started rolling out
elsewhere last month now it's possible
that there won't be an announcement and
it'll just start showing up on phones
keep your eyes out for that but we'll
probably see an announcement first we
don't know yet but stay tuned and
hopefully we'll let you know once we
know britvic asked will the samsung
alex e note 3 really be even bigger than
the note 2 well there are a lot of
rumors flying around about the Galaxy
Note 3 and since nothing's really nailed
down yet it's hard to tell what's true
and what isn't but a recent rumor did
suggest that the display would indeed be
bigger than the note 2 specifically it
said that the display would be five
point seven inches compared to the note
two is five and a half inch display it's
not much bigger but it's enough that it
could count again we don't know what's
going to happen at this point but I have
a very good feeling that Samsung would
like to keep the device size about the
same size as the note 2 while increasing
the display size kind of like they did
with the s4 that would definitely be a
win-win situation for fans and I'm sure
that's something Samsung would like to
make happen if they can John asks when
is the release date for the sony xperia
z in canada well it seems like Sony's
been teasing Canadians about the
possibility of an Xperia Z through a
canadian carrier since back in January
while the company hasn't officially
ruled it out they also won't say when or
if it's going to happen at all either
about the closest we got was a few
months ago when it looked like the
Xperia Z was finally coming to Canada
but it turned out they were talking
about the Xperia tablet Z not the phone
that said there is still a chance so
there might be hope don't give up just
yet zani says my galaxy s3 charge is
really slowly now taking about 12 hours
or more to charge from twenty percent to
one hundred percent how can I fix this
now there's a possibility that it could
be your battery starting to malfunction
but you didn't mention any other
symptoms so I don't think that's the
case not to mention there's a fairly
common issue with the galaxy s3 where
the cable that ships with the device is
a little faulty basically what happens
is after a while it will start to break
a little bit inside but not so much that
it doesn't charge over time it'll start
to intermittently disconnect as the
phone is charging but not so much that
you even notice anything what happens
here is the galaxy s3 software pays
attention to this and slows down the
rate of charge leaving you with a phone
that takes about 12 hours to charge so
what you want to do first is replace
your cable if you can if that doesn't
help try replacing the charger that
still doesn't
help you might have a problem with your
battery but I doubt you're going to have
to go that far and that about wraps it
