Authority and today we're taking a
closer look at the Huawei p9 more
specifically the software experience on
the p9 now if you want a more in-depth
video on the p9 as a whole make sure to
check out the full review which will
either be linked in the description
below or up top in a card with that
being said let's go ahead and check out
Huawei software on the p9 and see
exactly what the experience is like
so the p9 is running on android
marshmallow out of the box but unlike
the Nexus 6p another Huawei made device
the p9 is not running on a pier stock
Android experience instead you have
Huawei's emotion UI or emui and on the
p9 you're getting version 4.1 if you've
used a bla way made device in the past
especially some of the more recent ones
these software experience will feel very
familiar there's really no getting
around it Huawei skin on top of Android
looks and feels a lot like iOS and even
functions a little bit like iOS there's
no app drawer obviously which is nothing
new to Huawei devices or any Chinese OEM
for that matter so there's not much in
the way of organization outside of
simply using folders the icons are
rounded off squares that are slightly
colorful and cartoonish and you can even
swipe down on any home screen to start a
search just like iOS as far as the rest
of its appearance it hasn't changed
drastically from the last couple of
versions of emotion UI there's a lot of
transparencies across the board like the
folders the widgets and the notification
panel which still features the typical
Huawei setup with a panel for
notifications on the left side and a
separate panel for common shortcuts like
Wi-Fi GPS and Bluetooth on the right
side these shortcuts can also be edited
to your liking and replace with a
selection of a few other shortcuts that
you may find more useful over the
default shortcuts
even though Huawei skin feels very
similar to iOS and changes a lot of what
we know from stock Android there's
actually a lot to like here let's start
from the outside and work our way in
starting with the lockscreen so the
first thing you'll notice about the
lockscreen are these high-quality
wallpapers that Huawei calls covers
which we've seen before in other Huawei
phones they change each and every time
you wake and sleep the device and when
you swipe up to unlock it does this zoom
in effect it's very subtle but it looks
real
cool you can also manually switch
between covers by swiping up from the
bottom of the lock screen and hitting
the previous or next buttons if you want
you can customize these covers by adding
your own wallpapers or even use photos
that you've taken with the camera
swiping up from the bottom of the lock
screen also gives you quick access to
some common and pretty useful functions
like the sound recorder calculator
flashlight and the camera what I really
like about the lock screen though is how
it displays notifications for the most
part it looks a lot like stock Android
lockscreen notifications but they've
been treated with this transparent flash
frosted glass effect to match the rest
of the transparencies that you see
across the entire OS it's just a really
nice touch that makes the notifications
look a little bit more elegant and still
allows your wallpaper to shine through
now even though emotion UI is
aesthetically a very heavy skin and
changes a lot about Android the version
that's on the p9 surprisingly comes with
very little bloat outside of the basic
applications there's not a whole lot
that comes pre-installed on the p9 and
the only real bloatware that you'll find
is this folder full of really cheesy
games but thankfully while we does let
you uninstall them there isn't a whole
lot in terms of customization that
emotion UI allows you to do but there
are a few things that you can change up
long press on the home screen will give
you the typical customization options
like wallpapers and widgets but you can
also change the home screen transition
animations to something more animated
and the home screen grid size can be
bumped up to as high as 5x5 to allow you
to fit more apps and widgets onto a
single screen there are built-in themes
to let you customize the look and feel
of the icons wallpaper and lock screen
but it's not a full-on theme engine or
theme store like you would find on a
Samsung or HTC device it would have been
nice to have more themes to pick from
but you do have a few options so it's
still better than having nothing at all
a feature that Huawei has been working
on for the last couple of years is
called knuckle sense and is still
available here on the p9 if you're not
familiar with knuckle sense it's a
feature that allows you to use your
knuckles to do various different
gestures for specific functions for
example you can double tap with a single
knuckle to take a screenshot or if you
want to start and stop a screen
recording you can do so by double
tapping with two knuckles knuckle sense
also lets you crop out areas of the
screen take a scrolling screen shot and
open specific applications by drawing
letters
on the screen but this is where it gets
inconsistent and feels really gimmicky
in order to get best results you have to
use the very back of your knuckle which
just doesn't feel natural or intuitive
and even then it still has a hard time
detecting when you're using your
knuckles some of the gestures like
double tap to take a screenshot work
really well but the other more complex
gestures really shows that knuckle sense
definitely still needs some work before
it can become a reliable feature one of
the biggest and most notable changes to
emotion UI is the camera software which
also had a lot to do with new camera
sensor on the p9 it's really clean and
easy to use and navigating the interface
is all based on swipes so if you swipe
up from the bottom or left side if
you're in portrait this will open up all
the different shooting modes and the p9
has a lot to offer when it comes to
shooting modes swiping in from the
opposite side will take you to the
camera settings where you can adjust the
resolution audio and other typical
camera functions if you swipe outwards
from the shutter button you can access
the cameras pro mode and I really like
this because it makes it really quick
and easy to switch back and forth
between auto and pro the pro mode is
exactly what you would expect it gives
you many patrols over ISO exposure
shutter speed out of focus and white
balance just like you would get on a
DSLR but that's really going to do it
for this feature focus on the Huawei p9
overall I think there's a lot to like
about it despite the fact that it
deviates a lot from stock Android but
what do you guys think about emotion UI
