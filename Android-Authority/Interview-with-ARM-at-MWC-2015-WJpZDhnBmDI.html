from Mobile World Congress 2015 and I'm
delighted to be at the arm booth again
with a favorite of mine mr. James Bruce
who is the director of mobile at arm how
are you today sir I'm very one it's
great to speak to you again Darcy thank
you very much for your time sir so we've
seen a lot of great things here at
Mobile World Congress 14-nanometer SOC
from XE notes in the galaxy s6 and a lot
of other exciting stuff what do you what
are you most impressed with that the
show so far oh that's actually a really
tough question and I think the sort of
answer to that is you know no matter
what price point you're at there's been
some great handsets I mean obviously the
galaxy s6 with the 14 nanometer arm SOC
is very impressive at the premium and
then you can go all the way down to some
of the handsets that we've got that
we're showing like a thirty dollar
spreadtrum handset with a quad a seven
or a $65 quad a 53 LT handset martyt 720
so I think that's a really important
message from mwc now is you know no
matter what price point you're buying a
handset at you do have some great
choices great performance and you know
it's a great time to buy a smartphone I
couldn't agree more so just taking a
look back you know we spoke last year at
mobile Congress you know it was a galaxy
s5 which was debuted around that time
what kind of performance gains are we
looking at towards the upper tier of the
market our end of the market
year-over-year you think so I mean it's
always a sort of difficult one to answer
directly but I mean certainly the
performance gains o over forty percent
year-on-year some years it can actually
be almost doubling some years it perhaps
there's only twenty or thirty percent
but I think the really important thing
to emphasize is when you're looking at
the handsets it's not just about the
form
about the overall user experience so if
you have the sort of galaxy s5 and the
galaxy s6 in your hand it's completely
different and what I mean by that is
just the changes in the mechanics the
quality of the display and also the
camera I mean you've suddenly gone from
a sensor that wasn't optically image
stabilized to a sense of that is so it's
all those changes combined that deliver
that new user experience the consumer
you know it's really interesting that
you say that now I take a look back you
know the part the arm printer ecosystem
is so vast and it continues to grow you
know you all the way from rockchip all
the way up to qualcomm you know XD notes
we have the rise of high silicon out of
Huawei and even LG now is participating
in SOC architecture you just talk a
little bit about about that yes so I
think what you're seeing is we have lots
of partners in the arm ecosystem and in
the mobile space we have a great range
of companies and I think it's really
important from the perspective of the
consumer because if you just have one
chip supplier you know all the handsets
are really just going to be variations
on the theme when you've got all these
different companies competing against
each other trying to do things different
that's when you get the diversity in
smartphones those differences and that's
where it's great to be a consumer
so we're quite familiar you know with
arm reference designs you know your
leadership with an IP itself but can you
just talk a little bit about the GPU
space because we were just over with
imagination and obviously Apple licenses
their GPU architecture and now the rise
of MIPS which is supported by android
5.1 lollipop and beyond but if you could
just talk a little bit about arms Mally
GPU architecture relative to power be
our imagination and you know feasibly
the future as well so I think the
important thing is really sort of just
talk about you know the various Molly
devices that we've seen at the show I
think it's really impressive now that
are mollys now the number one licensed
GPU IP is shipped over a billion units
and I think there's some great devices
you're seeing sort of T 720 @ sort of
$65 T 760 based devices starting at
three hundred and I'm sure she's talked
about that some premium devices using
the Marley t 760 and I think it's
certainly from the perspective of the
actual use of these phones I think the
important thing is really to look at the
capabilities of the GPU and certainly as
an Android user what I'm excited about
is as android 3.0 sorry as opened less
3.0 3.1 comes into the market how the
games developers take advantage of that
and also you're seeing sort of
supporting technologies for example we
had the enlightened announcement
yesterday with the new lighting
technology having that great and just
using the term eye candy ena that big
change in your gaming capabilities in
the handset I think it's going to be a
really interesting year to be a gamer on
the smartphone
so I mean we continue to see massive
performance gains you know the utility
and the performance of these devices at
all ends of the pricing spectrum are
just continue to improve how close do
you think we are to achieving truly
desktop like performance in a mobile
device to having the one device that can
be the primary and they are so I mean
obviously if you let's say a
professional designer or if you're using
AutoCAD then you're still going to use
I'll get back to desktops but I mean as
a typical consumer or someone who's you
know really just someone who uses office
on their desktop or laptop I think we're
almost at that point now and I think
it's going to be really interesting to
see over the next couple of years how
the form factors and the connectivity
changes to take advantage of that
increase in performance on your
smartphone but another exciting
corollary to that is a the launch of
ddr4 ram in a mobile device you know
industry-first the galaxy s6 is bringing
and we spoke with micron and it looks
like they're packing a lot more
performance finally guys yeah absolutely
and I mean low-power ddr4 is vital for
delivering that user experience and I
think it's very good that you brought
that up because quite often when you
talk about smartphone performance we
talk about things like CPU clock speeds
GPU but you really do need that memory
subsystem to actually transfer the data
to these compute units and low-power
ddr4 is that next stage so we're going
to be speaking again next year oh but
just so perhaps we could have a little
bit of a look into the future are we
going to be seeing more versions of a
the big little type design or is there
anything exciting that arm is working on
that you could shed some light on for
the future well I mean obviously big
little is going to progress I I really
look at 2015 is a year the big little
you've obviously got these up to a 50
threes where they're effectively doing
two clusters one running very fast one
running
efficiently and I think we've asli
announced cortex a 72 but if I was to
give it to you in one sound by I think
it's more of the same but better you can
see that continuous innovation that's
between our partners and also that
should we say friendly competition that
drives and to do better and that s and I
think I come I'll come to mwc 2016 and
there'll be lots of new handsets that
I'll be really excited about and that's
the great thing about the sort of
smartphone business is that every year
you come to the show and you're always
excited
I mean there's not a lot that we can
discuss more obviously the rise of em
bed you know armors still continue to
work with a lot of developers and
opening up the ecosystem providing the
resources so that people can you know
really grow mobile technology and with
the rise of wearables even though still
a relatively small product category now
probably double or triple in size by the
time we have a conversation next year
and that's the great thing about the arm
ecosystem if you actually look at harm
what we do is we were actually quite
boring we supply important IP and it's
our silicon partners and OEMs who
actually come out with this cool new
stuff but sometimes you just don't even
think about and that's why it's so
exciting to work for arm because now two
years down the line you see stuff went
wow I never even thought about it yeah
but I want to say a huge thank you for
your time it's always at privilege and
are able to speak with you James so and
it's it's always great speaking to you
Darcy thanks so much you all right
