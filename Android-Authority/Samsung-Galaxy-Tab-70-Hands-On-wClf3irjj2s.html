Authority and today you are seeing the
Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 plus hands on
video so the tap runs on honeycomb
together with a TouchWiz UX interface as
usual all this honeycomb pictures are in
the tablet samsung also added this set
us behind the bottom that allows pop up
and more apps to be reveal very quick
and easy access to everything it runs
honeycomb 3.2 and this I believe is the
latest version of honeycomb as you can
see
the display is pls LCD and it looks
fantastic to the eye is almost almost
indistinguishable compared to super
imola or AMOLED technology it looks
bright we're it it feels great to the
touch as you can see let me try playing
something for you this day this is a
video
currently it's running 1080 P is full HD
the clarity is amazing and if I just
freeze it at certain moments you can see
it's very clear
the detail of the fine details are
amazing and that's also this Creek
button right here at the bottom so i can
let you take snapshots and you can save
them and you will appear in your gallery
if not is it looks exactly like the ass
memo on on the galaxy note and you can
basically doodle on your screen shots
before saving them so it's a nice
addition to have their if you prefer not
to have the screenshot you could also
change in the screen I believe quick
launch exactly you can change it to a
camera
screen-capture applications such camera
so we can have a quick and convenient
usage of the body and the recent apps
book the same in honeycomb so we
actually ran a quadrant test earlier and
the results are amazing quad route run
benchmark the device utilizes the same
mali-400 GPU that is in the galaxy s2
and this is one of the older GPU in the
market but it fast well if as very well
on devices as a result as fascist
beautiful to behold especially on the
screen graphics looks amazing
as you can see 3d rendering is not a
problem the smooth is buttery well
honeycomb is hardware accelerator and
that could attribute a lot of
performance upgrades and enhancements
that
can see is 3196 my probably not be clear
in the video but it's 3,000 plus so the
performance from this tablet is amazing
you can touch the science to move
quickly between home screens tap to move
the messaging app is amazing one sign is
the list of contacts while your messages
appear here the browser on another hand
is interesting let's go to enter
authority shall we
well
the US has 21 make megabytes per second
HISHE s.d PE if I'm not mistaken this is
the brow the mobile version let's go to
the just launched this as well so it's
tab browsing just like honeycomb and one
of the hidden features of dense is the
ability to change your user agent just
type about semicolon user eating
and and you'll bring up a list of user
agents that you could use and let's say
I run on desktop and everything will
appear as though you are seeing it from
the desktop the browser is smooth rather
horizont horizontally or vertically the
smooth the tab browsing books
fantastically as you will expect some
song device to be there is also a pen
memo app that is similar to the one
found on the Galaxy Note and with this
pen memo you could do the same doodles
save it and you can actually view all
off
your memos on
Penn memo pad where's in here so it
works exactly like the galaxy know
except that there is no way for you to
create folders to organize your memos
but it is it is a nice addition to the
galaxy tab 7 power plus ok let's go back
to quadrant
if you look at this system information
it runs mali-400 where is it
this is the same process as sgs2 so with
mali-400 yes mali-400mp is the same
processor as the galaxy s which explains
the smoothness of the device and in
terms of sensors this accelerometer
gyroscope magnetic field sensor
orientations as a proximity sensor light
sensor and the normal things one thing
it doesn't have is a barometer that
there is pretty much standard Ice Cream
Sandwich level this device should not
have a problem getting ice cream
sandwich it's more than capable enough
to run ice cream sandwich but barometer
isn't available on this device but what
is available here is something that is
rather unique there's a infrared
transmitter and this month's well we
peel which is as much remote device that
you can control your home and taemin
systems your TV's you know
it smooth is fantastic he has a dialer
they can make phone calls with though I
dumps anyone would be crazy enough to be
seen walking around with this new diet
yes nevertheless is a fine device and if
you take pic at this it has gps a gps no
barometer secondary camera which is to
omega secondary camera is here 2
megapixels this is trimming a pixels bit
/y five bluetooth 3.0 accelerometer
compounds
cpu sound vibrator USB 2.0 as well as
USB host if i'm not mistaken there's no
barometer but everything else seems
intact there's no NFC in the asian
version of the tab 7.0 one thing I'm
Marissa prior start this device is the
mali 400 GPU on average if you had sgs2
and you're playing this highly intensive
games like like wine up night or dungeon
defenders you will probably need a very
solid device however although it looks
smooth it is more in the menu and will
probably be a fantastic gaming device
highly intensive 3d games might be a bad
idea for this it is possible that this
is this device isn't yet ready as it is
a brand new but the main problem the
status kind of lagging if you see what
is happening on screen is not as
responsive as you could hope it to be
and it could be a pain for those of you
who need a really really competent
gaming machine and if you have a look at
the sgs2
the difference is astounding mali-400 on
this device is very very smooth but it
doesn't come out on the gal Galaxy Tab
7.0 and let's just go back to that same
level
this is a smooth is this smooth very
smooth ER than what you experience on
the Galaxy Tab 7.0 and I believe this is
attributed to the higher resolution but
this is more of in my opinion
entertainment device that is great for
music for videos especially on the goal
communication like Skype or SMS
messaging emails however it may not be
ideal gaming machine mainly because of
the resolution yes the screen is big is
perfect for gaming however until a
developer support it even more at this
resolution I'm afraid gaming might be
lacking somehow the most recent apps
there
so there it comes with a bounce top
kicker myself empty space after a bit of
your abs on your room it has one
gigabyte of RAM so Graham is about
almost 1 gigabyte once Ted you have
about 300 gram that you can switch apps
with easily and that should be more than
enough for you to do anything that is
intensive multitasking should not be a
problem though is surprising that
Samsung has created a trend using
Polaris on the galaxy note and the sgs2
is a bit surprising that Polaris isn't
included in the list of devices I mean
apps on the device
in terms of multi-touch it can support
up to 10 different touches which is
great overall this is a solid tablet it
is strong it is durable I think this can
easily survive a fall though is probably
a bad idea to drop any of your devices
anyway
creaming a pixel is pretty decent it
does the job but for camera and
photography enthusiasts this might not
be enough for you to work with so is
about 3 megapixels let's go into the
settings is about 3 megapixels but the
camera can actually capture high
resolution 720p and that's HD so this is
a pretty good camera solid enough to do
everyday things but do not expect it to
be able to take high quality in
megapixel stuff so that's about it this
is a pretty good device honeycomb
without a doubt Ice Cream Sandwich will
hit this device probably early two
thousand and tough and smooth is amazing
tab browsing is a dream come true and
that's about it this is the second
generation samsung galaxy tab 7.0 this
is way better than the predecessor it
runs one point two gigahertz eggsy knows
amazing tech smooth lovely the screen is
amazing compared to galaxy s and if you
have a look between this to you really
can't tell a difference which is better
off n and they did a good job with the
IPS LCD design an IPS is pls LCD
apparently one generation after IPS so
all you Apple fans can really have
something to look forward to well that's
about it samsung galaxy tab 7.0 from n
power authority with randy here have a
nice day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
