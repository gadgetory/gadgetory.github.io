look at a pretty interesting development
the Marshall London as a smart phone
made by a speaker and audio company we
were definitely intrigued and we were
excited to get our hands on a review
unit well I've kept pretty mum about
this and I decided to wait until just
after Eva to do this but here it is I
actually have my hands on one thanks to
Marshall and now the charge of agar from
Android Authority what's going on
everybody and here is your unboxing and
first impressions on the Marshall London
and now here we are with the Marshall
London as you can see here the phone is
already pretty much implying view on the
box even on the back right here with the
leather backing that Marshall makes a
lot of their amps and their speakers out
of personally I have a Marshall stand
more and absolutely love the thing but
yeah we have the Marshall London here
and we're doing an unboxing because
Marshall has added in a few really nice
goodies with this particular phone I've
been really waiting to do this and I
decided to wait until just after getting
home from Aoife in order to bring this
to you now starting off right away we
have a pic right here in the middle now
the pig is one of Marshalls signature
icons right here and that's what you
it's what you get right off the bat it
doesn't seem like I can remove it though
which is perfectly fine and there you go
now when you open up the cover it's not
even just the phone itself it's covered
up already and of course on the front
there there motto
long live rock and roll so I'm gonna put
this aside real quick it's gonna be a
little bit unconventional compared to
other unboxings where you just have the
plastic on the front we're actually
going to unwrap this phone which is
really nice
now feasibly you should be able to get
spares for this phone might be a little
bit tougher to find when compared to you
know phones like older Samsung's or
anything like that but we do have the
battery I'm going to go ahead and just
pop that out and you even have long live
rock and roll as part of the battery
design so that's really awesome
pretty funny so here well here was what
here's what I was expecting when
unboxing this phone you have these
Marshall headphones right here now I'm
going to confirm what the actual name of
these headphones are but I actually have
a pair of these already and they work
really great from what I can tell this
particular version if I look closely yes
there are three
who's there that you can use for any
smartphone and they will control the
music and the volume and really I can
already test that these headphones are
pretty awesome already now here's a
really funny part about the charging
cable it also has a very unique design
it is made of a fabric rather than just
a straight-up plastic which is already
pretty cool and should help when in
terms of it tangling so probably won't
tangle as easily then of course it has
that ridged pattern design on the two
ends so really living up to the marshal
design language and so here we are with
the moment of truth we're going to go
ahead and unwrap I hope that I can say
that about this phone the marshal London
right here so Marshall right there
alright and then logging live rock and
roll once again will pop that battery in
we can fire this baby up as if you're
plugging into an amp that's awesome now
of course you're going to be getting
somewhat mid-range specifications here
definitely nothing flagship worthy but
then again they are focusing on the
audio experience being what you're going
to be using here going through some of
the elements here we are dealing with a
pretty pretty standard version of
Android here of course the Android I
want to say lollipop of course let's see
exactly which version it is 5.0 0.2 and
hopefully there'll be some updates in
the future but we already have some of
that Marshall style here that clock
right there is one that I really wish
that I could have for plenty of other
phones and then right over here 101 I'm
sure it's pretty easy to recreate but
it's nicely that's already there off the
bat if we go to the top right here you
see this this Marshall button right here
just go ahead and hit that button and it
will bring down the audio player now
what's great is Marshall has integrated
a number of different streaming players
like SoundCloud Spotify and Mixcloud but
you can also always have your local
music on there as well and what you do
is you can just play on here I'll sign
in to my Spotify soon enough and bring
you how that sounds but really the local
file is at flack if you do a lossless
quality sound file it's probably where
you're going to get the most out of here
alright so going through the
Marshall London right here I did already
put on some of my applications after I
turned on this particular device just so
you can get some examples of what the
Marshall engine is actually like now we
do have a lot of elements from stock
Android this is a pretty vanilla version
of Android with a few extra things built
in some nice features and I also found
out that the volume roller as we'll call
it over here you can actually press it
and it's a shortcut to the camera now we
have an 8 megapixel camera on the rear a
2 megapixel camera on the front and as I
click on that press in on the roller
over here and there we are on the camera
the display is 720p which might be a
little bit of a disappointment but 4.7
inches is the size here at 720p works
just fine on smaller displays like this
anyway but we'll get into more of that
in our full review underneath the
surface we do have the Snapdragon 410
which is a little bit more low spec and
I have already seen some of the slowdown
in trying to install the applications
that I wanted to put on here but nothing
really too out of the ordinary for
something like the Snapdragon 410 and it
is backed by a cirrus logic sound card
you may know cirrus logic as wolfson but
now they have that new name and that is
what you have here for audio processing
so you'll be able to get high fire audio
everything from FLAC files to lossless
audio on here and of course if you were
to hit the button up here you get the
Marshall amp right here that will allow
you to change in the equalizer exactly
what you want the sound to be like so
that's the kind of processing that you
need and of course you have the dual
setup of the headphones up here so I
pointed my microphone this way to the
Marshall London to give you an example
of what the sound would be like just in
this first impressions here and from
what I can tell already from my Spotify
working through this particular
application I do think it's already
pretty great the speaker's are up here
on the top and here on the bottom
underneath the Marshall logo and what
I'm going to do here is just give you an
example using the hip-hop equalization
so you can see that the base is being
bumped up the mids or kind of brought
down a little bit more and we're trying
to do the more extremes here for hip-hop
songs so we have this one right here and
I'm going to go ahead and hit play
actually one thing I did notice is that
the Marshall
button application doesn't really work
with this version of Spotify just yet
that's just been my first impression
thus far I've been able to get it to
pause the music but it's kind of in and
out so I wonder if there's a software
thing going on right now but we do have
this Korean hip-hop song right now that
we're going to do right here this goes
up
to all the hard ropes
let's just do some Bruno Mars just for
the heck of it because there's a lot of
stuff going on there and of course we
have let's go back and hit uptown funk I
have to say undoubtedly my favorite part
about the marshall is its look you just
don't get a phone that looks like this
with Marshalls amp design over on the
side and then of course the features
that are underneath the volume rocker is
really fun to use as well it just kind
of works like a analog to digital input
really it just all it does is just make
the volume go up or down but really it's
a lot of fun to use it and it feels very
analog despite this being of course a
full digital smartphone and then of
course you have the ports on top for
headphone jack and whatnot I am going to
be testing the audio quality of these
using Marshalls own headphones and then
maybe a couple of other ones because
obviously with bluetooth you kind of get
a general standard for all of them so
really the the actual action is going to
be up here and then of course that
Marshall button up top which gives this
a pretty unique feel now before you say
that this phone is actually one that is
just a rebranded let's say Chinese phone
but actually is not the case
they told me at showstoppers at IVA in
Berlin that this phone was completely
designed in Sweden and then manufactured
for sale in England and across parts of
Europe no this phones not coming to the
US though I did tell them that if I were
to review this phone maybe I could make
a case for the fact that this phone
should come to the west because a lot of
people love marshall products here in
the united states and we should really
get more of them so with that in mind
we're going to go ahead and get into our
full review of this i'll be listening to
a lot of music podcasts anything this
phone was marketed as not only being a
phone for just rock and roll listeners
but for literally any other genre in any
other form of music so that's exactly
what i'm going to do with this so keep
it tuned to android thority for all of
our great content and for the upcoming
full review of the marshall london stay
