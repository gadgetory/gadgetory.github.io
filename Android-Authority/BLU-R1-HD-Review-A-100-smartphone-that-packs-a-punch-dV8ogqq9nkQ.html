once again and this time we have a new
budget smartphone this one comes out
only 50 dollars yes the price is pretty
shocking but there is a catch to that
price this is Ben here with and your
authority and let's take a look at the
all-new blue r1 HD now for only 50
dollars you can pick up this phone that
comes with 8 gigabytes of storage and 1
gigabyte of RAM or just add another $10
and you'll get the version that comes
with 16 gigabytes of storage and 2
gigabytes of RAM now at first it seems
like the price is actually unbelievable
but there is some fine print on this one
the blue r1 HD is exclusive for Amazon
Prime members and it will feature offers
and ads that are placed right on the
lock screen which are unremovable yes it
is a bummer you can get a version that
does come without the ads and the not
Amazon Prime exclusive one but there's
another contingency that will jump up
the price to 100 to 110 dollars so will
become twice as expensive
now moving a little back and taking a
look at the design of the phone it is
actually also a surprise when you think
at how much the device actually cost the
thickness of the phone measures at just
under 9 millimeters coming in exactly on
a thin profile of 8.7 millimeters when
you turn it over the r1 HD sports a
plastic back cover with a camera for
treating outward the back cover is
actually not slippery and actually does
well in giving it more grip and an
all-around great handle experience
around the phone there is an aluminum
frame which also houses the volume
rockers and the power button which are
also made up of the same material moving
to the inside the back is removable
which is always a plus for any phone on
the inside you will find your 2 Micro
SIM card slots and a micro SD card slot
for expandable storage for up to 64 gigs
the battery is also seen here which is a
2500 milliamp battery which
unfortunately is not removable but in my
opinion 25 hundred milliamps is a good
amount and to note is usually the
average we see in a smart phone nowadays
during my testing the Arwen HD did last
me approximately eight hours on a medium
to heavy use which included surfing the
web and watching videos as well during
this testing I did set the screen
brightness to maximum and no streaming
fullscreen video and I still didn't have
any trouble getting the r-1 to last or
full day of use the phone does not
include any quick charging abilities but
it's actually really quick and can get
fully charged in about two hours
moving towards the front of the phone
the r-1 HD has a 5-inch HD display with
a non SEL touch panel which is running
1280 by 720 pixels resulting in a pixel
density of 294 pixels per inch
yes that was a mouthful but overall just
sum it up the content does appear sharp
the viewing angles are excellent and the
colours are decent but obviously since
this is an IPS LCD it won't be up to par
to what an AMOLED display could bring
forth protection was not scratched off
even though this is a budget phone the
phone does have cornering Gorilla Glass
3 which will give your smartphone extra
layer protection against scratches
cracks and breakage now you might be
asking Ben this phone seems okay what's
so bad about it being an Amazon Prime
exclusive so the reason why this phone
is an Amazon Prime Minister is that
alongside the display as soon as you
press the power button you're greeted
with an ad now since they know the same
ad will bore you every time they've
decided that every time you do wake up
the phone you will be greeted with a
different ad and from there you can just
swipe up and go into the phone so that's
the only difference that is between the
Amazon Prime and the non Amazon Prime
exclusive one you're just going to have
to see an ad every time you unlock the
phone moving on to the brain of the
phone the inside of the phone is powered
with a 1.3 gigahertz core mediatek 673 5
erm cortex processor with a Mali T 7 21
I'm testing out is a Mac soft version
which comes with 16 gigabytes of
internal memory and 2 gigabytes of RAM
the other version which is also
available is sporting 8 gigabytes of
internal memory coupled with one
gigabyte of RAM is $10 cheaper than this
one for a budget smartphone I really
didn't expect this but the blue r1 HD is
actually running Android 6.0 marshmallow
right out of the box which is impressive
to see on a budget smartphone
considering that the specs are on the
lower tier the blue r 1 HD does tag
alongside 4g LTE bands 2 4 7 and 17 and
also has promised that the 4g LTE band
12 will be available via an over-the-air
update
moving back a little bit the phone
doesn't have much extra features and is
actually a nearly stock version of
Android with an Abbe drawer that flows
vertically and all the other features
give it a very stock look and feel as
well moving towards the bottom of the
screen you will see that there are three
main functions including a back home and
a recent apps function in addition to
everything Google now is also available
with just a press of a button now on a
day-to-day basis I think everything
together actually runs very well and I
haven't noticed any serious lives that
have occurred launching apps doesn't
take much time and you can jump easily
from app to app without any lab gaming
is also fairly fluid as well and it does
a good job in not dropping any frames I
did open Geekbench to see how it
compares to the others and it gave me a
single core score of around 500 and a
multi-core score of around 1600 so
overall you have to keep bringing back
to price for $50.00 there's not much you
can complain about since it is spitting
out some decent reports and it seems
like that it can be used on a daily
basis for an average smartphone user who
doesn't desire too much performance but
just enough to be average and get
through the day moving on to the camera
of this budget phone the camera can be a
hit or miss sometimes the front of the
phone features a 5 megapixel wide-angle
front facing camera with an LED flash
the picture quality is decent and some
problems that will occur is the
overexposure and some noise the rear
facing camera features an 8 megapixel
autofocus camera sensor with an F 2.0
aperture and a 4 P lens a 4 P lens means
that it has four lenses made out of
plastic which gives it more exact
focusing and better correct for
distortions for the rear facing camera
there are some extra modes built in so
you can't shoot like a panoramic picture
if you would want to the picture quality
is decent as seen here for a budget
smartphone but definitely nothing to be
wowed over you will get some overexposed
images and a bit of noise on the overall
picture but with the crack lighting you
can get some decent results as I tried
here at the park video can be recorded
in HD up to 1080p at 30 frames per
second but there are not any extra
features and it seems kind of grainy at
times just like the picture quality
moving right under the camera is where
the speaker is housed now just like the
last blue phone we reviewed the speaker
is also at the back which is not an
ideal location since most of the time
either your finger or your palm will be
placed in this area in terms of sound
quality it is decent and you can crank
up the volume all the way up to the max
without any distortion the heavy bass is
not there but it will still be able to
deliver decent sound with good highs and
good lows it obviously could have been
better with the speaker located
somewhere other than the bag so yeah
even though the specs on this phone is
not something to be going crazy about
this one can be bought for just $50 now
yes it does have some odd shuffling
performance isn't up to par to other big
phones it still does everything that a
phone is supposed to do and it comes in
at a great price for anyone that is on a
tight budget but yeah let me know what
you think about the phone write it down
in the comment section below what
version would y'all
would y'all get the 8 gigabyte version
the 16 gigabyte version what version
would y'all get the Amazon Prime version
