this is April from Android authority HTC
May the first Nexus phone Samsung made
the second and third and LG has just
recently taken its turn with the fourth
in the form of the Google Nexus 4 with
the Samsung Galaxy s3 GTI 9 300
currently among the most sought after
phones around the world
thus the Nexus have enough beef and
charm to steal some of the limelight
from Samsung's phone let's talk about
that in the rest of his review
physically the two phones have almost
similar size and girth the galaxy s3
though is slightly taller and wider than
the Nexus 4 yet it is also thinner and a
bit lighter regardless my hands can't
distinguish which one is heavier the
front gives each phone its distinctive
look on the Nexus 4 it's all glossy
black with no accent at all not even
capacitive buttons it's truly a
minimalist reserved and somewhat
mysterious I actually like this kind of
sly and seductive ambience on the Nexus
4 on the galaxy s3 there's the phone
speaker grille and Samsung logo and
shiny silver and the elongated home
button with silver lining flanked by the
capacitive menu and back buttons
compared to the simple and plain front
on the Nexus 4 the galaxy s3 sprint
appears a bit busy but without
compromising style or class the thing I
like most about the galaxy s3 sprint is
its black blue theme coupled with a
brushed metal finish on its bezel and on
its plastic frame the positioning of the
hardware buttons and ports on the phone
sides are practically similar on both
phones headphone jack at the top side
microUSB port at the bottom side power
button at the right side and the volume
rocker at the left side one difference
between them is that the Nexus 4 stem
trays also here on the left side on the
galaxy s3 its underneath the back cover
also there are Torx screws on both sides
of the microUSB port on the Nexus 4 I
feel that they detract from the Nexus
4's otherwise attractive looks the back
panel is where the Nexus 4 I believe
simply outshines the galaxy s3 in terms
of aesthetics this is a layer of scratch
proof Corning Gorilla Glass 2 which
provides a glossy layer of protection
not just to the 8 megapixel camera but
also to the twinkling crystals
underneath although I personally
it is overkill and something a simple
person like me can live without this
interesting back cover design creates
some kind of three-dimensional illusion
these two logos for example appear to
float in the air when you view the back
panel from a certain angle the Nexus 4's
back certainly makes up for its fronts
simplicity well I don't mind the
crystals I do mind that this back cover
is non removable which means the battery
is not easy replaceable which means I'm
disappointed the back of the galaxy s3
is quite simple no flashy or showy
designs here no glitter or twinkling
crystals just the elegance of simplicity
marked by glossy blueish grey
polycarbonate with a brushed metal
finish the 8 megapixel camera flash and
loudspeaker grille are lined up in a row
at the top as if quietly asserting that
that is the most functional place and
arrangement for the set elements the
Nexus 4 is pretty and extremely
fascinating back panel pales in
comparison to the removability of this
back cover not to mention the galaxy s3s
user replaceable battery there are
several other goodies accompanying this
removable cover for one the microSD card
slot is here such slot is non-existent
on the Nexus 4 which means that the
galaxy s3 lets you enjoy more storage
than what has been built into your phone
another nice thing about this
removability is that of personalize
ability for instance I can check in a
third party battery with bigger capacity
I can replace the back cover with one of
another colour when the current one has
been scratched and gashed too much I can
even replace the back cover with a flap
custom back cover like this one
undoubtedly these two phones have
stunning and terrific displays showing
crisp and vivid images for media
consumption the galaxy s3 is great
because it is brilliant vibrant and
saturated but if like me you prefer a
slightly subdued and more realistic
display the Nexus 4 can deliver quite
well their screen sizes are almost
similar 4.7 inches on the nexus 4 and 4
point 8 inches on the galaxy s3 both in
high definition and both covered in
Corning Gorilla Glass 2 they use
different display technologies true HD
IPS plus technology on the nexus 4 an HD
Super AMOLED on the galaxy s3 the touch
screens on both phones are truly snappy
and very responsive to
navigation viewing media files web
browsing and HD gaming are generally
very fluid in both phones too thanks to
quad-core processing on both phones
however I noticed that the galaxy s3
stalls a little bit when launching apps
I also observed some minor jitter when
scrolling webpages on both phones 1080p
full-hd videos are joy to watch in these
two phones if you desire only pleasure
for watching your videos these two
phones are perfect for the job
I didn't observe any flicker lags that
are or freezing when playing videos on
these phones audio playback is great
plus the equalizer presets the multiband
equalizer and several other audio
enhancements can make music listening
simply wonderful to add to their
processing muscle both phones also come
at standard connectivity features found
in most recent high-end Android phones
2g and 3G Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi direct
Bluetooth NFC and DLNA the eight
megapixel cameras and these two phones
are amazing both are able to capture
crisp and vibrant photos in various
sizes and with no noticeable shutter lag
photos are captured almost as instantly
as tapping the shutter autofocus is
quick too these cameras can record
videos up to 1080p full HD resolution
but you can also choose lower
resolutions the Nexus 4 brings all the
standard features provided by the
Android 4.2 stock camera app including
the photos for your function and
time-lapse recording the galaxy s3
carries the standard features of the
earlier jellybean stock camera app but
with several great additions from
Samsung such as burst shot best photo
share shot voice-activated shutter and
image stabilization for videos both
phones run jellybean the galaxy s3 came
out initially with Android 4.0 Ice Cream
Sandwich
but recently received official upgrades
to Android 4.1 jelly bean an earlier
version the Nexus 4 has the most recent
version 4.2.1 and being a Google
Experience device the Nexus 4 will be
one of the first to receive the newest
and latest Android version when it comes
the Nexus 4 runs pure Google Android so
it's an embellished experience of
Android as Google intended the galaxy s3
meanwhile is still Android to the core
with Samsung's TouchWiz nature UX
gracing its user interface
needless to say Samsung's TouchWiz is
one of the most feature-rich most
user-friendly and prettiest mobile user
interfaces powering all those features
on the galaxy s3 is a 2100 mAh lithium
ion battery with the published talktime
of 12 hours on 3G on the nexus 4 is a
2100 mAh lithium polymer battery said to
provide up to 15 hours of talktime on 3G
and theory these batteries supply enough
power to last beyond usual working hours
but then again these are estimates and
the battery life on your phone will
depend on your actual usage pattern
there's more to the Nexus 4 and the
galaxy s3 then I can justifiably cover
in this very brief comparison I've
discussed most of their major highlights
and I hope you'll be able to make up
your mind
get off that fence and decide which one
of these two you're going to spend your
hard-earned cash on what is it going to
be for you Google Nexus 4 or Samsung
Galaxy s3 leave a comment and let us
