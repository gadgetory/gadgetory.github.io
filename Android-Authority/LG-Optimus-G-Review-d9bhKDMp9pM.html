authority here I have the lg optimus G a
very attractive looking and super smooth
phone with exceptional display join me
as I take a tour around LG's newest
phone the Optimus G first let's take a
look at the phone's exterior the lg
optimus G actually looks very pretty it
has a black and white theme the front is
glossy jet-black and the back is white
it's a very classy color combination the
phone housing is made of plastic up
front you'll see all black
the only interruptions here are the LG
logo here speaker grille above the logo
and the 1.3 megapixel front camera near
the right corner the LED notification
light is somewhere here at the right
corner but you'll see it only when it
lights up the capacitive buttons are not
extented they're actually here at the
bottom of the screen you'll see them
only when the screen is on here's
another nice thing about the Optimus G
there's the metallic lining running
around the edges it adds to the phone's
classy appearance even the hardware
buttons have such metallic edging for
instance the power button here on the
right side of the phone has it on the
left side here is the volume rocker also
with metallic edging the SIM tray is
also here notice the very small hole
this one's very ejected the SIM tray the
phone allows only micro Sims so if you
have a regular sim you'll need to trim
it to micro size at the top edge here's
the headphone jack you can plug in the
quad beat headphones in here here's the
retractable TV antenna this unit has a
TV antenna because this test unit is for
the Korean market though I heard that
the international variant of the Optimus
G won't be having any TV antenna at all
I wouldn't want this antenna on the
international variant because it makes
the Optimus G look like a glamorous
walkie-talkie at the bottom is the
microUSB slot for charging and data
connection these two shiny things here
are Torx screw I suspect that if you
unscrew these you can actually open the
backplate I haven't tried
opening it though let's see the back
side as you can see the back is mostly
white according to sources units with
black or blue back covers are also
available this one is the 13 megapixel
back camera with a LED flash below it
it's also surrounded by metallic edging
just like the volume and power buttons
it's a high resolution camera capable of
capturing more details this protrudes
from the back actually if you look at it
from the side like this there's another
variant with an 8 megapixel camera and
it's also reportedly slimmer than this
one here's a loudspeaker grill at the
bottom this one is capable only of mono
output the audio quality is acceptable
for phone calls but a little
disappointing if you want to listen to
audio through this loudspeaker if you
want better audio listen to it using the
quad beat headphones plugged into the
audio jack here the back has diamond
patterns that look like crystals or
prisms card onto the back you won't be
able to feel the diamond texture because
it is covered with clear glass there's a
very slim gap that the edges of the
glass cover it's not melded seamlessly
to the rest of the backplate so if
you're not careful dust and grime could
enter through this gap now let's check
out the screen and display on the lg
optimus G the LCD screen has a 4.7 inch
diagonal and uses true HD IPS plus
technology with a resolution of 1280 by
768 at 15 to 9 aspect ratio the large
screen is great for multimedia viewing
web browsing and reading the display is
very sharp very crisp very clear and
less saturated the colors appear
realistic even under direct sunlight the
display is still visible especially with
brightness levels set to maximum LG says
that the screen technology used in this
phone reflects less light resulting in
display clearer than usual LCD screens
several of my colleagues here at Android
Authority actually like the display on
this phone the touch screen is very
snappy and very responsive take a look
sample add the bubble PV effect on the
lockscreen this is actually one of the
things we liked about this phone tap
hold and drag the bubble to expand it
and see a preview of the homescreen
underneath the display is great with HD
games there's hardly any lag the display
is very smooth and buttery it's still
very vibrant and crisp part of the
smoothness on this phone comes from its
processing hardware 1.5 gigahertz
quad-core Snapdragon s4 chipset and 2
gigabytes of RAM this phone also comes
with 32 gigabytes of internal storage
but no microSD expansion slot according
to sources some variant though will have
micro SD slots this phone comes with a
2100 mAh lithium polymer battery which
LG claims to have up to about 800
charging cycles in our testing the
battery lasted 4 hours under heavy HD
gaming heavy browsing Mac screen
brightness GPS Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
turned on with light to moderate use
though this battery can give you about
15 hours of talktime as I've already
mentioned the Optimus G comes with a 1.3
megapixel front camera in a 13 megapixel
back camera photos taken with a back
camera both outdoor and indoor shots
capture vibrant colors
the camera app has several features to
make photo and video capture easily the
phone has a built-in image stabilization
or anti shape feature known as smart
shutter the time-machine camera feature
captures images ahead before you even
press a shutter button this way you can
roll back to an earlier frame if the
actual shot is ugly the film has a
voice-activated shutter feature known as
boy shutter just say words like cheese
smile whiskey or even LG to snap your
picture without tapping the camera
button video recording is average on
this phone video captured outdoors get
vibrant colors but indoors it produces
dark noisy Club Center typical indoor
lighting sound recording though was very
sharp
as you've seen thus far the phone is
very smooth and buttery these are two
descriptions commonly associated with
Android 4.1 jelly bean but when you
checked the lg optimus G has Android 4.0
point four Ice Cream Sandwich I'll be
expecting more great things from this
phone when jelly bean arrives for it
word on the street says that LG will be
pushing jelly bean for the Optimus tree
sometime this December let's now take a
quick look at the software highlights on
this phone first let's look at the
multitasking function known as qslide
this feature lets you run one app on top
of another
let's try launching the stop browser app
and let's watch video voila this is not
split screen one app is actually
overlaid on the other app you can adjust
the transparency of the top app so you
can see what's underneath it like this
the phone also has a note-taking feature
called queue memo easily accessible from
the notification bar it lets you
scribble a note with your fingertip over
your current tasks for example you can
jot down a note while you're browsing
let's try this open the browser app then
access kmmo from the notification bar
like this write down a note and press
the overlay icon to keep the note on top
while you continue to use the film
there's another feature called
application link that can get you
started quickly with your day's tasks
upon waking up as soon as you turn off
the alarm clock application link
launches apps like email weather or
calendar so you can immediately see the
n-f-l that you need upon waking up the
film has two wise features two wise
ringtone for example a just spring tone
volume depending on the background noise
y screen on the other hand keeps the
phone screen turned on if it detects
your face looking at the screen you can
also personalize your app icons you can
use icons from icon sets or you can use
a
custom photo from your gallery for
example let's change this apps icon with
our photo of beg droid long press on
this app icon here then replace it with
our dear bug droids photo there so guys
this is the lg optimus G it's an elegant
phone with its sleek jet-black front
beautiful reflective bag and Mal edging
it feels good in the hand not too heavy
but not too light it's a very responsive
device with powerful hardware and
gorgeous display colors come out less
saturated and more realistic on photos
and videos it's bad camera though still
leaves much to be desired
the qslide feature is a convenient
addition making multitasking easier the
devices speakers are great with Dolby
mobile sound future but you have to plug
in your headphones to enjoy it the
Optimus G is undoubtedly one of the best
phones LG has created so far although it
might not prove heavy competition to its
peers being the first of its kind in
terms of hardware raises the bar for
future LG phones what do you think of
LG's latest Android phone guys like it
