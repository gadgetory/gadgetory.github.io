authority we here at armed tech on 2015
in Santa Clara and I've come to the
Odroid booth hello sir hello good to see
you you too
as you know I've reviewed some of your
boards on the site before just give me a
quick overview of what you've what
Odroid provide all right all right here
we have a no droid c1 plus this has the
heatsink removed so you can see the
processor and the RAM chips of course
it's a quad-core 1.5 gigahertz full HDMI
a lot of other inputs and outputs the
standard 40 pin header 4 USB ports and
Gigabit Ethernet Gigabit excellent yes
on its own chip so it's not running off
the same bus as the USB ports for
instance and then of course there I
squared us header you can hear that
playing on that system back there for
hi-def and then here we have the Odroid
xu4 which is an octa-core it didn't take
the process part of the fan off of this
one but we've got two USB 3.0 ports a
USB 2.0 port again Gigabit Ethernet
full-sized HDMI micro SD and emmc all
hard kernel boards have MMC chips which
are faster more reliable and I squared s
again and input/output pins now the XT 4
has a shifter shield board that's
available that will give you the same 40
pin yeah connector so that's that's nice
because you can actually prototype on it
and he picked up some displays and other
rights to them so this this is a 7 inch
touchscreen display that will be
available shortly c1 is attached to the
back of it so you can make your own
tablet here and great for running
Android and that's connected right now
to this standalone weather station also
made by heart colonel that has a battery
this arduino-compatible platform with
the screen on it and then
seven different sensors well technically
two chips running seven sensors that
detect the environment incident like a
light temperature humidity altitude that
type of thing you mentioned Android they
do this they run a variety of operating
systems tell me a bit about that right
yeah all of the Odroid boards as you
might tell from the second part of the
name droid yes runs Android and the they
also run ubuntu debian arch fedora other
variants of linux standard distributions
are a boon to you and android yeah Exton
those are the ones that come from the
company and here we've got xt force
inside of these they're called cloud
shells on the front we have a display
that'll show status but these are both
running internal hard drives running
through SATA connected to the state of
the USB 3.0 ports and XE 4s are inside
of these boxes so these are standalone
you know pretty good powered servers
right here you run them as a media box a
media center or whatever you want really
and if someone wanted to buy some of
these bowls where would they go in the
US the best place to go is a Mara droid
comm Amer IDR OID calm and fast shipping
inexpensive and almost every products in
stock all the time and internationally
internationally you can go to hard
colonel calm or pollen pol li n de in
Germany Lilliput in the UK and there's
also distributors in Poland and Russia
and a few other countries I thank you
very much for time today thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
