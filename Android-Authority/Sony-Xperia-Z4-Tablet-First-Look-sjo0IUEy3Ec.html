thoria what's going on everybody and
we're taking a look at the Sony Xperia Z
for its habit this is the updated
version of the great 10-inch tablets
that we have seen from Sony and you can
already see on the screen there we have
a very nice construction that now comes
in a 2k display that's of course 2560 by
1600 in the display this time around as
far as dimensions go that is always
going to be a marquee feature of these
particular devices
what we have is 6.1 millimeters in the
thickness for the Xperia z4 tablet which
is always really great you'll be able to
grip this device quite easily in the
hands and with that very slim profile
it's a very good looker as well we have
the white edition right here but of
course it's in the z4 tablet as it
wasn't a z3 tablet and z2 before it we
now have a soft touch backing it's a
very nice feel and you aren't able to
really get a nice grip on there even if
you're holding it in one hand the bezels
on the sides really make it quite easy
for you to put your thumb anywhere that
you need in order to get a nice grip
with the specs that are underneath we
have now the Snapdragon 810 to be able
to provide the kind of power that this
new version of the Xperia U I will have
which is of course lollipop and if you
bring down the notification drop-down
you'll see that that is a lollipop
enhancement already with the quick
setting shade that is right there and of
course the recent apps screen that now
has a card layout but the Xperia U I
always does have its own few additions
and that is found down here with the
small apps and you'll be able to have a
small window to take advantage of all of
the real estate in order to easily if I
could just move it over in order to
easily just have some very small
multitasking done on the screen and
Xperia UI other specifications include a
front-facing 5.1 megapixel camera so you
will be able to get some pretty good so
portrait for this particular camera I'll
go ahead and just jump in there right
now and right now I have the rear-facing
camera let's go ahead and just pop that
right over and you have the front-facing
camera that's able to get a pretty wide
angle shot so you'll get some pretty
good sub portraits with even this tablet
even if normally you aren't the kind of
person to use tablets for a kit for
their camera capabilities bring it
around to the back however and it is a 8
megapixel camera up on the back which
you can see right here on the top corner
there's no flash on here which is
usually the case for the Xperia tablet
but eight megapixel should be able to
get you some pretty decent looking shots
so if you are using your tablet for a
little while and you realize I'm gonna
get a good shot of something you'll be
able to do so with that and as there's
always a trope when it comes to the Sony
devices this is a waterproof and dust
resistance we're looking at IP 65 and 68
certifications here so you will get some
longevity out of this device the
durability that's needed and even the
usage in particular situations where
maybe some water or some spillage might
be involved but you still will be able
to have a great time on this tablet even
if an accident does happen but
nonetheless this is a look at the Sony
Xperia z4 tablet it's a wonderful
offering from Sony that brings updated
an updated look that really has an even
thinner profile despite having a lot of
the elements that we have already seen
in previous experiences but if you
already like the design from there and
we certainly did ourselves and you're
going to have a great time with this
particular tablet already and what the
power underneath with the 2k display
you'll have a lot of fun whether it's
with work or play and you'll have the
power underneath to be able to go as far
as you need to go so keep it tuned to
Android Authority for even more coverage
from Sony we're hanging out with Sony
you're taking a look at the offerings
that have here at MWC 2015 in Barcelona
Spain stay tuned for even more because
