brought to you by magnetic balls puzzle

I'm Joe Hindy the android authority app
guy and welcome back to android apps

some moves to talk about so let's get
started google has released arc welder
for Chrome browser and Chrome OS this
last week the extension allows you to
run a limited number of Android apps
straight from the browser which can be
fun or even useful for some people it's
not perfect but it's getting there as
part of the April Fool's Day festivities
Google turned google maps into a pacman
game it was a fun and goofy little thing
to experience you just have to make sure
that the place you're trying to play in
has enough roads or it won't let you
play developer handy games are
celebrating their 15-year anniversary
this week by putting all of their titles
on sale for fifteen cents you can follow
the link in the video description below
to see the list in its entirety most of
them are fairly well regarded in fifteen
cents is a steal for pretty much any
paid game whatsapp announced a calling
feature a while back that was invite
only now there are reports that whatsapp
calling is rolling out to all users even
without invites if you don't have it yet
patience because it is coming soon last
up this week a new gmail update has
included support for a unified inbox

autocomplete for keyword searching
larger attachment previews and bug fixes

latest in android apps news ok folks
let's take a look at the applications
that made a big splash this week
goodreads is a sort of social network
for readers helps you find new books and
novels to read based on reviews left by
friends the app receive a huge update
this last week that includes a
significant redesign most of the rest of
the improvements are based around the
redesign including easier to find
features and a new want to read button
to help you save stuff faster if you
like to read books you should definitely
try this out izanagi online is a new
MMORPG designed by the same guy who did
Afro Samurai the game features over 100
quests for classes and there's even a
storyline that you can play through the
graphics aren't half bad but there are
some early release day bugs and issues
that you may want to wait a couple of
weeks to get ironed out
marvel mighty heroes is a new online
hack and slash gamer you can play as
your favorite Marvel characters online
with up to four other real people it's a
fun little time waster but like any new
release there are some issues here and
there so do proceed with caution riff is
a new video sharing application by
Facebook that allows you to make videos
with friends here's how it works you
post a video to the service and then
your friends can add to it from there
the friends of your friends can then add
to it as well it's definitely something
unique and interesting and worth trying
out if you're into this kind of thing
the original tomb raider has been
released to android by Square Enix the
game has been lightly retouched for HD
screens but otherwise contains pretty
much all of the puzzles and content of
the original some have lamented the
controls and there are some bugs here
and there but it's only 99 cents which
is really cheap for a square enix game

quick moment to talk about our sponsors
