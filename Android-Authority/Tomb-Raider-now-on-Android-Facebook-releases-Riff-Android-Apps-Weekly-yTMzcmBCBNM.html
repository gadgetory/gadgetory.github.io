try this out izanagi online is a new
MMORPG designed by the same guy who did

that you may want to wait a couple of
weeks to get ironed out
marvel mighty heroes is a new online
hack and slash gamer you can play as
your favorite Marvel characters online

fun little time waster but like any new
release there are some issues here and
there so do proceed with caution riff is
a new video sharing application by
Facebook that allows you to make videos
with friends here's how it works you
post a video to the service and then
your friends can add to it from there

unique and interesting and worth trying

released to android by Square Enix the
game has been lightly retouched for HD
screens but otherwise contains pretty
