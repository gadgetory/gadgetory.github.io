first impressions of the Sony Xperia z2
you'll see that in the box there was a
really nice addition or two but the one
that I'm talking about right now are
these headphones that are just sitting
around my neck now these are the sony
MDR NC 31 am and to be quite honest what
i expected from them was good audio
quality but i didn't necessarily expect
what I got we do know that the Sony
Xperia z2 comes with noise canceling
technology inside of the unit itself but
it requires these headphones in order
for them to work so let's talk about
them for a little bit so after
unpackaging all of the contents in the
Sony Xperia z2 box what you're going to
find are these headphones just in case
in a very simple piece of plastic and
once you take them out of the plastic
when you look at them the shape of the
actual units for the earbuds do tell you
that you're probably going to get some
better quality from these compared to a
lot of other offerings that are found
with smartphones the other thing you
might notice is in the pin there are
five pins in the actual connector for
the earbuds that go into the phone
itself normally you see something like
three pins for a type of headphone that
might have a microphone in it or
controls for music playing or both but
in this case we have even more pins on
here and it will register when you enter
when you insert this into the phone
after that you will also find that the
cord is not all that long but the reason
for that is because the right earbud
goes around your neck because the cord
is longer than the one that is found on
the left side alright so let's go ahead
and take a look at what happens when I
connect these headphones to the Sony
Xperia z2 now what you're going to see
is a prompt that comes up when I insert
the connector first thing that comes up
is an icon for the noise canceling
technology and then after that we have
headset connected send it over to the
sound settings and take a look at what
is available there so here's the audio
accessories prompt like I showed you
already but also here we are with the
sound effects and if I click on here it
will give us a couple of options not
just for the actual enhancement of the
sound which has always been a part of
Sony Xperia phones but also the No
counseling which is right here it is on
on or auto and of course it detects that
this is a noise-canceling headset so
there you go and then the last thing
that you have here which I'll go into in
a bit is clear audio now when you're
using headphones clear audio tends to
narrow the soundstage a little bit and
that's not a bad thing by any means what
that actually does is it allows for a
little bit more clarity in at least the
highs and a bit of more power in the
lows the mids stay about the same but
with clear audio on you are able to get
a somewhat richer sound more clarity I
should say rather than richer because
when you have it off the soundstage
becomes wider and has a little bit more
of a wider feel I wish that I could
really show you just exactly how good
the sound is coming from these earphones
not just on their own but with the noise
canceling technology on with the birds
chirping out here with cars constantly
going by and people talking across the
street I did find a difference in the
sound when I have them on without the
noise canceling and then a lot of that
was just drowned out once I had the
noise canceling on the units or the
technology that is found in the Sony
Xperia z2 does its job very well and I
wanted to present to you the justjust
the way that it kind of changes the
experience of the media consumption that
you can have with this phone the Sony
Xperia z2 is one of the best phones out
this year really all of them are really
great but the Sony Xperia z2 has its
niche and in a way it has recaptured
that old Walkman experience that I used
to love having so in that regard the
headphones that are included with the
Sony Xperia z2 not only are they a high
quality offering that helps to justify
the higher cost of the entire package
but with the noise cancelling in here
you'll be able to have a lot of fun with
your music and all media using these
headphone so as a final note I did want
to revisit my comments regarding the
front-facing speakers on the Sony Xperia
z2 now they are stereo there or there's
one on the bottom one on the top and
regarding my comments I wanted to
revisit them and sort of clarify my
position did I seem a little bit harsh
in talking about the speakers I probably
did did I give you enough info as to why
probably not so here it is it pretty
much comes down to this
the fact that there are two speakers
front-facing on the Sony Xperia z2 is a
huge selling point for the phone why
because they are far and beyond better
than any single and rear-facing speakers
that are found on pretty much any other
phone out there today and that makes the
Sony Xperia z2 already leaps and bounds
better in terms of the media experience
but this is how I viewed it I used those
speakers primarily for gaming as I use
the headphones for music and what I
found was that while with another phone
which fine I'll go ahead and say it the
HTC One m8 while there is a very
immersive experience with the stereo
sound coming from those large boom sound
speakers unfortunately the nature of the
Sony Xperia line just means that with
the water and dust proofing the top and
bottom speakers for the z2 have to be
slits for the most part they're not
going to be big units and with that in
mind what you essentially get here is a
sound experience from this from the Sony
Xperia z1 times 2 and now facing forward
now those are two big enhancements to
the sound quality and the z2 deserves a
lot of credit for having that however
when you think of it that way sure they
face forward sure they do get pretty
loud because now they're working in
tandem but at the same time the sound is
just not as rich as I was expecting if
my expectations were too high then I
will apologize for that coming out but
at the same time I did want these
speakers to blow me away and they simply
did not I do have a lot of fun with them
I do feel that the sound on this is
better than pretty much any other phone
save for maybe one or two out there and
you know which ones I'm talking about
but at the same time I do have to say
they are a great selling point of this
phone so I apologize for being a little
bit too harsh on these speakers but now
you know exactly why I thought so now X
loud does boost the loudness of the
sound itself but it also kind of does so
detracting from the actual clarity and
richness of the sound itself the clarity
of the sound is under clear phase aptly
named primarily because it does the same
thing with the headphones like in clear
stereo where it narrows the soundstage s
force front surround wasn't necessarily
one that I found very enjoyable really
because it just widened the soundstage
to really try to get that
surround sound and just sort of fell
artificial so it's not one I use very
often most of the time I've just turned
on clear Audio plus and just leave it on
and from there I just use the speakers
the way that they are
and so there you have it for this
feature focus regarding the sound
experience on the Sony Xperia z2 I did
want to revisit all of this for two
particular reasons the first reason
being because I wanted to show you how
Sony has sort of taken back that Walkman
mentality that Walkman feel with these
great headphone offerings that you can
use because the z2 has noise canceling
built in and in a way this is a review
of the actual headphones themselves so
it's something that I wanted to sort of
give its own due process but also I
wanted to revisit my stance on the
front-facing speakers now let me just
say one more time the front-facing
speakers are a great addition to the z2
and are a big selling point for it but
for me it just reminded me of a pretty
decent speaker that would be found on
the rear of many of phones that are
found in the market today times two and
then put on to the front now while those
are great enhancements for a speaker
sound in and of itself I didn't find
this experience to be incredible to the
point that I would say it's better than
any other phone out there it's better
than a lot of them though so keep it
