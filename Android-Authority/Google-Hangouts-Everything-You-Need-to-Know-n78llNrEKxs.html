handy the Android authority app guy
happy Google i/o everyone after the
intro we'll take a much closer look at
Google touch replacement called Google
Hangouts so does everyone remember when
we all thought this was going to be
called babble toes for good times when
you first open hangouts you'll be
greeted with a fresh new interface it
opens to your current conversations then
you can slide to the right to start a
new hangout which is the new lingo for
starting a new conversation when you
slide to the right you can see your most
frequently contacted acquaintances and
below that is everyone else in your
circles if you're like me and have a lot
of people circled this list can get
pretty gigantic you can tell if a
contact is online if their profile
picture is slightly faded or fully clear
slightly faded means unavailable while
fully clear means the equivalent of the
green dot in Google Talk once you open a
conversation you can slide back to the
left to get back to the active
conversation list you can click on the
plus sign the top to start a new hangout
to archived conversations simply slide
them off the screen these can be viewed
later in the archived hangouts section
next to the plus sign is the three menu
button click it to access things like
archived hangouts hangout invites from
other people and you can even set
notifications to news for a period of
time so you don't get notifications for
a while so if you were to say sleep set
it for eight hours and Google Hangouts
will not bother you until you wake up
there's really nothing all that special
about the settings menu essentially all
you can do there is change your
notification behaviors like ring tone
and vibrate controls you can manage your
blocked user lists from there and you
can also set custom invites for your
circles next we'll move on to
functionality when you get right down to
the meat and potatoes this functions
more or less like Google Talk do you can
add text conversations with people like
before or you can initiate video chats
the difference being that video chats
are now Google Hangouts like on Google
Plus instead of a video call on Google
Talk if you want some dessert with your
meat and potatoes google has included
some new functionality too you can now
have group chats during testing I was
able to chat with most of the Android
authority on air crew all in a single
thread this is way better than Google
Talk which didn't have this
functionality at all also it would be
downright irresponsible to not mention
the emojis there are hundreds of them
there are Smiley's and animals and dog
poo and Dragons and little pictures of
buildings so many
oh geez and definitely something to have
a lot of fun with in the Chrome
extension you can make unicorns dance
across the chat window
sadly dancing unicorns is not part of
the mobile app experience the last thing
we'd like to mention is the ability to
now send images directly over the app
this functionality wasn't really there
in Google Talk requiring people to post
pictures elsewhere and then paste links
now you can share right from your device
just click the camera button next to the
text entry box to do that overall the
new Google Hangouts app is a big
improvement over the old Google Talk
method unfortunately we've seen a few
launch problems my HTC one didn't get
switched from talk to hangouts for a
full day after I updated while my Nexus
4 updated right away there have been
some other temporary issues reported -
which is really dulled the excitement of
the release however once these issues
get ironed out there will no doubt be a
more positive outlook on Google Hangouts
the only potential issue is the SMS
support which is still a toss-up we
don't know yet if it'll get added but if
it does iMessage be damned because there
will be a new Universal message champion
if you want to get it just update your
Google Talk app to the new Google
Hangouts or just go get it from the
Google Play Store for those of you
updating from the old Google Talk it may
take a day or so for the new interface
to pop up so key word here ladies and
gentlemen is patience once again I'm Joe
