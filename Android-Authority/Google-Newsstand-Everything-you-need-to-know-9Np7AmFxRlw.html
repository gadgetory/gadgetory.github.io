handy the Android authority app guy
Google has combined Google Currents and
Google magazine into a single
application called Google newsstand and
in this video we're gonna see how that
turned out
so how does this app work the current
part of the app allows you to populate
your news with RSS feeds that interest
you while the magazine hath lets you
find and subscribe to your favorite
magazines the point is Google now gives
you the ability to consolidate your
entire news feed into a single interface
the interface itself is very fluid you
can swipe between the various functions
to get to what you want to get to you
can access feeds and magazines
individually or in the case of news
feeds one giant list of news the design
is lovely and moving around the app
takes but a moment to get used to and
that's really it folks if you've used
the Google current or a Google magazine
application or any other RSS application
for that matter you have a pretty good
idea of how this app actually works you
subscribe to feeds you get subscriptions
some magazines and you read or view it
people mourning the death of Google
Reader now have a second big option
aside from feedly the use of this app is
fairly obvious you subscribe to your
favorite feeds and magazines and then
read the content that gets released from
those feeds and magazines again easy
peasy
so here is the good the app is very
beautifully done swiping between the
various pages the simplicity of the look
and the little stuff added in like
animations make the app fun to use it
had every magazine and news feed that I
searched for including the obscure and
small sites that I subscribe to so users
will not be without options for content
to consume having the RSS feed in with
the magazines app encourages people to
check out the other side RSS readers
will likely check out magazines and vice
versa and here is the bat if all you
wanted was an RSS app or a magazine app
then you're obviously dealing with a lot
of clutter that you didn't want the good
news is a little configuration can all
but fix this you cannot manage your
magazine subscriptions from within the
application you'll be kicked out to the
browser to deal with them there it's not
necessarily a bad thing but it is a
little inconvenient
the only other small nitpick is loading
a feed for the first time when I
selected the Android Authority feed it
showed a single feed and no icon after
it loaded it had numerous feeds and an
icon so it does get fixed but it can
make feet look less valuable than they
actually are at first all in all this is
a mammoth improvement RSS and magazines
on Android
the most popular services and combining
them not only gives current users of
those services a chance to try something
new but adds value to entice newer users
there were a few problems here and there
but nothing bad enough to dissuade
people from trying it out so if you
haven't done so already you can find it
in the Google Play Store once again on
