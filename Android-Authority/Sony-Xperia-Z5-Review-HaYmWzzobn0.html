three new Xperia z5 phones are released
this year a compact version which is
more affordable smaller and made with
more plastic pieces a premium model
which is pretty pricey a little more
showy and pushes the envelope a little
but right in the middle we have the
standard Sony Xperia z5 hello everybody
I'm crystal and Gary Sims at a great
review on the Xperia z5 compact a couple
weeks ago so make sure you go check that
out too to see the differences between
these two devices but for now let's take
a closer look at the Sony Xperia z5 when
it comes to design Sony hasn't had any
drastic changes in their Xperia
but that might not be too much of a bad
thing for some people the z5 is very
square like the other Xperia films the
corners are ever so slightly rounded but
nowhere near as much as other phones I
always thought the LG g4 looked very
rectangular but it's nothing compared to
the z5 s design it's definitely not my
favorite smartphone when it comes to
design but I do think it has a sense of
luxury and elegant Ness to it more so
than other smartphones on the market
right now around the z5 we have a smooth
metal frame with frosted glass on the
back of the phone it looks really
beautiful and feels really good too but
the glass does make it a little slippery
especially since there's a frosted back
and that gives it more of a matte feel
to it it's not too thick although
thicker than the z3 Plus at 7.3
millimeters all around and it's pretty
light even though it may not look it at
154 grams
we have the sony logo and the Xperia
logo on the back along with an NFC icon
which is a little weird
although NFC is important is not like
some huge stand up feature or anything
but who cares I guess on the top left we
have our 23 megapixel camera with this
LED flash underneath the front of the
phone sports a 5.2 inch HD screen with
some decently sized bezels in the top
and the bottom and above it is a
front-facing camera and a little
notification light that by default is
white but you have the freedom to change
now if you look a little more closely at
the front of the z5 you'll notice these
front-facing stereo speakers on the top
and bottom
almost hidden to keep the front of the
phone looking very clean they sound good
too
they're not very loud however and they
are definitely better speakers on phones
but the front-facing speakers found here
on the z5 are better than any speaker
found on the bottom or back of any other
phone on the right side of the phone
were greeted with a lot of buttons that
experie users have been familiar with
the power button is on top and placed
almost near the middle and this year
Sony designed the power button to be
flush with this border so you have to
kind of push it into the phone to
activate it it does have a nice squishy
clique to it but it can be a little hard
to initiate that click with it being so
flush with a side the power button does
double this time though as a fingerprint
scanner it's a pretty small area for a
fingerprint scanner but it does a pretty
good job at reading your print it's
quite fast not the fastest but it gets
the job done and overall the reliability
is decent it depends what finger you're
using you'll probably end up registering
your left pointer finger or your right
thumb it may be a little awkward to use
the scanner with your left pointer
finger so it may have some trouble
scanning sometimes but your right thumb
should be very reliable below it is our
more conventional volume buttons they
feel very responsive and stick out like
we're used to with volume buttons on
phones the only thing that makes these
buttons a little unconventional is a
placement they are so low whether you're
using the phone in your right hand or
left hand it can be a little awkward to
press them and finally on the bottom we
have a dedicated camera button which
sticks out and has a lot of travel to it
it feels quite nice so when holding this
button the camera app will quickly
launch which is very convenient and once
in the app by clicking the button it
will snap a picture this button is
really only practical when taking
pictures in landscape as it feels almost
like you're snapping a picture with a
DSLR or something the bottom is home to
our micro USB charging port and what
looks like a keychain hook the left side
is where we can access our SIM card and
yes also our micro sd card the problem
is is really hard to access them first
you have to use your nail to undo the
flap and then continue using your nail
to pull out the thin plastic housing if
you're picking up this phone and are
constantly exchanging SD cards maybe
make sure you skip a finger one nail
filing one reason these may be so hard
to access is because they need to be
kept apart ected as this phone is IP 68
certified dust proof and water-resistant
Xperia z5 is sporting a 5.2 inch IPS
screen at a 1080 by 1920 resolution is a
pretty nice screen too and in terms of
colors is fantastic colors are very
vibrant and whites are very white maybe
leaning a little toys a warm side but
they still look very nice if you want a
more saturated image you can easily do
so within settings the screen gets
pretty bright too you may have trouble
seeing it in direct sunlight at times
but it can get brighter than a good
amount of phones out right now apart
from colors though the HD screen is not
quite as beautiful as a lot of other
1080 by 1920 phone displays it almost
appears to be a slight step back from
the z3 plus it seems like there's a very
slight haze over everything in a way
coming from the oneplus 2 that has an
even lower pixel density than the z5 the
z5 definitely is a weaker in terms of
screens when triggering fast animations
like the pulldown notification menu text
and icons seem to have a subtle ghost
effect to them
more so than other HD phones all that
being said the display is definitely not
bad and now performs a lot of displays
when it comes to color representation
but in the other areas it falls behind
Sony stuck with the Snapdragon 810
processor on the Xperia z5 along with
the three gigs of RAM with this phone
being 10 grams thicker than its
predecessor you would think Sony would
be able to put a bigger battery in the
z5 but it's actually 30 million powers
smaller than the z3 plus at 2900
milliamp hours really 30 milliamps isn't
much of a difference as we'll find out
later so does the a10 processor make the
phone hot well when I first got the
phone and installed on my 40 something
apps I use at once yeah it got hot but
from what I could tell just as hot as it
did on my LG g4 note 5 + 1 + 2 when
doing the same thing in normal u so I
never noticed a phone getting the
slightest bit hot but when doing more
CPU intensive stuff like gaming the z5
did get noticeably hot once again no
more than any other phone I've used
maybe technically it does overheat a bit
more than other processors but I wasn't
able to notice it by just feeling gary
sims tested this morn death in his z5
compact review on this channel and
pretty much for an app to stop working
due to overheating you have to really be
doing something crazy like shooting 4k
video for over 20 minutes the great
thing about Sony Xperia phones is their
software the Xperia z5 is run
Android lollipop 5.1.1 and it actually
looks close to stock Android there are a
lot of additions sony added to the
software however but not too much to
make stock Android designs
unrecognizable for example you can
change a clock style on the lockscreen
to some different options and you can
rearrange your icons or even hide some
in the notification pulldown and the
freedom to decide which icons are shown
on the status bar is also present with
the z5 software so you can hide the
battery percentage or time kind of like
what you're capable of doing with
Android marshmallow themes are also
available that include live wallpapers
that move depending on where you touch
my favorite is the Xperia theme that
will slowly change color depending on
how often you use a phone the important
thing is everything runs very smoothly
when you first turn on the phone after
powering off there will be a bit of a
lag for a couple of minutes but after
that you shouldn't notice any stutters
or crashes by default the app opening
and closing animations are bumped up to
make the overall experience feel very
snappy Sony gave the newest Xperia a
bump up camera sensor from twenty point
seven megapixels to twenty-three
megapixels along with that we have our
autofocus LED flash and although there's
no optical image civilization
unfortunately the software video
stabilization does a pretty nice job as
you'll soon see so I was pretty excited
to test out this camera because some of
the best smartphone camera sensors are
supplied by Sony and all of our Sony's
website they boasts about the picture
quality this thing can take they even
fought the megapixel count on the back
of the phone unfortunately the camera is
not as great as you would think and on
top of that the whole megapixel count is
very misleading I'll have to address
first that even though Sony is boasting
that the Xperia z5 is a 23 megapixel
camera really that should mean 8
megapixels sure the z5 is capable of
shooting in 23 megapixels but for
whatever reason the camera software is
not optimized for it so when comparing a
23 megapixel shot to an 8 megapixel shot
the 8 megapixel shot will often times
look undoubtedly better better colors
better dynamic range and better looking
textures sony seems to notice as well as
a megapixels is enabled by default but
there are times where 23 megapixels look
better so just makes things a little
confusing if you don't want to have to
mess around with these settings just
stick to 8 these next pictures were
taken with 8 megapixel
so in normal lighting conditions
pictures are actually very nice there's
a lot of detail in these pictures and
colors look very good they have a nice
saturated look to them there's a little
sharpening going on but most of the time
at least a better picture dynamic range
looks very good sometimes they can over
expose a little but nothing too unusual
here's a situation where I think 23
megapixels actually makes a better
looking picture when you're standing
really far away from a very complicated
looking focus point the 8 megapixel
software enhancements seem to be a
little too much over sharpening
everything so using the unoptimized 23
megapixels actually ends up looking
better than the optimized 8 see what I
mean this just gets confusing anyway
medium light pictures is where the
quality will begin to take a dip they
still look very nice but you'll start to
see some purple creeping into the darker
areas of the photos and then when you
get into low-light pictures forget about
it the purple has attacked anything that
is dark looking will have this purple
hue to it the same can be said for the
front-facing 5.1 megapixel camera and
good light pictures look very good nice
details and it exposes perfectly in
medium light selfies are still great
even in low-light selfies look pretty
good details are lost and photos can be
a bit grainy but the colors are better
than the rear facing and low-light it
seems to get that purple human selfies
you have to go to extreme low-light
video looks very good on the z5
everything seems exposed correctly and
even though there's no optical image
stabilization the software makes up for
it and creates a pretty smooth image I
was pleasantly surprised like I said
before 4k is available too although when
shooting for long periods of times the
phone may overheat there's also tons of
camera features and effects like a our
FX multi camera face and picture and
more like I said the battery is ever so
slightly smaller at 2900 milliamp hours
but it doesn't seem to affect the
battery life the dzifa should last you
an entire day especially if you use the
many battery saving modes that the sony
pact to the software like stamina mode
and ultra stamina mode without using any
battery saving modes I was able to get
at least four and a half to five hours
of screen on time with the Xperia z5 and
that's what spending lots of time
browsing the web sending lots of text
and taking some pictures throughout the
day it's a very reliable battery and
with
charge 2.0 you can charge very fast so
is the Sony Xperia z5 worth picking up
over his predecessor the z3 Plus well
there's not really much new here there's
a fingerprint scanner that works very
well there's a new and bigger camera
sensor but it doesn't really make much
of a difference the internals are pretty
identical I don't think it's worth
upgrading if you already own the z3 plus
if having a fantastic camera isn't too
much of a concern for you and you're
looking for a reliable elegant looking
phone with enhanced stock Android
software the Sony Xperia z5 could be a
good choice if you don't - price tag of
course well thanks for watching my
