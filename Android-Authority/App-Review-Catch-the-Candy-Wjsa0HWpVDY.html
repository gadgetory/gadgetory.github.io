from android authority calm and today
we'll be talking about catch the candy
it's available in the Google Play Store
for 99 cents the game starts out with an
easy to navigate menu on the bottom
right is general settings next to it is
sharing via Facebook and Twitter on the
bottom left is the achievements and
score menu and to the left of that to
help menu when you're ready to play
click play and then choose your scenario
people familiar with Angry Bird should
recognize the level selection set up
immediately you unlock new scenarios as
you complete earlier ones once you've
selected a level it's time to play the
controls and catch the candy you're
pretty simple you click on the screen to
shoot your arm out and use it to
maneuver around obstacles to get the
candy since the arm can hit and stick to
nearly anything you usually have free
rein to move around as you please
controlling the game isn't difficult but
the various obstacles can be pretty
challenging there are no move limits so
you can play around in each level until
you get the candy the more moves you use
the lower score you get so you'll want
to try to complete it in as few moves as
possible overall the gameplay is very
simple and interesting since you do have
free rein and infinite moves each level
can be completed without a great deal of
difficulty but getting three stars is
always the real goal here all things
considered we gave gameplay a value of
3.5 out of 5 the graphics can catch the
candy are colorful and playful when
you're playing you get the feeling that
you're goofing around and having some
fun and the graphics do a lot to
reinforce that feeling that said
everything in the game is crisp clear
and well-defined the obstacles level
design and even character design fit
together very well and it looks coherent
and well thought out for playing as a
little furball with a freakishly long
arm the game looks complete and
professional no amateur work here so we
gave graphics a 4 out of 5 stars earlier
we made the comparison of this game too
angry birds and we're going to do it
again this games replay value is based
on replaying levels to get the full 3
star rating you can progress through the
game just by completing the level but
half the fun is figuring out how to do
it without losing any stars given that
there are a lot of levels to start with
there are a bunch of opportunities to
replay levels to get a better score
herocraft will also be adding more
levels in the future so new content
helps out a lot to the bottom line is
that this definitely borrows from games
like Angry Birds in terms of level set
up and execution since people enjoy
playing those games over and over again
there's a decent chance that this game
will have that same quality so we gave
replay value a 3.5 out of 5 stars when
you get right down to it
game is fun if you need something to do
for a few minutes but we can't see this
becoming a staple in anyone's gaming
repertoire in other words if you're
someone who likes to keep a few simple
games on your android phone to kill a
few minutes or entertain your kids this
game is perfect if you're a serious
gamer who needs more out of their games
and simple puzzles you may not like this
game as much that said for just a buck
this game really is a good deal for
anyone there's a lot of content it is
pretty interesting and fun and there is
definitely going to be more content at
it eventually if the game starts getting
too hard there's a menu button will take
you to a YouTube video showing you how
to complete any given level which is
actually a pretty cool little feature
it's simplistic gameplay and familiar
level set up keeps it from being a truly
brilliant game but nevertheless we gave
it a 3.5 out of 5 star rating overall
