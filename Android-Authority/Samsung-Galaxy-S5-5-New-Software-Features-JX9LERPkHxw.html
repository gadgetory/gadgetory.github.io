release there are quite a few new
features introduced in each new
iteration so depending on who you are
you may or may not find these useful but
let's take a look at some of the ones
found in the Samsung Galaxy s5 hey it's
Josh regard from Android 30 what's going
on everybody and this is a feature
focused look at five new features found
in the updated version of TouchWiz in
the Samsung Galaxy s5 alright and here
we are taking a look at some new
features in the software of the Samsung
Galaxy s5 in this future focus however
before I get to the shortlist that I
have of the new software additions I did
want to show you some new enhancements
to the overall experience that more or
less may have been there before but now
I've been given a bit of a different
look or some different functionality the
first one is in the lock screen now this
lock screen is already pretty nice with
all of the bright colors and whatnot on
this camera button down here that you
slide up in order to go straight to the
camera but this widget up here is
dynamic in that it will show something
different depending on what application
is playing in the background and in this
case I have the watch on or the smart
remote app depending on what model you
have displaying some buttons that I can
use to control my TV now from the lock
screen it is really nice to be able to
do this and in my case I have my TV
already playing some JK news so you'll
hear it in the background as I turn the
volume up and from there we'll move
right along into the first item on my
list of new software additions than my
magazine now you can see here in the
video already that well I was a little
bit disappointed with the my magazine
offering primarily because even if it
piggy backs off of Flipboard and
actually doesn't do so to the extent
that I would like you can see that it's
a curated list of categories there and
primarily the subscriptions that you
have in Flipboard already set up it
won't really filter through here as you
have to pick from this particular list
now that's a bit of a bummer but my
magazine does help you get your social
media feeds to the my magazine
application itself so it does allow you
to sort of see a quick glance at what
your friends are up to if that's your
thing but when it comes to the news it
might be a bit of a hodgepodge of
different outlets and different sources
that won't really allow you to delve
into what you really want to see that
said though Flipboard is still a very
powerful news aggregating application
unfortunately when it comes to the my
magazine it uses Flipboard to sort of to
sort of show you a very particular list
of things and ultimately when you click
on an item you might be going into an
area of Flipboard that you pretty much
don't really use anyway the next piece
of software on our list is one that
technically was there already but has
been given new life primarily because of
a new button layout in the past you had
to hold to the home button in order to
get to the recent apps screen but now we
have a recent apps button as menu is not
quite as needed especially in these new
versions of Android so if we hit the
recent apps button we go straight to the
recent apps screen and we have a few
options at our disposal not only do we
have the list of applications that are
right here that are shown in a pretty
samsung quintessential way we also have
a couple of options down here for
clearing the entire list or going into a
task manager which is actually quite
nice because it shows you how much
memory is being used up at once so if we
head back to the recent apps screen it
is a nice way of getting between all of
your applications nicely much more like
a stock like experience in which you
just have that for multitasking so if
you're not a big multi window user or
even let's say a couple of other
multitasking abilities that are in
TouchWiz and this is a little bit more
your style because it's something that
you're more used to well it's now
available to you instead of having to
wait for the recent apps screen by
holding down the home button and this is
definitely something that I enjoy doing
because I'm used to this form of
multitasking speaking of multitasking
there is one nice tool in the
notification drop-down that you'll find
called the toolbox now essentially
toolbox is just a chat head as you can
see me dragging it around here that
gives you access to up to five
applications that you can use for
shortcuts in an easy way that little
chat head as I keep calling it a little
toolbox as it is called will keep
floating around no matter what
application you're in except for places
like maybe games and the camera but it
is available for you to be able to jump
between applications quite easily it's
almost like a somewhat different way of
looking at your recent apps if you keep
using the same five applications over
and over again and you can see here that
in the settings you are able to
the five applications from the long list
that might be installed in your phone
now here's one that I really enjoyed and
it's called the download booster it
pretty much sets out to do what it says
and that is make your downloads even
faster for any files that are over 30
megabytes in this case I was doing three
hundred and sixty-five megabytes of a
download of plants vs. zombies - and the
download booster then uses Wi-Fi and
your high speed mobile data connection
in tandem in order to download it as
fast as possible let me tell you it
really works this particular install
happened and just this record amount of
time you can see in the notification
drop-down how fast you're going and
which connection is providing that speed
and ultimately it's a great way of just
downloading large large files from a
number of different applications
including the Play Store as you see here
with this game but also one thing you
have to remember is a fraction maybe
even half of this download was done
using my mobile data so I probably used
up quite a bit of it so don't get those
overage charges just be careful when
using the download booster and in the
final item on this list we take a look
at the ultra power saving mode now this
is a really nice feature that allows you
to stay connected even when you have a
little battery life left and by turning
off the mobile data when the screen is
off by making everything monochrome and
also by turning off other features such
as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth the s5 software
TouchWiz is trying to give you as much
as you need without really taking away
all of your connectivity and in this
case we're looking at the phone and
messages and even the internet browser
of course that will be in black and
whites unfortunately in the list of
applications that you can use it is a
very limited list but in a way it kind
of makes sense because all of this is in
the interest of saving as much battery
as possible but at the very least you
will still be able to receive calls you
will be able to send messages using the
messaging app and you can actually do
some web browsing if you really need it
to so it's just a mode that is available
for those of you who really need to get
the most out of your battery life and so
there you have it for this feature focus
look at some software additions put into
the new version of TouchWiz in the
Samsung Galaxy s5 some of the
enhancements that were put in like for
example the new power widget with all
the circles and also all the circles
that comprise the settings menu
we're already covered in the full review
so you can check it out on the full
review but in this feature focus I
wanted to give
a little bit more information on the
five that I felt were most significant
and actually outside of that list of
five there aren't too many other
enhancements and addition so you're
pretty much looking at what is new and
the software experience this time around
stick around and drop us some likes in
our videos because we love to see those
thumbs up and also subscribe to our

you're done with all of that head on
