large company like Samsung be targeted
by other companies when it comes to
their flagship smartphone devices trying
to dethrone the galaxy but this time
it's by a smaller company whose first
flagship device outing really tries to
take the crown of most affordable phone
for all the power that it provides hey
it's Josh McGann from Android thority
what's going on everybody and here's a
look at the 1+1 versus the Samsung
Galaxy s5 whereas we have a somewhat
fresh look at a flagship smartphone from
one plus the terms Samsung and galaxy
are so familiar that they tend to make
you think of specific design choices the
s5 essentially looks like its
predecessors putting rounded corners on
a plastic body and the same button
layout we've come to expect returns with
the tactile home button and the back and
now recent apps key is flanking it
buttons line the sides and the bottom
has a cover for the microUSB charging
slot which is a nuisance to use but does
help the phone's IP certification it's
on the back that we find a change as the
removable back houses the addition of a
heartrate monitor but is now made up of
a perforated or dimpled plastic this is
perhaps the most polarizing design
choice and to us it's not really a step
forward for Samsung's design language
overall oneplus look to create a phone
that was elegant but also kept it simple
you don't get many extra features like a
removable battery or expandable storage
like found in the removable backing of
the s5 the shell of the oneplus one is
removable and replaceable with different
materials soon to make it to the oneplus
store but nonetheless this large device
sporting a 5.5 inch screen a silver
lining around the front panel a
sandstone sandpaper-like material for
the back of this version of the phone
and a typical button layout size really
dictates much of this part of the battle
though the now larger bezel of the
galaxy s5 helps make it somewhat closer
to the size of the one the oneplus
behemoth is still a tougher device to
work with in one hand the 5.1 inch
screen of the galaxy s5 doesn't really
blow up the s5 too much compared to its
predecessors and as far as looks go it
depends on your tastes though we will
say that the s5 doesn't feel like too
much of a step forward in terms of its
aesthetics to its credit however the s5
will survive more due to its IP
certification
on the other hand anyone preferring
simplicity will find it with the 1+1
just in a pretty large package Samsung
Super AMOLED technology once again goes
up against the competition and in this
case it is the 5.5 inch LTPS performer
of the one the s5 has all the typical
benefits of this display tech providing
high contrast between the colors that
are all incredibly vivid to some perhaps
too vivid but that saturation can be
toned down if truly needed the larger
screen of the oneplus one is a great
color producer in its own right and
having more real estate can make media
even more fun to consume like with video
games or movies viewing webpages or
reading text won't be an issue either
way with pixel densities of over 400 in
either device while size will be a big
factor in your choice here once again we
will admit that the high saturation and
contrast of the Super AMOLED screen does
make the viewing experience of the s5
really enjoyable and it's in performance
that we see a pretty even playing field
with both phones supporting the
Snapdragon 801 and the adrenal 330 with
two gigabytes of RAM there's no doubting
how great the performance packages are
and thus it is up to the optimizations
of the software to provide a great
experience oneplus gets the advantage
with Sandridge in mod the high powered
version that takes inspiration from
stock Android and is a snappy time all
around the galaxy s5 on the other hand
has TouchWiz which often gets a bad rap
for being too robust for its own good
and thus suffering from some lag
thankfully TouchWiz this time has been
getting it's improvements in recent
years and the s5 provides a pretty good
example of that lag is thankfully pretty
minimal with the only real instances
coming when the operating system has to
load multiple elements all together like
in the my magazine but ultimately there
is speed to be had in either device no
matter which flavor of Android you end
up choosing if there's one thing that
Samsung has always tried to do its pack
as much as possible into their
smartphones and that shows in the
hardware aspect the s5 comes with the
kind of tropes power users usually want
a removable battery expandable storage
all connectivity options including an IR
blaster and sensors for various gestures
you may or may not use but on top of all
of this are two main editions of the
heartrate monitor and the fingerprint
scanner embedded into the large home
button in my time with the s5 though I
found both of these features to not
really add that much value the HRM is
far from an ideal
tool for anyone truly into fitness
though it could come in handy maybe just
once in a while and the finger scanner
though it does add some extra security
to the phone is not an ideal tool for
anyone that prefers faster unlocking of
their phones the one on the other hand
provides the essentials and not too much
more the battery doesn't allow for the
removable battery or expandable storage
but it packs pretty much every core
connectivity tool where the one does
shine is in providing as much as it can
for an affordable price for a good price
you can get the version of the oneplus
one with 64 gigabytes of on-board
storage which should be plenty for all
but the most power hungry users battery
life on other device fared quite well
though the galaxy s5 does come with some
robust choices for power saving and by
making the right choices on the s5 you
could really make it go above and beyond
especially with the ability to replace
that battery if you need to a new 16
megapixel camera and the galaxy s5 looks
to improve the smartphone photography
game while the 13 megapixel shooter of
the oneplus one takes the conventional
camera experience but there's a lot of
features into it the galaxy s5 did away
with all the different modes you may or
may not have used from the s4 and put in
plenty of replacements most of which
proved kind of useful like the live HDR
and the selective focus modes and while
these modes might not always work
perfectly they certainly helped make
photos pop when they did throw under
that a ton of other options for catering
the shot to one's liking and we have a
pretty powerful ISO cell camera that
took some pretty great photos furthering
Samsung's prowess in this particular
aspect the oneplus one on the other hand
takes on the 13 megapixel optics package
but its software brings a lot to the
table swipe up and down on the interface
and you'll see all the different modes
and filters to really make the shot what
you want it to be there are quite a few
options underneath as well even the
ability to choose what video codec you
want to use for video capture the one
provided very clean shots providing a
great experience that it was at once
pretty easy to use and pretty powerful
and when it comes to choosing either
camera it really depends on what kind of
scene production you want Samsung often
puts quite a bit of saturation into the
photos their phones produce and the ISO
cell performer is no exception you don't
get quite as much saturation in the
colors of the oneplus one but its
sharpness level is still on par though
the 16 megapixels of the s5 might make
it the better choice for cropping down
image
and finally in software both Samsung and
oneplus took very different routes to
create their flavors of Android
we'll start with Samsung and it's a
long-running TouchWiz interface it's
gotten a bit of a makeover and does look
a bit cleaner and when it comes to
general functionality TouchWiz has
always been chock-full of different
features everything from navigation
gestures to the multi window to even a
toolbox for easily accessing a number of
used applications while those features
might be useful and pretty welcome
others aren't quite as much the my
magazine in particular is 2 curated and
doesn't provide enough freedom to cater
the newsfeed otherwise it's a pretty
familiar experience for any Android user
the recent apps button brings a familiar
multitasking experience and for all
TouchWiz provides that you may or may
not use it's not hard to get the common
and daily tasks done in no time one plus
on the other hand employed the help of
the powerful custom ROM team CyanogenMod
to bring an experience that's much like
the stock Android built put on steroids
on the surface it looks like Android
KitKat but go underneath the surface and
you'll find a lot of customization
options like in the theme showcase and
even options to tweak the button layouts
to your liking cyanogen flavor tools
like the gallery app and the features
that you can only get on a custom built
operating system like for example on
native screen recorder sweeten the pot
for many users custom roms bring
features that users could only wish the
simplistically elegant stock Android
interface had and in the oneplus one CM
has been given that spotlight so when it
comes to choosing which software is for
you that's all about choice Samsung
might have you with its flavor of
Android replete with multitasking tools
and a fingerprint scanner if that's
really what you need or the oneplus can
bring you a great-looking Android build
that if that is ultimately the look
you're going for can be catered exactly
to the way that you want it otherwise
though the galaxy s5 can easily be had
on contracts throughout every carrier
pretty much anywhere by now the oneplus
one is still a little tough for the
masses to get their hands on that being
said the power of the one does run a lot
cheaper unlocked at $2.99 for the base
model and 349 for the 64 gigabyte
version used in this comparison and so
there you have it two giants going at it
the giants that is Samsung the drying
company with a very colorful history of
successful smartphone releases and then
first giant released by a relatively new
company that tried to make one of the
most powerfully affordable phones yet in
a way both of these phones succeed at
exactly the what they wanted to do
samsung continues its smartphone
pedigree while oneplus made a big splash
with their much-sought-after device
especially considering its price it
might be some time before the oneplus
one is available widely and without
going through hoops but I think that
when that time comes anyone willing to
put in a bit of effort will flock to it
on the other hand no one can count out
Samsung and the Galaxy s5 is the most
feature packed phone they have ever
released you can't go wrong with the
galaxy s5 simply because Samsung has
proved the worth of the galaxy but if
you are looking for something different
or fresh then maybe the alternative
would definitely be the one as always
thank you guys very much for watching
and I hope you enjoyed this comparison
of the oneplus one and then this time
the Samsung Galaxy s5 the galaxy s5 is
of course the behemoth in the smartphone
space but oneplus has definitely made a
splash with their flagship device
providing a experience that is not only
affordably priced but is still very
powerful despite it and it can
essentially be a good contender to the
galaxy s5 ultimately the choice is up to
you so keep it tuned here to watch all
of the coverage of both of these phones
