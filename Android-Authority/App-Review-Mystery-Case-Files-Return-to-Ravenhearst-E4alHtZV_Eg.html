this is Joe handy from Android Authority
comm and today we'll be taking a look at
Mystery Case Files return to Ravenhurst
it's a puzzle sleuth game available in
the Google Play Store for a dollar
ninety-nine there isn't a lot in the
menus as the game really wants you to
just jump right in once in game there
are only three buttons to pay attention
to in the bottom right corner there is a
hint button that will help you along in
the event that you have some trouble in
the bottom left corner is the case file
which will let gamers read what's going
on as it's going on lastly is the
inventory button pressing it will open
the inventory and gamers can drag and
drop their items into the game to
interact with things return to
Ravenhurst is definitely a puzzle game
unlike most in the Google Play Store to
navigate players must press on the
screen in the direction they want to go
if you don't know where to go the things
on the screen that you can interact with
occasionally Sparkle to help you if you
get stuck you can always tap on the
screen right above where it says
inventory to move backward the premise
of the game is that you need to return
to Ravenhurst to finish some unfinished
business this is a sequel so if you
really want to get into the game you may
have to go back and play the first one
as well for the gameplay itself players
will have to deal with scavenger hunts
that they need to complete in order to
gain items and then the game itself is
one giant puzzle where you need to use
those items in order to progress it's
definitely a tough and creepy game with
a boatload of content and there is
always a puzzle to solve or something to
do so we gave gameplay a 4.5 out of 5
stars
the graphics in return the Ravenhurst
are actually pretty good since it is a
puzzle game there are a lot of items
hidden in plain sight throughout the
game you may find the crowbar under a
chair or a dish rack on a counter which
you normally wouldn't think to tap on
them since they usually blend seamlessly
with the background during scavenger
hunts is where things get interesting
everything is blended together in such a
way that spotting small things and
details are actually kind of difficult
this adds to the difficulty of the game
the music and sound effects along with
the general confusion and dark
atmosphere produced by the graphics
gives the game a truly creeptastic
feeling it definitely makes it more fun
to play in the dark so we gave graphics
a 4 out of 5 stars
this is a very long game as such most
players probably won't want to play it
over and over again it isn't like Angry
Birds for you progress level by level
it's more like a console or a PC game
where you play all the way through all
at once that said there is a little
replay value when you play the game each
playthrough is timed so you can play it
again to see if you can get a better
time what adds to this challenge is that
hen
generally add more time for instance if
you get a clue for an item in your
inventory it has 30 minutes to your
overall time so players may play again
to lower their overall times is it the
best in terms of replay value no but it
isn't the worst either so he gave it a 2
point 5 out of 5 star rating
overall return to Ravenhurst is probably
among the most involved games in the
Google Play Store this isn't a game that
you pick up for a few minutes complete a
task and put it down it can be played
for a long time without getting bored
because there is a storyline to progress
through if you're looking for something
quick you're not gonna find it here what
a lot of mobile games lack is the total
atmosphere returned to Ravenhurst is one
of the exceptions to this the story the
music the graphics and the gameplay all
work together to create a whole
experience it's not going to give you
nightmares or anything but you can
definitely get into it especially when
playing in low lighting conditions
perhaps this game strongest feature is
its difficulty with this excruciating
attention to detail clues to figure out
puzzles are hidden everywhere but
they're still difficult to find even
just 10 minutes into the game without a
guide it's almost guaranteed that you
will miss something we think that's
awesome when it's all added up this is
one of the most complete games in the
entire Google Play Store if you're a fan
of old school puzzle sleuth games then
this is $2.00 that you will enjoy
spending when it's all said and done we
gave overall value of 4.5 out of 5 stars
