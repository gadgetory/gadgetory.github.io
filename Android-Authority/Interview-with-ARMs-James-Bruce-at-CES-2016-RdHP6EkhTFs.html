is Darcy like vague we're here with
android authority we're here at the arm
booth and i'm here with mr. James Bruce
who is the director of mobile forearm it
straight speech again Darcy's wonderful
by seeing your CES mwc and thank you
very much it's Val my pleasure sir so it
was another banner year for arm I think
last time we spoke we were dealing with
50 billion ship connected devices that's
right and now it's up to 75 billion to
one that's right so what's really
interesting is in the last two years or
silicon partners have shipped 25 billion
SOC s now of course this goes into all
the great smartphones that you see the
devices that you're connecting to your
smartphones but also into a lot of
products that you don't even think about
I mean for example the camera that's
actually recording us that's got an ARM
processor yeah and if you just look at
things like you can there's just so many
on processes in there in your opinion I
mean you've been doing this a long time
a lot longer than me and you see a lot
of change but where do you feel the
greatest innovation came from what
sectors at what partners and 2015 well
that's a very good question and I mean
really I think you just sort of step
back about it I think great innovation
happens when consumers stop thinking of
something as technology and it's just a
product that they use it's just totally
invisible I think it's great and I think
if you let you know you look at some of
the products in 2015 that I've really
liked and it can be all the way from my
sort of unpowered cycle computer that
I'd walked through to the sort of lace
and greatest smartphones that I've had a
chance to sort of use this year and then
there's just an true say boring stuff
that's still important it's my new
wireless router yeah it's just all of
those things absolutely only now we've
just got my hands on with the low T V
Max row and it's the world's first
device that's going to ship with the
bagram turn after going 820 hmm the
benchmarks they were talking about where
I mean I know benchmarks but they were
north of 130,000 which is the highest
number I've ever possible but I was
really intrigued by so many companies
you know in 2015 you know it's a
incredible innovation and we're just
seeing so many high-caliber smartphones
launch ever aggressive price points 1 99
essentially now can get you a flexural
Experian this that's right and I think
that's the really nice thing about the
smartphone market now so there's great
smartphones at any price point and from
the perspective of consumer you really
should choose what's right for you now
someone like myself it's a premium
smartphone yep I for example you know
something like the TV or the mate eight
great friends but for example if I'm
spending my hard-earned cash in on
buying my son a smartphone I'm going to
buy the most two hundred dollars cuz
he's going to break it well yeah hey
well and so let's talk about the a 72 a
53 chipset that's in the mating this the
world's first so just offer us a bit of
an overview all right so basically if
you look at the Karen 950 in there we've
got the cortex a 72 and the a 72 is
delivered a significant increase in
performance and efficiency over the a57
and what that really means is from the
users perspective is that they can get
high performance and better battery life
I'm also combined with the a 53 that
gives you the big little thief but those
little calls there to do such a small
task and what I'm seeing is for example
on the may take that been using for last
couple of days as I'm getting stunning
battery life howling am almost
unrealistically stunning and what well I
mean a simple proof point is you know
traditionally at CES we all carry around
battery pan you need one that's right
it's a dirty secret than mobile industry
it is and the other day when I got back
from back to the room at one o'clock in
the morning it's a good excuses 30th
birthday obviously not mine the battery
life was still at sixty-eight percent
he's kidding so it managed to do a whole
day at CES and only use those three
percent
yeah I know my LG g4 I need to have at
least four thousand extra Miller I'm
mastering exist hopped up and you know
it's yeah it's just a sad reality yes
we're all very hot but I'm in well what
they did with the the mate seven it also
had stunning battery life and having
business the company many times I know
that they come from solid engineering
background you know that's what pretty
much most people do so and also the 20
double bands that possess I think that's
the most on any phone everybody
absolutely it's great especially if you
live in the US where there's just so
many different LT pans having the
ability to get great phone like the may
take I use it in the LT in the US and
then go to a to go to Europe them and
you got the LTE support know so I spent
some time with Samsung foundry and then
their memory people our own people
because i'm a nerd and they were talking
that saying that they're ready to have
10 nanometer SOC s produced by n 2 2016
so what are we looking at from going
from remember at mwc was the galaxy s6
master exynos 7420 which was 14
nanometer exactly yeah so really as soon
as you moved 10 enemy to get yet another
step in performance and also efficiency
i think what we've seen is already with
the various phones have been launched
around 14 enemy to 16 nanometers you've
seen some big step back and capabilities
compared to previous twenty or twenty
eight millimeters and 10 m 8 10
nanometers will really continue this in
these record improvements roughly forty
forty-five percent battery life savings
oh well it's always because remember
when you look at phone it's not just the
SOC you've also got the screen you also
got the radio and sir absolutely the
camera arm and really it's all about you
know delivering more performance and of
course better patching like when you're
delivering that great performances but
until you see the production devices
yeah it's always to have to give you an
absolute number absolutely so I reached
out to Intel and they said they've had
nothing to announce more related in 4
2016 SES and so you know they haven't
really refreshed there Adam mobile
also serving I think roughly 22 or 23
maybe 24 months now hmm and I think
that's a bit strange you know I'm
continues to issue new IP to his partner
ecosystem everything seems to be getting
better and better but intelligent
release endeavour anything offer and I
think that's a great thing about the arm
ecosystem is first of all it's not just
one chip guy it's multiple sets of
compartments and they're all innovating
and doing great new stuff and I think
that's really important because if
you're passionate about your friends
like I am it means that you've got cool
new devices all the time especially when
someone else is paying for them that's
even better video a lot of fun so I
think that's the real big difference
between let's say the Intel world and
the arm world is that you've got that
sort of continuous b2 and pace of
innovation which is really so delivered
these great smartphones that no matter
what price point in looking at
absolutely so just one last wrap up
question what do you think was sort of
the highlight of CES 2016 in revenue so
in my opinion and I'm being totally
nasty bastard here was the mate 8 made
it it may take just I am biased toward
smartphones says yeah but you know just
stepping back if you look at some of the
fun things that have also been at the
show I really do like the sort of smart
pet that's just so bland and reassuring
way and taken on my controller I think
the world's smallest our computer which
probably won't even a lackin videos
that's right Mike remote so small you
can't you yeah they can't even video
it's just how big is this like one it's
one millimeter yet so senseless nethers
us all about others that's right there's
energy scavenging as well everything
yeah it's just a great proof point where
you can take arm technology someone
could almost say digest that you know if
it was that encapsulated bill and they
could be absolutely absolutely that's
right yeah well another year amazing
your arm congratulations and all the
success thank you much done I look
forward to talking to you mwc sleepy too
sir all right thanks so much rubber
ducks like you bear here with James
roofs that are signing off CES 2016
