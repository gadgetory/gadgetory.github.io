everybody and reporting to you live from
Google i/o 2017 you can see a lot of the
stuff happening in the background really
I just got out of the Google Play Awards
now this is actually one of my favorite
events at this show the main reason why
is because it gives us a glimpse into
what Google views as the best
applications games VR experiences social
impact I'm going to get into all the
categories and talk a little bit about
each one a little bit later now this is
just the second annual Google Play
Awards and I really they really
tightened up the show a lot actually
they used to allow the app developers
who came up to to accept the award to do
speeches that wasn't the case this time
around so the show is actually pretty
concise pretty quick but we got a
glimpse into a number of really good
apps the first category was best indie
now a lot of people out there might
recognize one of the apps that was in
the running for this and it was called
rains
however rains was not the app that won
here the game that one was actually
mushroom 11 so doesn't going to be
trying that out the best startup award
went to an app called hooked which kind
of changes the paradigm of texting and
virtualizes it a little bit definitely
enough to check out though I was a
little bit disappointed because discord
which is the app that we use for the
Android or a podcast was in the running
but of course did not win the thing that
I noticed in the Android wear app
experience was that well in this
category there were a lot of fitness
apps which probably is apropos because
Android wear is supposed to have a
health initiative that said however the
winner of this one was runtastic I
really loved the best TV experience one
Android TV is of course going to be a
really big thing going forward
especially since Google assistant is
coming to Android TV and also to
chromecast ostensibly but Android TV
obviously is about a viewership
experience and what I noticed in this
was that there were a lot of different
Asian programming applications I don't
remember the names of them offhand but
you can see them in this clip right here
and yet there was also Netflix which was
interesting because while it's a huge
company and that became a trend later on
in different categories but the winner
of this of this award was Red Bull TV
the best VR experience went to a game
that I actually was able to try at the
unity summit 2017 you could check out
the coverage from that at VR source calm
and it's YouTube channel but virtual
virtual reality which is a hilarious
game
because it puts you in so many different
scenarios that these robots or these AI
are trying to understand the human
condition so they put you in virtual
reality which is weird because it's
virtual virtual reality and for the best
AR experience one of the runners-up was
a Wayfarer application that's the
application that you would expect in an
AR experience where you can put a couch
in the middle of your living room
virtually so you can actually tell if it
will fit inside of your room but instead
an app called world was the winner in
this category the best app for kids went
to animaljam play wild even though there
was a Teen Titans game in there which
I've actually played and I'm definitely
not a kid does multiplayer was an
interesting one because if you haven't
noticed in these clips there are a lot
of applications that were given awards
or were given nominations for awards
that have been around for a little while
now so it's not necessarily the 2017
Awards with that said best multiplayer
went to hearthstone which I know a lot
of you out there play a lot and have
been for quite a while and then kind of
a weird order in the Google Play Wars
was the fact that best app came next
which is weird because you would think
best app or even best game which came
after best app would be the last
applications or rewards that happen at
the end of the show but indeed this app
went to memorize which is an app I
definitely want to try out even though
inside of best app there was an app by
GoPro called quick which is interesting
because you have another big name in the
running for best app and even though I'm
sure there are a lot of you out there
who really wanted Pokemon go to win and
it got a bunch of cheers at the Google
Play Awards it did not win the best game
instead the best game went to
transformers forge to fight I played
this game myself and it is really good
the main reason why I won was because
they said it brought console level
gaming and graphics to Android and kind
of sets the bar for what future graphics
on Android could look like for any of
you tinker's out there if this then that
or if as they called it was the winner
of the best accessibility experience
granted it is an app that has been run
for a long time but its ability to give
you a lot of options if you're a little
bit creative was the reason why they
gave it this award and finally for Best
social impact an application that we
were all very much encouraged to check
out is share the meal share the meal is
an app that was made by the United
Nations and tries to have everybody who
downloads the app helped to provide meal
for those in developing countries so
much like the show itself I just kind of
wanted to give you a quick snapshot of
all of the different awards that were
given out and the nominees that we're
the runners-up to these awards the
Google Play Awards is a wonderful place
to kind of see where Google thinks the
best applications are and if you want to
check out some of the applications and
then let us know what you think should
have won in the comments below remember
this is all a discussion in Google i/o
2017 has been incredibly fun but we want
to hear from you about how you thought
Google i/o 2017 went so make sure you go
into the comments below tell us what you
thought about this and anything else
even the keynote which we did a
reactions video on and then you can keep
it tuned to Android thority for even
more about Google i/o because we are
your source for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
